My name is Matt and I am your operator for today\u2019s call. This conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations to begin the call. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Hologic\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call. The replay of this call will be archived on our website through Friday, February 21 and a copy of our press release discussing our first quarter results, as well as our second quarter and fiscal 2014 guidance, is available in the Overview section of the Investor Relations section of our website. Also in that section is the PowerPoint presentation related to the comments that will be made during today\u2019s opening remarks. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Hologic during the course of this call may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement and our first quarter 2014 earnings release and in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the related GAAP financial measures can also be found in our first quarter earnings release, including the financial tables in the release. Please note, today\u2019s call will consist of opening remarks from management followed by a Q&A session. Please feel free to go back into queue and if time permits, we will be more than happy to take your follow-up questions at that time. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Deb and thank you all for joining us today. I am pleased to be here this evening for my first Hologic earnings call. Before turning to our quarterly results, I would like to briefly highlight my initial experiences and outline an early roadmap for our future. In my first two months, I have been meeting with many of our team members to acquaint myself with the business and better understand the opportunities that lie ahead as well as the near-term challenges we face. My initial observations are simple. Like many businesses, we have our share of challenges, but most importantly, we have a great set of businesses and people. It is now time to reorient ourselves from an acquisition led model to one focused on organic growth via a stepped up operational focus and a clear commitment to paying down our debt. I joined the company because of its unparalleled portfolio of assets. As the dynamics of healthcare continue to evolve, the sweet spot will be products and technologies that improve patient care, make delivery of care more efficient and reduce healthcare costs. We have tremendous opportunities as our market-leading technologies are aligned with these important industry trends. While so much emphasis in our healthcare system is placed on treatment, we believe there is a huge opportunity to improve care and reduce costs through better diagnosis and we can play a role here. As an example, our 3D tomo franchise can dramatically improve cancer detection rates while also significantly reducing the need for unnecessary callbacks, a true win for patients and the healthcare system. As you know, prior to my joining the company, a strategic review process was already underway. I have become involved in that process, building on a lot of the work that has been done. We expect to wrap up that process during the current quarter. And although not entirely complete, our expectation at this time is that there will be no major changes to our corporate structure though we may pursue some select smaller divestitures. I am energized by my initial look from the inside, which has reaffirmed my belief that we have great products with compelling prospects and that our diversified business model provides a strong foundation for success. We will now focus on building and optimizing these assets to drive value creation. I have also found a committed and passionate employee base that is working resolutely to deliver our critical products and services to our customers and their patients. And I look forward to leading these talented individuals to make the changes that will enable us to accelerate growth. An organization derived success from its team\u2019s singular and acute focus on achieving clearly defined goals. And let me now be clear about our goals. One, return to growth and two pay down debt. Now for a little more color. Our first priority is to return this company to sustainable top and bottom line organic growth. How are we going to do this? A simple three pronged strategy. First, accelerate growth of the core drivers in each of our key franchises. Second, slow the declines of the businesses facing headwinds. And third, expand our key franchises outside of the U.S. In terms of the growth drivers, we are going to focus on our three major businesses : Diagnostics, Breast Health and Surgical. We have key platforms in each of these businesses that are in the early stages of a sustainable growth period that we can build on. In Diagnostics, we have a terrific instrument platform in PANTHER that we can better leverage over time, especially with further menu expansion. In Breast Health, 3D tomo should be a significant growth driver as we do a better job executing on this sizable opportunity by making sure the clinical story is more broadly understood. Simply put, no woman who knows the facts would want anything but 3D tomo for her mammogram. And in our GYN Surgical business, we have a growth driver in MyoSure which we can supplement with new products that will allow us to better leverage our sales force. Together, these three drivers create a unique and powerful force within the company that we can \u2013 we believe we can really deliver overall sales and income growth. As we drive these products in the U.S., we also have significant untapped opportunities abroad. Currently our international business represents only a quarter of our total sales. We will be dialing up the focus outside the U.S. to expand our breakthrough technologies around the world. There has been much talk about the near-term headwinds we faced including interval expansion in cervical cancer screening NovaSure pressures and our efforts to broaden reimbursement for tomo. Despite this, the opportunities provided by our core businesses should help us offset these pressures in the coming quarters as we seek to return to growth. We must also compare the company for growth by ensuring the right people are in the right positions to win with proper infrastructure in place to support them. A fresh perspective on the company is helping us determine how best to drive focus and accountability throughout the company to better drive growth across our products. While working to return to growth, we will continue using our strong cash flows to pay down debt. Those of you familiar with my management style will recall that I do not like carrying sizable debt, so we will be focused on reducing our debt balance which is consistent with the plans we have recently presented. Now turning to a discussion of the core, our results came in slightly ahead of guidance with revenues of $612 million and EPS of $0.34. While our results were ahead of guidance, we are not pleased to be reporting year-over-year revenue and earnings declines. We have work to do to return to organic growth. Fortunately, our key growth franchises made progress during the quarter. Although Diagnostics declined overall in the quarter, our molecular business posted some encouraging results, especially in the key U.S. market that bode well for the future and point to the many opportunities ahead of us in this business. The initial uptake by Quest has been very successful as increasing volume of our assays drove strong performance for the Aptima product line. As mentioned earlier, PANTHER is proving to be one of our brightest long-term opportunities. We installed our highest number of systems to-date in the U.S. during Q1 with a substantial portion resulting from competitive conversions for new accounts. We remain well on our way to achieving our stated goal of installing 1,000 PANTHERs by the end of fiscal 2015. A quick reflection for you here. My initial feeling is that we are in the early innings of beginning to realize the full potential of the Gen-Probe acquisition by combining very strong technical and scientific platforms with a more aggressive and commercially-focused selling team. I have to tell you that while much attention is focused on the assays in this space, we believe we have a significant breakthrough on the instrumentation front with PANTHER, which delivers very real and meaningful workflow improvements, a key benefit for our lab customers. In our cytology and perinatal business, we continue to face headwinds in our ThinPrep franchise as we work hard to find ways to mitigate its impact on our overall diagnostics segment. Clearly, one such opportunity is to further penetrate international markets and grow our presence there. In Breast Health, we are making good progress in the marketplace. Despite the challenging environment for capital equipment, we were able to grow our overall U.S. Breast Health business 6% in the quarter. We delivered strong growth in 3D tomo, which we expect will continue for some time as we are in the relatively early stages of this product cycle. As most of you know by now, there is remarkable and growing body of clinical evidence that supports our efforts to establish 3D tomo as the standard of care in mammography screening, which we expect will only strengthen with additional publications this year and beyond. With regard to reimbursement, we know it is an area where investors have been awaiting more visibility. At this time, we cannot commit to a timeframe in which we will achieve widespread reimbursement, although we continue to pursue parallel paths with both CMS and private payers. However, I want to be clear. This should not stand in the way of our commercialization efforts. The fact is 3D tomo makes sense economically and has strong clinical efficacy that should drive us adoption regardless of reimbursement coverage. We remain on pace to reach our fiscal year stated goal of shipping over 500 3D dimension systems in the U.S. In our Surgical business, MyoSure once again delivered strong double-digit growth. This business unit is an area, where I believe we could also benefit from providing our sales force with additional products to sell and we will be looking to ramp our innovation efforts in this division. While encouraged by what I have seen thus far, we clearly have work to do to return to sustainable top and bottom line growth. Our market-leading products are helping improve healthcare and we will build upon the strong foundation to approve our operational and financial positioning and create value for shareholders. Before turning the call over to Glenn who will discuss our financials in greater detail and review guidance, we would like to note at the beginning of this quarter, we have taken a more streamlined approach to how we present our financial results and guidance. You may notice this as you review our press release and supplementary presentation. These changes are simply part of our effort to provide a clear and concise view of our business with each quarterly update and also I would say to really be consistent. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Muir : Thank you, Steve. Unless otherwise noted, all of my commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year basis. First quarter revenues were $612 million, a decrease of 3% compared to reported revenues of $631 million and 5% compared to non-GAAP revenues of $644 million, which reflect the addition of $13.3 million primarily related to a purchase accounting adjustment recorded in the prior year. Q1 revenues last year also included $12.6 million from LIFECODES, a business we divested in March 2013. Diagnostics revenues declined 6.6% to $286 million on a reported basis and 10.5% on a non-GAAP basis when factoring in the $13.3 million adjustment primarily related to purchase accounting. As expected, the decrease is primarily attributable to the absence of sales from the divested LIFECODES business as well as declines in our ThinPrep and blood screening businesses, which were consistent with the fiscal 2014 headwinds we described on our last earnings call. As I mentioned last quarter, we will no longer refer to Legacy Hologic or Gen-Probe results, now that we are a path to one year anniversary of the acquisitions closed. However, in order to provide more visibility into our diagnostics business, we will begin discussing results in three categories : molecular, cytology and perinatal and blood screening. First, cytology and perinatal revenues declined 11% in Q1, which was in line with the expectations we have set forth last quarter largely attributable to the anticipated volume declines in our ThinPrep business as a result of expanded screening intervals in the U.S. as well as lower average selling prices internationally. Blood screening revenues declined 14% on a non-GAAP basis. The decrease was driven largely by an expected decline in assay sales related to higher than usual West Nile virus orders in the first quarter of the prior year. And in molecular, our non-GAAP revenues decreased 8%. However, on an apples-to-apples basis, when excluding the $12.6 million of LIFECODES revenues last year, the existing molecular business increased 3% during Q1. The increase was driven by double-digit growth from our Aptima women\u2019s health products, which include CT/GC, HPV, and Trichomonas. A significant portion of this growth was attributable to the strong uptake at Quest as Steve discussed. We also saw growth outside of Quest driven by Aptima HPV and growth in cancer-related assay revenues. In molecular, we are in the early stages of seeing some success, especially in the U.S. due to an increase in account closures and competitive wins. Moving on to Breast Health, revenues increased 3% to $226 million driven primarily by solid growth in 3D tomo system sales and continued growth in service revenues from our growing installed base of digital mammography systems. Breast biopsy sales were up as well. Partially offsetting these increases was the expected overall decline of 2D system sales as customers shift to 3D. We continue to see good momentum in the U.S. for 3D tomo driven by positive clinical results, decreasing payment from private payers and competitive wins. Now, turning to GYN Surgical, strong double-digit growth in MyoSure was offset by an expected decline in NovaSure resulting in revenues of $79 million, which were down 2.5%. We are making progress toward reaching the point, where continued MyoSure growth coupled with international NovaSure expansion should drive overall growth in the surgical segment. I will now review first quarter non-GAAP performance for the rest of the P&L. Gross margins were 63.2%, up 70 basis points and above our guidance range of 61.5% to 62%. Favorable product mix in our capital business related to higher 3D sales combined with higher service margins drove the improvement in the quarter. This increase in gross margins while encouraging is expected to return to the guidance range we provided for the year of 61.5% to 62% as our product mix fluctuates and we begin to increase certain manufacturing and service costs. Operating expenses of $196 million declined $2 million or 1% representing 32% of sales and coming in at the lower end of our guidance range despite revenues exceeding guidance. Operating expenses this quarter included $5.4 million for the medical device tax, which we did not incur in the year ago period. Our estimated annual tax rate is now 34.5%, 50 basis points above our guidance as certain international deductions may not be realizable. Despite this slightly higher rate, we were able to achieve earnings per share of $0.34, $0.03 higher than the guidance range we issued last quarter. Now, turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with $449 million in cash, down $272 million year-over-year and down $381 million sequentially. We continue to generate very strong cash flow, which we used to pay down debt consistent with our ongoing efforts to reduce our total debt obligation. In October, we voluntarily prepaid $100 million on our term loan B and in December we have redeemed a full $405 million of debt related to our convertible notes. We generated $180 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which puts us on track to achieve our previously stated goal of generating $500 million to $525 million in fiscal 2014. We ended the quarter with total debt obligations of $4.4 billion resulting in a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.5 times. Our return on invested capital on a trailing 12-month basis was 8.2% compared to 8.3% in fiscal 2013. For definitions and calculations of operating cash flow and ROIC, please refer to our supplementary PowerPoint presentation. And with regard to capital allocation as Steve stated deleveraging will be a primary focus as we work toward our target of a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by the end of fiscal 2017. Last quarter we announced our Board authorized a $250 million three year stock repurchase program. This plan remains in place. However, we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. Now to review our non-GAAP guidance for our fiscal 2014 Q2 and our full year, as a reminder our guidance is fully detailed in the supplementary PowerPoint presentations and assumes currency rates consistent with the average during Q1 of \u201914. It does not assume any share repurchases or divestitures. For the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we expect revenues in the range of $605 million to $615 million representing a year-over-year decline of 1% to 2% and essentially flat with the previous year on a pro forma basis excluding LIFECODES revenues of $10.6 million. Even though we are anticipating the headwinds we discussed at the outset of the year such as ThinPrep and NovaSure, we are beginning to see a nice uptick in sales of 3D tomo and our Aptima women\u2019s health assays. We expect EPS in the range of $0.32 to $0.34. For the fiscal year we are reaffirming our revenue guidance range of $2.425 billion to $2.475 billion and raising the low end of our EPS guidance range to $1.34 to $1.38 from the guidance we provided last quarter of $1.32 to $1.38 primarily due to our strong earnings performance in the first quarter and slightly offset by an increase in our tax rate at 34.5%. In summary, our first quarter results set us on solid footing to achieve our fiscal year guidance. We are encouraged with the growing customer demand for our 3D tomo systems and Aptima women\u2019s health assays. Our first priority is to execute on the organic growth strategies Steve articulated. We will remain focused on utilizing our strong cash flows to further deleverage the balance sheet. And with that I will turn the call back to Steve. Stephen MacMillan : Thanks Glenn and before we take questions, I just want to reiterate how excited I am to be here at Hologic. While there is no denying we face some near-term challenges, looking beyond them I see a bright future. We have unique platforms and products that will continue to deliver cutting edge solutions that answer the unmet needs of diverse markets. I am confident we are implementing the right strategies to create shareholder value and position Hologic for growth and success. In the months ahead we look forward to updating you on our progress and providing additional details on our vision for our future. And with that operator please open the call up to questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) At this time we will take a question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Hi, thanks for taking my question. You guys in the slides kind of removed some of the segment highlights and so just wondering if you can touch on margins for the segments, if there is anything in any of the divisions that was off trend from the prior couple of quarters. And then as a follow-up, Steve you talked a little about returning to organic growth and your predecessors have talked about return to organic growth in fiscal 2015, so I am just wondering if you are comfortable with the timelines that were previously laid out? Stephen MacMillan : Sure, I will let Glenn handle the margins and I will\u2026 Glenn Muir : Yes, Tycho let me start with the gross margins if I could. We won\u2019t be breaking out that level of detail going forward for the segments on the individual gross margins, but I will say we had a very nice quarter for gross margins in Q1, a little bit better than 63% and it is because we saw its strength on the Breast Health side. We\u2019re getting nice average on prices, nice product mix to the 3D tomo systems and we\u2019re seeing very nice service margin as the service group that we have is very profitable especially in light of kind of a delay in some hiring that we have had on the service side. But we won\u2019t be able to provide that in the same level of detail as in the past, Tycho. Stephen MacMillan : And Tycho on the growth front clearly our plan would be to generate some level of growth in 2015. This part of me says at the highest level 2014 is about stopping the declines, 2015 shoring up that base. But I feel pretty good that I think even as the course of 2014 plays out, we will hopefully show less of declines and even flatten this business out certainly before the year is out and be able to start to get towards growth for next year. And it\u2019s really driven by my confidence in especially the U.S. Molecular Diagnostics business and our U.S. Breast Health businesses. And by the way those two and frankly to drove in even that the surgical business that will grow, just the U.S. for those three businesses accounts for about 70% of our revenue. And I think all three of those can show sequential improvements through the year, sequentially obviously they were down in this quarter for two out of three Breast Health was up but basically the diagnostics business should be less down towards moving towards positive, the surgical business should be moving towards positive, Breast Health of anything will probably accelerate a little bit through the year. And I think really hopefully have us accelerating through this year and setting the platform for growth next year. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Great. Thank you. Operator : At this time we\u2019ll take our next question which will be from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies Group. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies Group : Thanks and welcome, Steve. Maybe just a little bit more on your statement on sort of the slowing the declines in some of these businesses, they\u2019ve been facing some headwinds pretty consistently here, some of them are certainly secular, you mentioned that the shift in ThinPrep testing and also some of your customers in diagnostics have been talking pretty steadily about utilization and pricing declines. So may be a little bit more on actually how you sort of reverse some of the trends we\u2019ve been seeing pretty consistently for the past year or so and then just a follow-up on capital structure comments that you had? Stephen MacMillan : Sure. Let me start on the trends and first and foremost it\u2019s going to be about driving growth and accelerating further growth on the growth franchises. The second part was to your jack point of slowing the decline; I think we\u2019ve got several things here. One is just sales force execution and by the way I\u2019m talking about slowing these on the margin probably but things like even NovaSure or ThinPrep making sure that our reps aren\u2019t just accepting the macro headwinds and make the extra call. Let\u2019s still remind people why our products are superior to those in the competitive set and still try to get those extra sales. I think sometimes it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy when you got all the headwinds you just sort of throw up your hands. And I think by just shining it brighter light and a greater focus and remaining people that the way we grow is really a combination of not losing as much on one side so you\u2019re just replenishing the other side. It\u2019s a bit of accelerating the positives but trying to do what you can to hold on fight off the declines a little bit. Having said that let\u2019s be clear. The ThinPrep, NovaSure, those are still legitimate headwinds, those will continue to decline, but if we can even slow the rate of decline from minus 10% to minus 9% or minus 8% on the margin those will be improvements and then eventually frankly I hate to say but anniversary-ing will start to help us a little bit as we go certainly into 2015 and beyond. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies Group : That\u2019s helpful. And just on the capital structure, can you maybe walk through the strategy there for net pay downs in terms of prioritization. Should we expect pay downs on the higher interest portions of the cap structure or are there restrictive covenants that require your initial pay downs to be allocated toward the term loans? Glenn Muir :  Yes, Anthony, let me talk a little bit there. When we look at the pieces of the debt for a moment between the term loan A and B and then the senior note and then the convertible, we really have three pieces. The senior note, we don\u2019t have an ability until 2015 to do anything with that and that is the highest interest rate. Our focus today is to try to lower the term loan B, because that\u2019s the highest interest remaining of what\u2019s left. The convert actually has a small coupon today. So that\u2019s where our focus is. The B is also variable at the moment. So it would be the priority as we generate cash and pay down debt. Operator : At this time, we will take a question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : Good afternoon. Stephen MacMillan : Hey, David. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : Steve, how are you? Stephen MacMillan : Great. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : I wanted to come back to something you focused on the call here. Your return to growth was clearly the message on the call, but you also mentioned the need to invest in areas like the o-U.S. to drive that growth. So I do think a question that many holders have is can you return to growth without a return to increased spending? So does the EPS guidance give you the flexibility you need to accelerate growth and if it does, can you help us understand how you reallocate some of that spending to focus on the areas you think are best suited to accelerate that growth? Stephen MacMillan : Sure. I think to be clear the current EPS guidance does give us that latitude. And we are already talking within the team as I see some pockets of strength as to some additional investments we could make even this year whether it\u2019s sales or frankly R&D projects to kind of self-fund some additional growth and still deliver on the EPS line and really start to set ourselves up for the future. So I think overall as you well know, we have got a pretty good operating margin and we are going to have to increase I think some spending in R&D and probably sales force expansions, but I think we can find that money internally so that we don\u2019t have the depressed margin to do it. As you also well know and I probably articulated, some of that is not going to affect our business in the next few quarters, but 2015 and beyond hopefully they start to at least see some of it. Internationally, the opportunities here are enormous. And I will tell you I saw some pockets \u2013 we saw some pockets of growth internationally that the total numbers kind of mask, but our core business is an example in Europe. All three franchises showed some reasonable and very good growth in Europe. So at a time when I think a lot of companies are challenged in Europe, I think we have got opportunities there and it will by shining a brighter light really allow us to invest further, but again without really seeing margin decline. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : Okay, thanks Steve. Very helpful. And then next question just on gross margins, I think you talked about that gross margin trend fading across the quarters. I guess maybe give us a little more detail about that, it was a stronger GM that you saw in the year ago period, but it\u2019s just not clear to me why that GM would fade so dramatically throughout the balance of the year given the strength here and considering the growth was so depressed here in the first quarter, you still had a very strong GM number. Help us understand specifically what drives that depression throughout the quarters? Glenn Muir : Sure, David. So the gross margin percentage in Q1 was a bit more than 63%, which is the highest that we have posted in sometime. And it\u2019s fair to say it is not one item, it\u2019s a whole host of things that kind of clicked and found a place for us during the quarter. Some of it was a very nice product mix to the Breast Health side, an increase in service without any increase in service cost, so an enormous amount of gross margins from that. We were heavily weighted to the U.S. this quarter more so than other quarters. We are actually a little bit lower on the international side. So we have better price in the U.S. We did have some manufacturing variances that were positive. We had very good absorption, because our inventory was up for the quarter. I know it sounds like a laundry list, but it really is. We did have a slowdown in hiring and expenses in Q1. These are the things I expect not to fully reverse, but even out for the remainder of the year. So at this point in the year after only one quarter, we would be more comfortable with the current guidance that we have already provided the 61.5% to the 62%. Stephen MacMillan : And David, I would add an overall comment too. I think one of the things I want to make sure we do is we establish our new reputation here is be very credible as we are going forward and not over celebrate something and having us think we are at a new level because obviously I think we have gotten into the \u2013 trying to point out the real positives in a quarter and neglecting some of the others. And I think we have heard from all of you credibility is key. You know that\u2019s a very important mantra of mine. So I think this quarter was unusually good, we would love to celebrate. Hopefully, you know we are going to be working hard to improve upon even the guidance, but don\u2019t want to get ahead ourselves at this stage in time. Operator : At this time we will take the question from Rich Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Rich Newitter - Leerink Partners : Hi, thanks for taking the questions and welcome to Hologic Steve. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Rich. Rich Newitter - Leerink Partners : Maybe I can just start with a little bit bigger picture. I appreciate and thank you for giving us the comments on 2015 and that there is likely a return to growth in store in that time period. Can you maybe give us a sense especially in light of the fact that you don\u2019t see any dramatic strategic shifts in the businesses right now or restructuring of the businesses, what\u2019s the long-term growth potential is of the assets you have in place? Stephen MacMillan : You know what, I want to careful at this stage getting into long-term projections. I feel good, but I have got to get my sea legs a little bit further and I want to be careful not to get too far ahead of ourselves. Sorry about that. Rich Newitter - Leerink Partners : That\u2019s okay, that\u2019s fair. Stephen MacMillan : Our long-term right now is made out of starting to execute better quarter-over-quarter while we sorted out. But I do feel like franchises we are in should be nice growth drivers. Rich Newitter - Leerink Partners : Okay. And just going back to your comment on reallocation of investment, specifically with respect to sales \u2013 I think you said reinvigorating the sales force and some of the businesses that you are seeing secular challenges, how do you view that, are there incentive structures you will put in place, what specific initiatives can we expect from the next few quarters? Stephen MacMillan : Sure. Some of it\u2019s as simple as really looking at the call calendars and making sure that while we are driving growth on one franchise we are not completely neglecting the others. It is setting up the quarters and frankly I think team has already done a pretty good job here of making sure that the sales reps quotas include multiple product lines aren\u2019t just totals. So it\u2019s just driving down to that kind of level of detail making sure we have got the right people in the right focus areas. And then the second part will be probably particularly outside the U.S. starting to look at where are there pockets that we might expand our sales organizations. Operator : At this time we\u2019ll take the question from Bill Quirk at Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bill Quirk - Jefferies: Great, thanks, good afternoon. Steve first question and I realize it\u2019s a bit of tricky one, but given the importance of Gen-Probe in your future plans, here is one of the three-pronged growth strategies, as well as just kind of considering the overall level of change that the organization has been through over the past year, can you talk a little bit about the morale of the organization and just help us think a little bit about retention there too? Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Bill, it\u2019s a great question. I will answer to you exactly what I told our Board last week. I think when I arrived here there were a number of people, dare I say with one foot out the door. And I think with my arrival a whole bunch of them kind of stopped that foot out the door, stopped making phone calls out and are very intrigued. But some are \u2013 many and especially I think frankly out in San Diego are still waiting to believe. But they want to believe they have invested their heart and souls and that so many people at the grassroots level of this company have spent their lives really helping build it up and want this company to fulfill its rightful potential. And I think we really have a lot of them reengaged, reenergized as we are going forward. So we are not quite where I want to be as I told our Board I am not sure lot of these people are ready to run into the burning building behind me, but I think will be there here in the coming months. I am very encouraged by what I am seeing. But we do have work to do. You don\u2019t go through that the amount of leadership turmoil that we went through both at the top of Hologic and also frankly at the Gen-Probe facility in San Diego in a 12 months period without having a meaningful and significant impact on morale. So \u2013 but I think we have bottomed and are on the way up now. But \u2013 and I do think that\u2019s going to be a big driver of performance in the future. When you have people with one foot out the door 5 0\u2019clock rolls around they are ready to head home. When they believe what they\u2019re working in they\u2019re giving you that extra effort, they\u2019re making that extra sales call, they\u2019re working that extra project and product development and that\u2019s where we need to be. Bill Quirk - Jefferies: Understood. And then just as a follow-up for Glenn, certainly good to hear about the overall Aptima performance; obviously understand that Quest had a hand to play there, can you speak a little bit too, I don\u2019t know if organic is the right term to use here but kind of what the Aptima franchise look like without the benefit of Quest? Stephen MacMillan :  Organic is the right phrase, Quest is organic, so but no \u2013 I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s me being a wise guy. I\u2019ll hand it over to Glenn. Glenn Muir :  Yes that was my answer too. Yes, Bill that\u2019s a tough one. We really can\u2019t comment and try to pull out what Quest contributed, but we\u2019re very happy with the uptake I mean we talked about last quarter that Quest had ordered and had installed a large number of their new TIGRIS systems in the summer time. So this was the first quarter we begun to see some real benefit from Quest. The real pickup is on the Aptima CT/GC side. I think some of the new Aptima assays like Trichomonas more of a new test. We\u2019ll be yet to see going forward as will be HPV. So there is a lot of ground for us to pickup with Quest. So we\u2019re very happy with their initial push for the product, get into those TIGRIS is up and running. Bill Quirk - Jefferies: But it is broader than Quest as well. Glenn Muir : No doubt. Stephen MacMillan : In terms of the growth. Operator : Moving forward you\u2019ll hear from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Please go ahead. Brian Weinstein - William Blair : Hi, thanks for taking the questions and good afternoon. Stephen, I was hoping to push you just a little bit more on the o-U.S. situation. It\u2019s obviously only 25% or so of revenues. It\u2019s been an area that people have talked about investments here for a while, and Gen-Probe has been an asset, that\u2019s been notoriously underrepresented outside the U.S. So I\u2019m just curious if you can be a little bit more specific on things you can do, are there specific products that you\u2019re going to highlight o-U.S., are there specific territories, and can you give us an update on the Far East and China and what\u2019s going on there? Thanks. Stephen MacMillan :  Sure. Great question. I think it does get down to a granular focus on how we start to build it by franchise and by country and it\u2019s understanding the reimbursement environments in each of the major countries and what we can do to influence that. So if I would articulate a strategy here, this is clearly going to take time, but it does start with market access, do we have the right reimbursement for the right product lines in the right countries? And if you really dial it down I would tell you, I just don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been very focused there, we may have talked about it in the past but the results and there I\u2019d say even the internal reports and Glenn and I had a lot of good discussions about it. The internal reporting system within the company to me is not been as focused on even looking at the international business within the months and within the quarters and I\u2019m a big believer that what you measure allows you to ask the questions and drive it. So now to go one level further down in granularity, if I look the molecular diagnostics business, clearly as you mentioned it\u2019s ballpark, it\u2019s about 15% of our revenue is outside the U.S. There is no reason to be that low I mean that\u2019s obviously from more of the Gen-Probe base, where the cytology piece of our business is probably more like 30% plus outside the U.S. If we think about the Breast Imaging business generally still probably three quarters of it is in the U.S. and then the GYN Surg business frankly is about almost 90% is in the U.S. So right now we\u2019re literally going through \u2013 if you take Europe as an example country-by-country, franchise-by-franchise, okay. If we look at France what is the opportunity in France, well maybe there is a big opportunity for call it the surgical business whatever where that\u2019s the kind of granularity we\u2019re starting to talk about. And as I mentioned earlier I think we\u2019ve got a very good leader of our European business who is bringing that kind of discipline and focus to the organization. The \u2013 you mentioned Middle East and some of the other areas I think we\u2019ve been a little more scattershot of capital sales on the Breast Imaging side where we\u2019ve had some very nice business over time, but frankly pretty up and down. And I think part of what we\u2019re going through this quarter and by some of the international numbers look weaker was we\u2019re going against some big sales in both Latin America, the Middle East and even the CIS last year in this quarter. So starting to drive if we get the surgical business and the molecular businesses involved in those countries as well, it will give us more of a stable growth pattern. China, to be quite candid, we have got some work to do. We have done an acquisition there many of you know, the TCT acquisition a few years back, probably not one of our most shining moments. We are in the midst of doing some work and making some leadership evolutions there, where I think that will \u2013 it\u2019s certainly been a drag to the last few quarters and will probably continue to be a drag in the short-term while we get that turned around and hopefully see better growth out of Europe and other areas to offset it while we get that shored up. If I look at Japan, Japan is a tiny part of our business relative to traditional norms. So again, huge opportunity, I think it\u2019s now really started to drill down and these opportunities will be much more programmatically probably 2016 and beyond want to certainly start to get going on them in 2015, but as you start to think about really penetrating some of these businesses, it\u2019s much more the longer term play than the next few quarters. Brian Weinstein - William Blair : Thank you very much. Operator : At this time, we will go to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. Stephen MacMillan : Sure Isaac. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : Hi, Steve. I just want to ask one on the overall volume environment, we have seen obviously some pretty good results not only from you guys, but other companies across MedTech and actually Abbott Labs (ph) this quarter. So I am wondering if you thought you saw any pull forward in volume in the calendar fourth quarter and trying to get a sense as a result what you guys are assuming for seasonality on a sequential basis as we move into first calendar quarter? Stephen MacMillan : Sure. I don\u2019t think we saw lot of pull forward from our customers be in the quarter. Typically, we do see a little bit of a downtick based on our set of businesses in the calendar first quarter, which is why our revenue guidance for this quarter kind of brackets roughly. Typically, we go down our revenue guidance actually has us probably flat sequentially, which maybe modest improvement in terms of growth rates or lack of declines, but I don\u2019t think we really saw lot of pull forward from the quarter. Glenn, do you have anything to add there? Glenn Muir : No. I think that sums up, Steve. We haven\u2019t seen any pull-through in Q1 December and we don\u2019t have a lot of seasonality built into our business anymore now that we have especially on a consolidated basis. When we look at the surgical business, we always have the reset of insurance deductibles that hit us in the March quarter, but that\u2019s offset by other parts on the molecular side, the diagnostic side. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on the comment you made on potential select divestitures, just wondering if you had an updated view on what kind of criteria you will place on those decisions? That will be helpful in framing your thoughts there. Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Sure. At the end of the day, we are obviously focusing on what we can do to grow our business. The three big franchises for the most part have very good growth drivers. There maybe some products in some of those areas that we might think may not necessarily be growth drivers that we may look at, very much on the smaller side of things. Operator : At this time, we will move forward and take a question from Jayson Bedford of Raymond James. Jayson Bedford - Raymond James : Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to circle back to gross margin and the strength in the quarter, you hinted that Breast Health was strong. Just wondering did you see a bigger impact from upgrades meaning those folks going from as I mentioned 2D to as I mentioned 3D and wondering if that had a positive impact on gross margin in the quarter? Stephen MacMillan : No, that actually wasn\u2019t it, Jayson. It was just more 3D in total. It wasn\u2019t the upgrades. I mean, those are potentially opportunities that continue to be out there. When we think about 3D sales, there is still \u2013 the upgrade portion is still between 20% and 30%. There really wasn\u2019t a shift to the upgrade, but every quarter, you are correct, we continue to sell 2D dimensions into the U.S. market and those all could be upgraded at some point in the future. Jayson Bedford - Raymond James : Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, what\u2019s left in terms of converting your business with Quest? Stephen MacMillan : Well, the TIGRIS units are in place at Quest today and it\u2019s a matter of them adopting all the molecular assays. So the first to adopt was on the CT/GC side. We are expecting ramp ups over time of both Trichomonas as they move to NAT testing for Trich and then also on the HPV side. I \u2013 we will also say that the arrangement with Quest does expand hopefully our use of ThinPrep as well. They were a company that used both ThinPrep and SurePath. So we would have the expectation of some increases on the ThinPrep as well, so we are early on in all those pieces right now Jason. Jayson Bedford - Raymond James : Okay, thank you. Operator : At this time, we will take the question from Jon Block with Stifel. Jon Block - Stifel: Great. Thanks and good afternoon. Maybe the first one just to focus on G&A for a second, it looks like it was a big increase in G&A and maybe if you can just be a little bit more specific where that went in the quarter, was that towards building some of the long-term international infrastructure Steve that you referenced or was it geared more towards augmenting the sales force with some domestic opportunities? Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : It was less around the long-term than I would clearly like to say. Glenn do\u2026 Glenn Muir : No, Jonathan it\u2019s kind of no to those questions. The G&A went up because number one we have the med device tax year-over-year in there, but also in the December quarter we are heavily weighted with our SG&A expenses and all our national tradeshows. So this Q1 is our expensive quarter in total. In addition, those expenses include a number of stock options and equity type expenses. We had some leadership changes those thing don\u2019t come cheap, so some of that is included in the G&A as well. Stephen MacMillan : Well, good. That was Glenn\u2019s right way of saying that the hiring of me drove our SG&A up a little bit, but we are going to make up for that, don\u2019t worry. Glenn Muir : Steve, please don\u2019t mind, but I meant it to be high value though, however, you did take that right, Jonathan. Jon Block - Stifel: Absolutely, understood. And then maybe this is a follow-up, Steve you have mentioned I think referred to some additional offerings in the GYN segment and is that something you can see in internal R&D or are there opportunities sort of in the more immediate term from possible call tuck-in acquisitions? Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Sure. I think it will be a bit of both, clearly I think just by starting to talk again and not just talk and people are seeing it as really focusing on organic growth. We have got that group as an example. One that was feeling like a little bit of redheaded stepchild I think in a big company for a bit being reenergized, I love that business it\u2019s one I am comfortable with. And to me it\u2019s all about constant innovation, upgrades to your existing products and starting to talk with that team about that. And also giving them license to say hey, folks this maybe one where if you find a small product line tuck-in acquisition. Even something with $10 million or $15 million for that business would be very meaningful that then we can grow those things over time. So I think empowering them to start to look both internally and externally is the focal point. So again, nothing that\u2019s going affect the trajectory next quarter, but that mindset I think really will start to pay dividends here and hopefully 2015 and beyond. Jon Block - Stifel: Great, thank you. Operator : At this time, we will move to Vijay Kumar with ISI Group. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group : Thanks guys. So maybe my first question for Steve, I just wanted to ask you about, has there been any major surprises either for the upside or the downside since you are down the role of CEO, what\u2019s been \u2013 what\u2019s sort of \u2013 what\u2019s been the focus for you as you can sort of get your arms around the business? Stephen MacMillan : Sure. I think the upside is probably that our sales teams and some of our sales leaders, there has probably been a few more changes there over the last year or two to the positive. I frankly thought the organization might be slightly sleepier given the market share positions, but I think there is actually some very good strength there which gives me the latitude as we do some shifting around the organization the priorities to I think really help drive it forward. I think that, so yes hopefully that answered it. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group : Got it. And maybe one for Glenn, would you be willing to comment what proportion of your GYN Surgical businesses might show right now and what was the decline in 2D mammography business? Thanks. Glenn Muir : Yes, let me think about how best to answer that, Vijay. We \u2013 on the GYN Surgical side in the 10-Q coming out in a couple of days we\u2019ll talk about the MyoSure increase and it will talk about at $5 million increase in MyoSure. So that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a nice double-digit growth. When we think about MyoSure itself the 10-Q also talked about a NovaSure decrease of about $7 million. So that\u2019s a slight single, low single digit kind of decline. What we\u2019re looking for is for that to level off in the NovaSure side, we are encouraged on the international side, we have gotten some approvals that we haven\u2019t had in prior years. So we\u2019re at a point we think where the MyoSure growth will begin to overtake any kind of NovaSure decline, we\u2019re pretty close to that. On the 2D I don\u2019t know if we talked about specifics on the 2D decline, but this is what we\u2019ve been waiting for I mean at some point the 2D goes to zero, right, I mean we are expecting everything in the future to be 3D that is the way the market should move, tomo should become the product out there because of how clinically sub-carrier it is today. If we think about dimensions because I know I commented on dimensions before the new product line. Dimensions are about 80% of that total digital mammography product line item. Operator : At this time, we\u2019ll take a question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company : Hi, good afternoon. One would think pricing has to be under pressure due to broader challenges in the diagnostic and healthcare space and specifically due to the impact of the Quest agreement I guess treating that as organic using the logic you applied in response to an earlier question, could you provide data on pricing volume trends specifically within the diagnostic segment and then also more broadly across the Company? Glenn Muir : Yes let\u2019s think about that for a moment. I think it\u2019s hard to be general about diagnostics so Doug. And I think we all understand what\u2019s going on with ThinPrep. Here in the U.S. that is volume, volumes have dropped on the ThinPrep side. We\u2019re looking to soften that decline over the next year. So international it is true that ThinPrep, the ASPs have dropped a bit as well, part of that is intentional on our part especially in Asia as we\u2019ve moved more to some dealer type arrangements away from direct for a whole host of reasons. On the diagnostic side, we do see more lab consolidation; so that is going to have a slight impact on ASPs. I think in general though we are seeing volumes increase as we win more account, more account closures, many of those are competitive but many of the competitive wins do come with a bit lower ASPs at the trend that we would expect to go forward but it is also part of the future strategy as PANTHERs get placed into the field, it really does provide us with that platform for the future I mean and this is really key to what we\u2019re trying to do. We\u2019re talking about particularly assays today that a lab they only have on or two of our assays that PANTHER goes in they set running CT/NG, next thing they are running as HPV, they don\u2019t yet have Trichomonas, Trichomonas begins to be a bigger part of the market. So this is all trying to place from our perspective as many PANTHERs as we can. And as Steve said this was our best PANTHER placement quarter. I would expect it go up next quarter. We\u2019re seeing very great uptake on PANTHER itself and I think it is an automation that will really set us apart in the market today and I think for the first time we have a full set of assays that we can take advantage of. So hopefully some of that shift as we go forward. Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company : So that\u2019s helpful. I guess with that in mind maybe two quick very related follow-ups. The first is given everything you just described Glenn is that part of the explanation for why you would expect the gross margin comes under pressure a bit more moving forward? Glenn Muir : Well I was really trying to comment on the remainder of FY \u201814 though Doug. And we have to remember for FY \u201814 we\u2019re not guiding to any revenue overall consolidated revenue increase. So I would expect this pretty \u2013 this range of 61%, 62%. As we look into FY \u201815 I think it changes. I think there will be the ability for us to drive additional margin both at the gross margin and the operating margin level as our revenues begin to tick up in part because of these new placements of PANTHERs. So I think FY \u201814 is more about it being a flat revenue year than it is anything else. Stephen MacMillan : We will as we go forward though I would say outside the U.S. as we start to grow that business outside the U.S. that will probably come at some lower margins. So I wouldn\u2019t model lot of margin \u2013 gross margin expansion, because we will have, to your point, Doug, there will be some pricing pressure in the U.S. and as we go outside the U.S., there maybe some slightly lower selling prices, but the key will be to growing the top line fast enough to be able to keep the overall margins in good shape. Operator : At this time, we will take one more question for the day. This will be from Bill Bonello with Craig-Hallum. Bill Bonello - Craig-Hallum: Hey, great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Just a couple of follow-ups on the women\u2019s health business, you talked a lot about the traction that you are getting currently with PANTHER, which sounds positive. I guess my question is you didn\u2019t talk much about sort of the future with the women\u2019s health business and what you are doing to drive sort of increased growth across the installed base or what you will be doing and sort of what you may need to do to remain competitive as other companies, whether it\u2019s Cepheid or Roche sort of continue to introduce new assays and new instruments? And then I have a follow-up on profitability. Stephen MacMillan : Sure. We are clearly very well invested in pipeline developments on additional women\u2019s health assays, a scenario that obviously is the near and dear to our heart over time and will continue to be a very strong level of core competence. It\u2019s also an area where I tell you when you combine the physician sales force that we have along with the lab sales force, I think it\u2019s an area that really we should continue to be able to drive some good growth despite the competitive position there. Bill Bonello - Craig-Hallum: Okay. And then just in terms of profitability, is there anything that you can do with the ThinPrep business given that sort of the structural decline in volumes that\u2019s happening and the potential that, that might continue? Is there anything you can do to sort of right-size that business? Do you have any pricing power at all? Just thoughts on how you might make that business more profitable? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I would tell you, it\u2019s actually very profitable today and it\u2019s frankly helping spin off a lot of profitability to invest in other parts of the business. Like any businesses in decline, we will always be looking to do we have the right resource allocation and everything else on it, but again, kind of like we said earlier, you want to be careful, you don\u2019t pull resources away from it too much. It\u2019s a remarkably great franchise. And some of the questions we are asking ourselves are, are there other ways we can breathe new life into that ThinPrep vial was an example. So we will certainly be seeking both maximized profit on that, but also figuring out how to either stop the declines or even figure out the ways to turn it back to a growth business over time and on a global basis. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude the question-and-answer session and this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic Incorporated second quarter fiscal 2014 earnings conference call. My name is Greg, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Hologic's second quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer and Glenn Muir, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will consist of opening remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. The replay of this call will be archived on our website through Friday, May 23 and a copy of our second quarter release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Also in that section is a supplemental second quarter financial presentation related to the comments that will be made during today's opening remarks. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call may be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statements included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the GAAP can also be found in our second quarter earnings release. I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen MacMillan. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Deb, and thank you all for joining us today. On today's call, I will cover three key topics. One, our second quarter results and highlights, two, actions taken since I joined the company and three, the results of our recently completed strategic review and how they relate to our plans for growth and value creation. I will then turn the call over to Glenn for more detailed financial discussion. Starting with our results and highlights. In the second quarter, we generated $625 million in revenues and $0.37 in EPS, both of which were a bit better than we expected at this stage in our turnaround. After experiencing a decline in revenues during Q1, we were encouraged to deliver modest year-over-year growth. Much work lies ahead, but these results are a sign that we are making progress toward our initial goal of reversing the sales declines. While one quarter alone does not make a trend, it does show we do indeed have near-term growth opportunities to offset the much discussed headwinds. I would now like to touch on some key highlights from the quarter. In our diagnostics business, the Japanese Red Cross, or JRC, selected our new collaboration partner, Grifols, to screen the country's 5.3 million annual blood donations. This represents a huge win for Grifols and us and is a strong validation of Hologic's Panther system and its capabilities. The JRC made its selection after rigorous scientific evaluation of our instrumentation and assays in comparison with the latest offerings from the incumbent vendor. The technological advantage of the Panther and the benefits it delivers in terms of workflow, reliability and ease of use are becoming more evident in ongoing competitive evaluations. Implementation of this contract will begin toward the end of our fiscal 2014. Therefore, the majority of the initial financial contribution will be realized in fiscal 2015. This win is a great way to kick off our new relationship with Grifols and we look forward to working closely with them to win additional business around the globe. The JRC's endorsement of Panther platform builds an another strong quarter of Panther placements overall. We are seeing growing interest in the Panther platform and are increasingly confident we will reach our goal of installing 1,000 units by the end of fiscal 2015. While most of the Panther placements do not have the same visibility as a major contract win such as the JRC, they are nonetheless just as important to our business, even if they are occurring one lab at a time. Each and every placement helps lock in sockets that can yield ongoing revenue growth especially with further menu expansion over time. We also made solid progress on executing on our opportunity to convert Quest testing volumes to our Aptima family of assays during the quarter. And even aside from Quest, we are driving broader adoption of our Aptima HPV test and are encouraged by our progress. The strength in our molecular and blood screening businesses largely offsets declines in our cytology and perinatal business, which are attributable to ongoing ThinPrep headwinds in the U.S. due to interval expansion. Within our breast health business, we saw two important developments during the quarter. First, global sales grew by a healthy 8% versus last year, driven by increasing adoption of our 3-D mammography technology and we are now well on track to reach our stated goal of placing at least 500 3-D mammography systems in the U.S. this year. Second, in addition to the strong 3-D mammography results, we received positive news on the reimbursement front. In early March, the AMA CPT Editorial Panel announced that the application for breast tomosynthesis was accepted for three Category I CPT codes for both screening and diagnostic mammograms .While we will not know the exact codes and associated rates until November, we do know the beginning in calendar 2015, there will be three new CPT codes for breast tomosynthesis. Although it will take some time for the regional Medicare carriers and private payers to implement coverage of reimbursement for these codes, this is an exciting development for our breast health business as well as for the patient seeking to benefit from this technology. Clearly, we are building momentum and are optimistic that upcoming developments on the reimbursement front, as well as the growing body of peer-reviewed publications will stimulate further adoption of what and many of the medical community view as a game changing technology. When you look more broadly at the 3-D mammography market opportunity, it's also important to keep in mind that today less than 10% of the U.S. digital mammography installed base is 3-D. In other words, we are building momentum and still have significant growth opportunities ahead of us. Moving on to our surgical business. While sales were still down versus year ago, the trends are modestly encouraging as growth in MyoSure as well as broader international opportunities for both MyoSure and NovaSure are helping offset the domestic NovaSure headwinds. Finally, while much smaller, even our skeletal business reversed multiple quarters of sharper declines and posted growth of over 4% in the quarter. Overall, the key take away from this quarter is that every franchise showed improved performance, demonstrating that despite the headwinds we face, our core assets have the ability to perform better and drive overall company growth. The second item I would like to cover is actions taken since joining the company in December. My initial focus has been on performing an in-depth evaluation of our leaders, our businesses and overall structure and our products. In March, we announced key changes to senior leadership that will play a significant role in establishing the team that will not only help meet our near-term turnaround efforts, but also create and execute a long-term plan to generate sustainable growth. I am extremely pleased that Eric Compton has joined as our Chief Operating Officer. In this role, he will oversee the day-to-day operations of our business units, as well as our global R&D and manufacturing efforts. Eric joined us from Johnson & Johnson, where he enjoyed a long and successful career with increasing responsibilities, most recently as the Worldwide President of Ortho Clinical Diagnostics. I am also pleased to have Claus Egstrand on board as Hologic's Senior Vice President and General Manager of International. Claus joined us from Merck and has a tremendous amount of experience overseeing a variety of international businesses within large organizations over his 30 plus year career. Having worked previously with both of these leaders, I am confident that we are building a team comprised of the right people in the right roles to win. On a separate senior management team note, we also announced that after a 25 year career here at Hologic, Glenn will be retiring. I would be remiss if I didn't thank Glenn for his leadership and significant contributions over the years. We are in an active process to bring in a new CFO and are grateful that Glenn will remain in his role to ensure a seamless transition and continued execution of our financial strategies. Before I do turn the call over to Glenn, I want to update you on the third item, our recently concluded strategic review. We promised on our last quarterly call to provide the conclusions of the review. And to be perfectly clear, the purpose of the review was always to determine how best to maximize shareholder value. We carefully assessed a wide range of options including significant divestitures, but concluded that the best near-term path of a greater value creation is to, one, accelerate growth of our existing businesses, two, no major divestitures, those are our opportunities to divest fringe assets and three, implement more effective capital allocation and financial planning with a major opportunity to lower our tax rate significantly over time. And now for a little more detail on how we plan to achieve these goals. Beginning with item one, accelerating organic growth. Our game plan for growth can be distilled down to three focus areas, people, products and global expansion. As I mentioned earlier, we have made important changes to our senior management team, with an eye toward providing strong leadership, improved execution and performance oriented accountability. In addition to people, our products are the core of our efforts to return to sustainable organic growth. We have a terrific portfolio of products and our path to growth will require an ongoing innovation engine. To support this, we are implementing initiatives designed to produce a steady stream of new products in each of our businesses. In addition to significant innovations, we believe we can also drive value through ongoing product improvements in line extensions that broaden the reach of our products in the global marketplace. Simply put, our plan will require additional investments in R&D and international expansion but we plan to fund these via sales growth and reallocation of internal spending. As indicated last quarter, global expansion will be a critical element to our growth strategy over the long-term. We have many best in class products that command leading market shares domestically yet hold disproportionately low market share positions internationally. This is an area where new members of our senior management team will add value and insight. With regard to divestitures, as we indicated our last call, we do not plan to make any significant divestitures at this time. That said, we will be doing some pruning around the edges. Although there will be a modest near-term impact to our top line, we believe the trade-off is worthwhile since these are among our lowest margin businesses. Glenn will speak further to some of our efforts in this area. Finally, our strategic review reaffirmed at that our primary commitment from a capital allocation standpoint is to pay down debt. In addition, one of the biggest initiatives to emerge from our strategic review process is the need to immediately focus on long-term planning that will reduce our tax rate. This certainly will take time but represents a clear opportunity to improve profitability. Fortunately, our tax planning initiative dovetails nicely with our plans to further globalize the business since greater resources will need to be allocated to non-U.S. markets. With that I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Muir : Thank you, Steve. Unless otherwise noted, all of my commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year non-GAAP basis. Second quarter revenues of $625 million were up 1% compared to prior year of $619 million. Prior year revenues included $10.6 million from LIFECODES, a business we sold in March 2013. Diagnostics revenues of $291 million declined 4%. These results were in line with our expectations as the decrease is primarily attributable to the LIFECODES divestiture and lower ThinPrep revenue. Revenues in our cytology and perinatal business declined 4%. International revenues were flat, while U.S. revenues declined in the high single digit, primarily as a result of lower sales of ThinPrep due to the ongoing screening interval expansion. Our molecular diagnostics business declined 8%, primarily as a result of our divestiture of LIFECODES. However, operationally, after adjusting for LIFECODES, molecular grew 1%. Overall performance in molecular was also mapped a bit by weakness in our flu business. However, our core Aptima franchise experienced healthy growth in the low double digits resulting primarily from strong uptake at Quest and broader adoption of Aptima HPV. Blood screening revenues were up 5.5%. Strong international growth helped offset the anticipated impact of lower domestic blood donations. The recent JRC win will build on our strength in international markets. Moving on to breast health. Revenues increased 8.5% to $239 million driven primarily by very strong growth in 3-D mammography system sales, which drove in 8% overall increase in breast health product sales. We also realized incremental revenues to a smaller extent from growth in sales of our C-View system, as well as from biopsy system sales, specifically the Eviva. Solid service revenue growth of 9% was driven by a growing installed base of digital mammography systems. Partially offsetting these increases was the expected overall decline of 2-D mammography system sales as customers shift to 3-D. Now turning to GYN surgical. Revenues of $72 million were down 2%. Strong double-digit worldwide growth in MyoSure and to a lesser extent international NovaSure sales growth helped offset a low-teens decline in domestic NovaSure sales. I will now review second quarter non-GAAP performance for the rest of the P&L. Gross margins were 62.5%, down 10 basis points from last year, but above our original annual guidance range of 61.5% to 62%. The strength in Q2 gross margins was due to higher than expected revenues and a favorable revenue mix from blood screening, domestic 3-D mammo and service. As we look at the second half of the year, we are comfortable we will be at the high end of our original annual range based on anticipated fluctuations in product and geographic mix. Operating expenses were $188 million, representing a decrease of 4% and our estimated annual tax rate remained at 34.5%. As a result of higher than forecasted revenues and margins, we generated earnings per share of $0.37, exceeding the high end of guidance we provided last quarter by $0.03. Before turning to the balance sheet, I will expand on a couple of decisions we made to streamline operations that resulted in charges during the quarter. As Steve mentioned, we are exiting some of our smaller businesses. As part of this effort, we are seeking a buyer for our MRI breast coils product line. Based on recent fair value estimates, we recorded a $29 million charge in our GAAP P&L, primarily related to intangible assets. This is an example of a business line divestiture that will help us focus our resources on more strategic and profitable areas of the company. We do not yet know the timing of this divestiture and will update you as appropriate. In addition, as part of our efforts to gain further efficiencies, we are closing our high-tech drum business in Germany and we consolidated certain assets into our newer Delaware facility. Consequently, we reduced headcount and plan to sell our facility in Germany. We recorded a small charge in our GAAP P&L associated with this plant closure in our second quarter. Despite these charges, we see these as positive developments in our plan to focus resources where they can have the greatest impact on our growth strategy. As we continue to make progress on these and similar initiatives, we will provide updates. We will also look at other small divestitures, depending on the valuations they can come in. Now turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with $490 million in cash, down $339 million since the end of fiscal 2013, primarily as a result of $563 million in dept payments we made since the beginning of our fiscal year, partially offset by various cash inflows. During the quarter, we successfully completed a refinancing of our term loan B resulting in an interest rate reduction of 50 basis point. As part of this transaction, we made a $25 million voluntary prepayment on this loan balance. We generated $69 million in operating cash flow during the quarter and $249 million year-to-date. Therefore, we still expect to generate $500 million to $525 million for the year. In addition, our return on invested capital on a trailing 12 month basis was 8.3%. For definitions and calculations of operating cash flow and ROIC, please refer to our supplementary PowerPoint presentation. We ended the quarter with total debt obligations of $4.3 billion and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.4 times. On the capital allocation front, deleveraging is our overarching priority. As I mentioned a moment ago, we voluntarily prepaid a small amount of debt related to the term loan B, and we will continue to apply excess cash to debt repayment. Lastly, we did not repurchase any shares during the second quarter under our share buyback program. I will now review our fiscal 2014 third quarter and full year non-GAAP guidance. As a reminder, our guidance is detailed in our supplementary PowerPoint presentation and assumes currency rates consistent with the averages during Q2 2014. It does not assume any share repurchases or divestitures. For the third quarter, we expect revenues in the range of $615 million to $625 million which are flat to 2% down year-over-year and we expect EPS in the range of $0.33 to $0.34. For the fiscal year, we are raising our revenue guidance range to $2.46 billion to $2.49 billion from our previous range of $2.425 billion to $2.475 billion to reflect higher than expected revenues to-date. We are also raising our EPS guidance range to a $1.37 to $1.40 from our previous guidance of $1.34 to $1.38. This new EPS range is also based on the stronger results to-date, tempered by slightly higher than anticipated spending in the second half. While we posted modestly better-than-expected results so far this year, we are still early in the stages of a turnaround and our guidance for the remainder of the year reflects that as well as the ongoing headwinds we face. We certainly aim to be better but feel this is a realistic outlook today. In summary, our second quarter results was return to growth and lay the groundwork for a stronger year than we anticipated at the outset of fiscal 2014. We look forward to demonstrating our ongoing commitment to organic growth and debt reduction in the coming quarter. With that I will turn the call back to Steve. Stephen MacMillan : Thanks, Glenn. Before we take questions, I would just like to reiterate that we are pleased to report results slightly ahead of expectations. The result of the quarter further demonstrate that we are winning in the marketplace and can continue to do so with the strong portfolio products we currently have. The JRC contract win and strong 3-D mammo results are evidence of that. Our strategic review has been completed and we are moving forward with a strong leadership team to optimize execution, drive new product development and capitalizing underpenetrated opportunities across the globe. We will be domestic small fringe assets but our focus is now squarely on organic growth and debt repayment. In the months ahead, I look forward to updating you on our progress and providing additional details on our vision for Hologic's future. With that, Greg, will you please open it up to questions? Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : Good afternoon, and congrats on the progress. I guess I want to ask about the earnings guidance. Given the revenue levels, it appears that operating margin will really have to come down in the second half and historically this has been a business where second half margin has been stronger than the first. So can you just shed a little light in terms of, is there increased spending associated with the back half of the year? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, Jason. I will take that one. To be quite candid, I think we cut a little bit too much coming into the year, and as I look to get the R&D organizations rebuilt and even some of our sales and marketing efforts, probably a little more spend in the second half than we had in the first. I will also tell you, it will be well-controlled and not set ourselves up of getting ahead of ourselves. But it really comes down, in my mind, we probably cut a little too deeply going into the fiscal year. Jayson Bedford : Okay. I will limit that to one. Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you. Operator : And next we will go to Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Doug Schenkel : Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. My first question is, could you just provide some thoughts on the expected impact of the approval by the FDA versus HPV test as a primary screen? I would think that it may present ultimately an opportunity for you on the Aptima side, but could present more challenges on the ThinPrep side. Could you just walk us through your thoughts there? Stephen MacMillan : Sure, Doug. I think long-term, you nailed it exactly. First off, I congratulate Roche for the work that they did to get that. In the short-term, on ThinPrep, we frankly don't see much impact. When you think about how well established the Pap test is, also in terms of co-testing and the guidelines and the conservative nature of the specialists involved here, we think this is going to take some significant time. Over years, will it start to have an impact, yes. In the coming quarters, probably don't expect much. Having said that, as part of giving a guidance, we want to be a little conservative just in case. We always plan to be conservative and hopefully be better off in that. Long-term, I think as we become a major player in the HPV space, it probably does create some opportunity for us as well and we like our growth there. But again, clearly Roche is going to be a can tremendous competitor there. It has the leg up on this particular chapter. Doug Schenkel : Okay, and one quick follow-up to Jason's question. I know he was focused on historical second half spending patterns and Steve you did talk about ramping some investment on the R&D side. That being said, the sequential drop off in sales and marketing spend was pretty material, pretty impressive. Is that an area where you would expect to spend more? Or do you think that we can see the type leverage we saw this quarter moving forward? Stephen MacMillan : Sure. Long-term, you are going to see leverage because a lot of that, the cuts and changes made, I think in some ways make us healthier, leaner and we certainly don't want to bounce back. You know I have always run lean organizations. We are going to keep that. Having said that, it is a pretty big drop, and I think just going into the year, we might have cut into a little bit of bone that you can survive with for the short-term, but I want to rebuild some of the bone, particularly as I would say in the sales and marketing and the R&D efforts, but on a going basis, we will be reallocating, certainly adding some G&A as we go forward. So there is probably a little bit of conservatism in the OpEx spending. We are at that very interesting stage right now, where I am thrilled with what the team delivered here. But we want to be careful not to get ahead of ourselves. We don't want to be getting too far ahead of ourselves and too excited but there are some very good things going on. Doug Schenkel : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you. Thanks, Doug. Operator : And next, we will go to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Obviously a lot of news around morcellation. I understand that you guys do not sell a laparoscopic device for MyoSure. Can you maybe just talk about the impact that you could potentially see in the business and do you need to manage this with physicians? Stephen MacMillan : Sure. Actually the great part is, the physicians get this and understand that probably the only thing we have in common with laparoscopic commercialization is the term, is that word. But as you well know, Tycho, it's a very different process. We operate completely differently from those systems. Once the press started to hit, if you recall, the Wall Street Journal is out and front of this, or New York Time, whatever, back in December, we have been really close to the physician community here and our MyoSure, what I would remind everybody, our MyoSure hysteroscopic tissue removal system, we basically moved away from the morcellation word and the physician community totally gets it. Our team has just added ACOG over the last few days. This is much more of a consumer media event, certainly concern on the other side. It should not have an impact on our business. Having said that, again you always want to be cautious and conservative and know that anytime there is dustups in the media these days, there is a chance for confusion among possible patients and some conservatism. So there could be a little bit of that. But overall, the physician response has been very good. And our sales force, this is where our surgical sales force is tremendously educated and it has been a wonderful resource for even some of the physicians that even get caught up in the media itself and want that reassurance or want that clarification. Tycho Peterson : And then, just switching over to some of the reinvestments you will be making. As we think about Gen-Probe and the pipeline there, are things like viral load assays and the radiant [ph] PCR technology still on track? Or are they being put on the back burner, as you evaluate other options? Stephen MacMillan : No, they are both front and center. The Panther platform is tremendous and it is going to be about building out, if you look at both of those as extensions off of Panther, one on the assay part and building out the menu, the other part is making Panther even better and more broadly usable. They are both, we see, key to our future there. It's a great asset to Gen-Probe what we got out there. Frankly, we are probably going to do the greatest job in the early days of integrating, but pulling that team together now and there are some great things out there. Operator : And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with ISI Group. Stephen MacMillan : Hi, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Hi, guys. How are you? Congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe just getting back to that guidance question? There are a number of moving parts in the quarter, right. So you obviously had a blood screening win and a couple of other folks mentioned you do have concerns on morcellation as with HPV. So I just want to make sure, what's sort of baked into the guidance? How much of the Japanese win do you have in the guidance and what kind of sensitivities do you have around either HPV or morcellation softening? Stephen MacMillan : Sure. Let me start with the JRC. The JRC, we see really kicking in, in August. So it will be a modest fourth quarter event, but really it's going to be much more about 2015 for that contract kicking in. On both ThinPrep, even NovaSure, and to some degree MyoSure, we are probably a little cautious right now. Again I want to make sure we get our sea legs. We have got a lot of change going on in the company. Luckily our field forces are really delivering right now. But some time, right at that stage right now, we are feeling going about some things but you never know what you don't know yet. Just making sure that we get back, given our history, wanting to really get back on a path where you guys can count on us quarter-after-quarter to deliver what we said. Vijay Kumar : Great. Thank you, guys. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Vijay. Operator : And next, we will go to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good afternoon. Stephen MacMillan : Hi, David. David Lewis : Hi, Steve. How are you? Stephen MacMillan : Great. David Lewis : Steve, I want to push you a little bit here on the strategy. It's really the same word but in two different areas which is, the word is incremental. So, when you talked about investments to reaccelerate growth, it sounds like you have these areas to reinvest, but it also sounds like you want to invest at a rate commensurate with sales. I am wondering, just given this transformation, why not take bigger action and invest faster now and accelerate that path to growth? And then in the same question, maybe this is more for Glenn of for yourself, same thing on tax credit. It sounds like the strategy is, let's redomicile IP, let's move manufacturing operations, which are incremental ways of lowering your tax rate. There are structural tax rate lowered. So in two areas of the strategic plan, there could be a faster way to get there and I am wondering why the decision was made to be more incremental than faster? Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Sure, great question. David, first on the incremental. Let me add an extra clarification. I picture our investments in R&D being at a probably significantly higher rate than necessarily sales growth and funding that out of probably some reductions in G&A and other areas. So effectively, what I think you will see is, we will be investing more in R&D than sales and marketing. Probably beyond an incremental basis, but offset from the G&A side. So could we be more aggressive? Possibly. We are also at that stage, bring in the new leaders, I want to make sure that we are smart about where we put those investments and I mean that we are in that interesting blend right now where I am signaling to the team, look, we think we can generate a lot more growth and we are looking at the ideas but we are not just a ramp it up. So what you are probably going to see is it will ramp up over time as the ideas bubble up and as the competencies bubble up. And I think if we see great opportunities, we will certainly look to invest more there. So we won't be held back but we will be smart about it. On the tax piece, I may go ahead and let Glenn jump in on this one. Glenn Muir : The tax rate is really reflective today of where we are as really a U.S. based company with primarily U.S. sales and U.S. operations. And it's our intention to take greater advantage of the international opportunity out there and to move some manufacturing and IP resources overseas to be closer to those customer markets. But that will take a little bit of time and those are the effort that will help to bring that tax rate down from being a primarily U.S. based tax rate today. Stephen MacMillan : David, if I add one other color or commentary as it relates to maybe dimensionalizing, say the R&D investments. Take our surgical business as an example. That's an area where we really have done very little on ongoing incremental innovation, improving our products, building out. We have basically a two product division. So as we challenge that team to come up with the third, fourth and fifth products, and then line extension everything like that, I am totally convinced we will build that capability over time and make those investments, but it's not like from second quarter to third quarter, ready to just turn on the stick. I think it's a little bit of what we even had with the extra strong profit here in the second quarter. It's one thing to talk about the R&D. It's another to make sure that we fund it appropriately over time. Hopefully that gives a little more granularity or color to that. Operator : (Operator Instructions). We will take our next from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Mike Matson : Thanks for getting me in. I guess I was just wondering on the strength of the 3-D mammography growth that you had. Do you think that the CPT code had an effect in the quarter? I know the dollar amounts not known yet, but just having your customers know that there is a code coming and that will help their ROI on buying one of these systems. Do you think that played into the strength at all? Stephen MacMillan : Mike, it probably didn't have a huge impact in the quarter in terms of actual booked revenues. I would say, it's having a huge impact on the field force morale and also the psyche in the buyers and I think it does give us confidence going forward that the known certainty that something's coming, even though we don't what the numbers are, is reassuring to the hospital customers that we start to feel that even more going forward. I think as we said last quarter, we were focusing the field not use that as an excuse to hold back and I think our team was really out there fighting despite not having it, and then we were holding the reimbursement team to really get this across the finish line. And I think they are delivering there as well. But I think it does bode reasonably well for the quarters ahead. Mike Matson : All right. That's all I have. Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Great. Thanks, Mike. Operator : And next we will move to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Stephen MacMillan : Sure. Isaac Ro : Thanks. I just want to ask about the cytology business. I think Glenn, in the prepared remarks had said it was 4%. I was wondering if you could put a little color on the U.S. versus ex-U.S. dynamic there from a growth standpoint? The reason I ask you is, just trying to get a sense of where we are in the process of digesting those wider intervals for ThinPrep. Where do you think we are in that process? Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Yes, Isaac, I can jump in on this one. I will tell you, the U.S. was down probably very high single digits and the international was about flattish. So we don't want to go into exact specifics but you are still seeing that hit in the U.S. market and we are assuming that continuing and hopefully that will start to slow but we are not ready to declare an inflection point in the slowdown yet. Glenn, did you want to add to that? Glenn Muir : No, that was basically it. We are seeing continued some softness on the U.S. side. I think we were kind of pleased it wasn't more than what it was. It seemed to hold out fairly well for the quarter. Isaac Ro : Got it. That makes sense. Thanks so much, guys. Stephen MacMillan : Great. Thank you, Isaac. Operator : And next we will go to Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Anthony Petrone : Thanks. One on mammography, maybe Stephen or Glenn. Can you maybe just comment on when the mammography business reaches an inflection point maybe with 3-D uptick offsets the 2-D declines? Stephen MacMillan : I think we are starting to see it. I think we really started to see it in this quarter, where we seeing, especially the U.S., an acceleration in that business. If you look globally, we posted 8% growth. Our U.S. growth was even a little bit better than that. Glenn Muir : Yes, I would add that almost one half of the mammo systems were 3-D. So that's a pretty impressive number that we built up to over this timeframe is to jump up that just about half now are 3-D tomo of all mammo units going out the door. Anthony Petrone : And then just a quick one. Is pricing stable there? Stephen MacMillan : At this point, yes. It may get a little rougher once other competitors come in to the U.S. marketplace. Operator : And our next question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie. Jon Groberg : Hi. Thanks a million for taking the questions. If I can, maybe just following up on some of the investments. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the evolution? I think Gen-Probe was investing a lot in R&D and had a focus on expanding internationally. I think that was the focus previously of Hologic as well. You said maybe you put the brakes on that and cut a little more deeply than perhaps you should have but can you maybe talk, is there anything materially different about how you are going about doing that than what the plan was before? Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Sure, and the question being R&D or international. I am sorry, Jon. Jon Groberg : I think a little bit of both. Again, to me it sounds like that was a strategy previously. Maybe it kind of got slowed down. I am just wondering if it's just about throwing dollars? Or if there is something more material about how you are thinking about doing it versus what the plan had been previously? Stephen MacMillan : Sure. So let me take the R&D piece first. Post the acquisition, we did cut pretty deeply into the R&D organization. I think now we are really looking at the assays that we want to develop as well as fusion and everything else that we want to bring to market. Sending the signals that we want to invest, we want to be thinking about the future, that our whole plan for organic growth really is R&D driven and very much of the model that Gen-Probe had executed so successfully. And frankly, that Hologic, back in the early 2000s had executed very, very well and built up the mammo business. So it's emulating those models of great investments in R&D, great R&D teams and a steady stream of our products. On the international front, I think, frankly, we probably had some starts and stops in terms of investments. At the end of the day, we are really looking at it very granularly now, by franchise, by country. Which franchises are we going to invest in, in which countries, looking at what are the reimbursement rates for each of those countries. I think getting very specific about where the opportunities are. We are not applying, what we call the peanut butter principal of just saying and let's go grow international. But we can look at our surgical business, country by country. Where are we not developed? Where we have opportunities? The same for the molecular diagnostic business and much as Gen-Probe was starting to look there, they were still in the very early innings of global expansion. So a lot of this is now a very strong focus. Bringing Claus Egstrand in. I can tell you, he is two and half weeks into the job right now and already have been seeing a lot of opportunity. Again, those opportunities won't happen necessarily in the next quarter, but they will happen here in the coming years. Jon Groberg : Great, and that's very helpful. That's what I was going to get at in my next question. Just to be clear, do you think we should start seeing proof of the success within one year, two years? I am just curious what you think the timeframe is? Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Sure. I think on the international expansion, you ought to start to see that within a year-ish. Some markets like Japan will be a little slower but I think it's very clear that we ought to start to see certainly topline growth. Maybe not a lot of bottomline because we will be making the investments in those businesses. On the R&D front, reaccelerating and everything else, as we talk with our Board, it's probably a couple of years away before we really start to see the fruits of what we start to put in now. But what we have also said is, luckily we have a couple of great franchises with Panther and the 3-D tomo that can help drive a lot of growth here over the next couple of years while we reinvest in the R&D for the out years. Operator : And next we will hear from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Matt Larew : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. This is Matt, in for Brian Weinstein. Just in light of the recent JRC win here, just wondering, are there other large tender opportunities coming up in the near future? And you mentioned that Japan certainly was very focused on the technology evaluation. Just your thoughts on whether others are more cost or technology focused? Any comments there would be helpful. Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Sure, there is certainly nothing of the magnitude of the JRC coming up. There are some tenders going around Europe, Middle East and frankly it's a great question, you asked around technology versus pricing. We probably worry a little bit some of them maybe a little more price driven than what we are seeing. I think what we loved about Japan is everybody probably well knows that the quality concerns in Japan are always at the top of the list and we prevailed very well there. Where it's a pricing game, we are certainly seeing some aggressiveness in the competitive set to try to hold on to business and that puts some certain pressure on that business as well. Matt Larew : Thanks for taking the questions, Steve. Stephen MacMillan : Sure. Thank you, Matt Operator : And next we will hear from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Richard Newitter : Hi, thanks for squeezing me in, guys. Steve, as you say that you think you are nearing an inflection point in 3-D tomo adoption, potentially in U.S., can you talk a little bit about the strategy and the progress you may be making with conversations individually with individual insurers? And then also, what can we expect in terms of the timing and the process, once you do get more clarity around final amounts on the CPT code? And how should we think about that actually translating into actual coverage from a timing and what your strategy is to work with insurers to get that materialized? Stephen MacMillan : Sure. I think pragmatically the insurer piece won't play out until well into 2015. I think everybody is going to be fairly cautious and that's where we are at such an interesting time in the company right now, where there is some nice nuggets here that look good, but we want to be cautious and not get ahead of ourselves. So between, let's say the CPT will come out in November, it will kick in January. By the time you get the local, between the Medicare pieces, and then also private payers adopting, it's probably going to be rolling out really through 2015. But I think what it does do is, as the clinical evidence of 3-D mammography and as more word gets out about just the superiority of what we have, I can tell you, there is not one of us on this call whose wives, mothers, daughters, whatever, who wouldn't want to have 3-D. And I think as the consumer awareness also builds in this very important area, that should bode well. So I think the way I would really thinking though about the 3-D businesses, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's not think there is huge spike here, but I think we should think about it as it should be a really nice run here for a number of years, given where we are. Thanks, Richard. Operator : And next we will hear from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Bill Quirk : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. A quick one for me. Just coming back to morcellation. I realize that, it sounds like anyway, that you have perhaps dialed back some of your expectations for MyoSure. But with one of your main competitors off the market, any chance that we could actually see that be a source of upside over the balance of the year and also as we think about 2015? Stephen MacMillan : No, you know what, because it really gets back to, we do not compete against the J&J piece. For the same reason we shouldn't be affected. Unfortunately, it's a great question. You would like to think we could go get that business, but for the same reason, we are unaffected because we are used in a completely different procedure. We are not indicated nor would we be able to go in and effectively try to get that business. You can bet, it was one of the fist things, as I am still learning our products but I jumped on thinking, okay, we don't have a problem, where is the opportunity. Unfortunately, we don't. Bill Quirk : Okay, no, fair enough, and then just a follow-up on the blood screening question. Any update, guys, on China? Obviously they have been incrementally moving towards using NAT. I know there's a handful of folks involved here, but just a general update there would be great. Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Sure. You know what, we don't really have an update there other than we are going through the process. So I don't have anything more for you, Bill. Bill Quirk : Okay. Thanks, Steve. Operator : And next is Jon Block from Stifel. Jon Block : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one, numbers were certainly strong across the board, but one thing that stood out to me was breast health internationally. If I look at constant currency, down almost 4% year over year. Maybe if you can just give us some color, I am surprised it was down mid-single digits in light of the product cycle internationally. Can you talk about the capital environment overseas? And then specific to GE, anything different in the competitive landscape now that they have been out there with their tomo offering for a couple of quarters? Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Sure. Great insight. I would say that the international breast piece was more an anomaly, some very big sales that happened in the previous year, especially in the Middle East and frankly some of the emerging markets. So I think what we have had as I dig in and it's where I want to careful and I want to start to get to a more regular cadence. We have had some real huge variations in geographic swings in the breast health business. To me that, I like to see be smoother over time. So I think it's less a trend. Clearly, with the competitive set out there Philips, GE, Siemens, even Fuji, it is a more competitive world outside the U.S. I think this is probably a slightly unusually softer quarter due to the comps of last years. Jon Block : Okay, perfect. Then just a quick follow-up. Glenn, this might be more for you. On the initiatives around tax planning, when could we possibly see that come into play? Is that 2015, or think further out? And then as part of that, could you arguably see some inefficiencies on the manufacturing as a result as we get there? Thanks, guys. Glenn Muir : Jon, on the tax timing, we are talking further out than FY 2015. We have to begin to set up some of that manufacturing IP transfer now. It needs to be tied into where we are doing business for some of the emerging markets. So there is a lot of planning that's involved. I don't think it has to necessarily have an impact on the efficiencies of our manufacturing and we do some nice manufacturing outside the U.S. now. Costa Rica is a great example. In fact some of the margin improvement is because we have moved many of our disposal products down to Costa Rica. So I think there is some opportunities there. We guess now are at a better size and scale to be able to take advantage of some of these international opportunities. But they are more than a couple of years out, Jon. Stephen MacMillan : There is real structural work that needs to happen. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Next we will hear from Bill Bonello with Craig Hallum. Bill Bonello : Thank you very much. Can you just talk a little bit about your plans for a couple of the businesses where you have been seeing declines for a while now, the domestic ThinPrep and NovaSure? How are you thinking about investment in those businesses? Could we just have to accept that they kind of at a steady decline or are there things you believe you can do to reverse that trend at all? Stephen MacMillan : Great question. On a macro basis, I think ThinPrep with the extensions of the interval expansions, there is just going to be unit losses there that no matter what we do from a selling standpoint or anything else. We are thinking about R&D. Are there ways that we could inject some different life into a franchise like that. NovaSure, the same thing and our sales forces are still out there fighting. So part of our strategy to return to organic growth and we are talking about internally is, if we can even slow the rate of decline, particularly those two key franchises, which by the way are also great gross margin franchises, even on the margin, if we can use to slow the declines, I am not sure I would be ready to say we can turn them around in the U.S. I would say, it's back to the also our global footprint and both franchises are underdeveloped internationally. ThinPrep is a little bit more established but there are significant opportunities, we really think, for both franchises outside the U.S. and I think, again, we have been subject to the bigger headwinds of U.S. reimbursement that were U.S. issues because we have been way too dependent on the U.S. market and so part of our diversification and insulation from some of those trends will be to build these franchises outside the U.S. Operator : And next we will move to Jeff Relic with Canaccord. Jeff Relic : Good afternoon, folks. Steve, where do you think you are on Panther consumable yields? What I am asking is, like what kind of percent of your target yields are you at now given the Quest business is starting to ramp? Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : You know what, Jeff? I honestly don't know the answer to that yet. We will have to get back to you on that. There's still a few parts of the business I am not 100% in detail. Glenn? Glenn Muir : Yes, we have been making good progress on the Panther. A big chunk of the Panther's have gone out in the last six to nine months. So that is now ramping up. But just to clarify, Quest is not Panther. Quest is Tigris. So what we have been able to do with Quest is they did order quite a few Tigris' at the end of last fiscal year. Those are now in place and those are now up and running. And you are seeing the benefit on the CPG side. You are seeing the benefit on the HPV side. And now on the Trich side from Quest. Jeff Relic : Okay, thanks, Glenn. Glenn Muir : There is a lot more room on the Panther side. It is all about getting Panthers out there. We are ahead of our schedule to get 1,000 Panthers in the field by the end of FY 2015. We feel good about that. Once we have that, it's then expanding the menu and Steve talked about that. So I think we are in a good position with that product. People love the Panther. It's a great piece of automation and workflow. Operator : And our last question today comes from John Zecy with MorningStar. John Zecy : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick question on the diagnostic pipeline. If you could maybe just talk a little bit more about the opportunity in viral load testing? I am just trying to get a sense of how the pipeline is going to evolve and sort of your plans for rolling that out and how that might potentially offset some of the ThinPrep softness? Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Sure. We clearly have articulated, that is an area we are developing. That will still be a little bit, particularly in the United States market, that's going to be years away. But we are developing those assays and do expect to be there. Nothing, again, that's certainly further out in terms of timeframe at this point. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's second quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call. Have a good evening.",

Groberg - Macquarie Research Operator : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Hologic, Inc. Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call. My name is Jamie, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Deborah R. Gordon: Thank you, Jamie. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will consist of opening remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. The replay of this call will be archived on our website through Wednesday, August 20, and a copy of our third quarter release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Also in that section is a supplemental third quarter financial presentation related to the comments that will be made during today's opening remarks. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call may be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can also be found in our third quarter earnings release. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan. Stephen P. MacMillan: Thank you, Deb, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Before we begin, I'm excited to welcome Bob McMahon, our new CFO, to his first Hologic earnings call. As many of you know, Bob joined the Hologic team during the quarter from Johnson & Johnson. Bob's strong operational and leadership skills are already evident, and we know Bob will have a big impact on our performance and direction in the quarters and years ahead. On today's call, I will : one, review our third quarter results and recent developments; two, give an update on leadership changes; and three, discuss key business highlights, particularly the landmark JAMA publication that came out last month. I'd like to begin by providing some context for where Hologic is today. After steep sales and earnings declines early in the year, we had indicated we hoped to stabilize the business by the end of the year and pave the way for a return to growth in 2015. Our fiscal 2014 results to date now offer a more definitive sign that we have stopped the declines and are returning to growth a little faster than expected. While the absolute growth rate is not the level we aspire to, this was a second straight quarter of sales growth as our turnaround is clearly taking hold. The reported overall sales growth was slightly below last quarter's rate, though this quarter was qualitatively stronger as our Breast Health, Molecular Diagnostics and even our Surgical businesses all grew. Our higher-margin U.S. businesses accelerated, and the outlook for our key U.S. Breast Imaging business strengthened considerably. These results clearly demonstrate improving growth trends with our key franchises strengthening and our financial outlook improving. In addition to the results which we'll discuss further, we put a completely new leadership team in place during the quarter, a new CFO, new Chief Operating Officer, new Head of International and a new President of Breast and Skeletal Health. All 4 leaders have outstanding track records at blue-chip companies. I am incredibly energized at what this team will bring to the company. We mentioned Eric Compton, our COO; and Claus Egstrand, our Head of International on the last call. I'll now touch on the 2 most recent additions. Bob, our new CFO, joined us after more than 20 years with Johnson & Johnson, most recently as worldwide Vice President of Finance and Business Development for the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Group, bringing with him significant experience in the healthcare industry. While at J&J, Bob held a number of senior financial positions of increasing responsibility and demonstrated strong leadership capabilities. I am fully confident that Bob will bring a new level of leadership to our finance team and to the company, and I'm already seeing it. Also during the quarter, Pete Valenti joined us as Division President, Breast and Skeletal Health. Pete has a successful track record of driving strong sales performance throughout his nearly 30-year career with Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Covidien and Bausch + Lomb . Pete will play an important role in building on the strength we are already seeing in our 3D mammography franchise where his expertise in marketing will surely be of great value to the company. The additions of Bob and Pete round out our new management team, with each executive possessing strong leadership skills and experience on a global scale. We now have a strong team in place to instill operational excellence and continue to drive the company's turnaround as we work towards our goals of delivering sustainable organic growth and maximizing shareholder value. Now, let me briefly review our fiscal third quarter results that underscore the progress we are making. Revenues were $633 million, up 1% from last year and represent the second consecutive quarter of growth. In fact, overall revenues grew despite a small international decline of 2% as we took measures to institute financial discipline throughout our organization, which I will expand upon in a moment. Revenues in the U.S. grew 2%. Globally, 3 of our 4 franchises, Breast Health, Surgical and Skeletal, delivered growth during the quarter. Although modest, we are especially pleased to see surgical return to growth for the first time in many quarters. MyoSure continues to represent a strong growth story, while the NovaSure decline started to slow. While overall diagnostics experienced a decline, the decline was smaller than what we saw on the first 2 quarters of the year. In fact, our U.S. Diagnostics business improved, primarily as a result of our molecular diagnostics business, posting high-single digit growth in the U.S. and low single-digit growth internationally. Overall, the key contributors to our growth in the quarter were 3D mammography system sales, service revenues associated with our large and growing installed base of digital mammography systems, strength within our Molecular Diagnostics business lines and a resurgence in our surgical franchise. From a geographic standpoint, virtually all of our growth in the quarter came from the U.S. while international revenues were down. However, it's important to understand that some of the international softness is due to our commitment to break from past habits and exercise pricing discipline throughout the quarter in all geographies. We believe this would yield downstream benefits since there is genuine demand for our products in these markets. Without a doubt, some of our greatest growth opportunities are in untapped foreign markets, and we expect to take advantage of these opportunities as we further establish our global infrastructure. During the quarter, perhaps the most significant development that will play into our future growth was the publication of the largest clinical study to date using Hologic's 3D mammography technology. This study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association or JAMA, was conducted at 13 leading academic and clinical sites in the United States and involved more than 450,000 exams. Among the important findings of this study were : one, a 41% increase in the detection of invasive cancers, those which are most important to find and find early; two, a 29% increase in detection of all cancers; three, a 15% reduction in recalls for additional imaging; and four, no significant change in the detection of ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS, which is cancer that has not spread beyond the milk duct, and therefore, may not need to be treated as aggressively as invasive breast cancer. The significance of this study cannot be understated. For the first time, on a large-scale basis, we have data clearly demonstrating that our 3D mammography and only ours, uniquely increases the detection of invasive breast cancers, which are cancers most important to identify and treat early while not increasing detection of low-grade cancers that some have suggested are overdiagnosed or overtreated. These results address the most frequently cited concerns with breast cancer screening and underscore the value of our 3D technology in addressing these challenges. We believe the JAMA study confirms what several other studies have shown so far, that 3D mammography facilitates the early detection of invasive cancer, lowers the rate of callbacks with unnecessary testing and creates meaningful savings to the healthcare system. With regard to reimbursement, we are awaiting publication of new CPT codes for 3D mammography and their associated rates this fall. We realize there are a number of moving parts here as the existing G-codes for digital are migrated to CPT codes and the entire reimbursement framework is reevaluated by CMS. At this point, we will have to see where things fall out, but we are optimistic the final outcome will be helpful to our 3D commercialization efforts. Our Diagnostics franchise is showing signs of strengthening as we work to return this business to growth. The key driver of that strength is our molecular diagnostics business where we are having nice success growing our HPV franchise, ramping up our business at Quest and increasing revenue pull through from Panther placements. Looking ahead, we also see a significant opportunity for accelerating growth in international markets in the years ahead. Also on the international front, implementation of Grifols' multi-year contract with the Japanese Red Cross should help offset anticipated weakness in U.S. blood donation volumes. Despite the well-known headwinds facing our Cytology business, we are now seeing reasonable progress in our Diagnostics franchise. As noted earlier, our surgical business returned to growth in the quarter, as domestic NovaSure declines slowed and were more than offset by the combined o U.S. growth in NovaSure and strong double-digit MyoSure growth worldwide. Although the quarter is only one data point, we are optimistic this business is turning the corner. Before turning the call over to Bob for a more detailed financial discussion, I would like to review our progress and outlook. Our focus on driving organic growth is beginning to yield positive results and validates the recent organizational and operational changes we have made. Despite the ongoing headwinds facing the company, we are more confident in our outlook based on the consistent improvement we've been able to deliver thus far in fiscal 2014, and especially in the third quarter. We have shown an ability to stem some of the declines in the challenged areas of our business, while accelerating growth in areas of key strengths such as 3D mammography and Molecular Diagnostics. We now have a talented and experienced leadership team in place that will build on this momentum. As Bob will detail shortly, we are raising our guidance for the year to reflect our improved performance and growing confidence in the outlook. With that, I will now turn the call over to Bob. Robert W. McMahon: Thank you, Steve. I am excited to be part of the new Hologic leadership team at a time of tremendous opportunity for the company. I look forward to partnering with Steve and the rest of the senior management team to support the efforts already underway to drive growth and capitalize on new opportunities and deliver improved operating and financial results. I also look forward to building relationships with our investors and the analyst community in the coming months. Our third quarter results are a signal that the turnaround of the company is taking place, but we realize there is more work ahead of us. With that, I will now review our third quarter financial results in more detail. Unless otherwise noted, all of my commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year non-GAAP basis. As Steve mentioned, third quarter revenues were $633 million, up 1% on a reported basis compared to the prior year of $626 million and up 0.5% operationally. These results exceeded our guidance range of $615 million to $625 million for the quarter. Now moving on to our results by division, starting with Diagnostics. Revenues of $293 million in this division declined 1.5% in the third quarter. Drilling down into the Diagnostics major business lines. Revenues in our cytology and perinatal business declined 7% to $123 million. International revenues were down 3%, while U.S. revenues declined 9%, primarily as a result of lower U.S. sales of ThinPrep due to ongoing screening interval expansion, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in average selling prices based on customer mix. We had a good quarter on our Molecular Diagnostics business, which increased 7% to $116 million, driven by growth in the U.S. Our core Aptima franchise experienced healthy growth in the high-teens, primarily due to continued uptake at Quest and the broader adoption of Aptima HPV. This growth in Aptima HPV sales was complemented by high-single digit growth in CT/GC and strong growth in our Trichomonas assay. Blood screening revenues of $54 million declined 4%, primarily due to the timing of contingent revenue from our collaboration with Grifols. We are encouraged by the Japanese Red Cross and other wins, which are expanding our long-term opportunities in international markets and expect to see this impact primarily in 2015. From an instrument placement standpoint, we had another strong quarter with Panther and are on track to place 1,000 instruments by the end of fiscal 2015. Now moving on to Breast Health. Revenues increased 3.5% to $238 million, driven primarily by strong growth in 3D mammography system sales in the U.S. and we are on track to meet our goal of installing at least 500 3D mammography systems in the U.S. this year. Partially offsetting this increase was the anticipated decline of 2D mammography system sales as customers shift to 3D. In addition, as Steve mentioned, we focused on exercising some pricing discipline during the end of the quarter. And as a result, our international business experienced a decline. Service revenue was again a key contributor, and we achieved 8.5% growth in this business, driven by our growing installed base of digital mammography systems. Now turning to our GYN Surgical business. Revenues were up 3.5% to $78.5 million. Strong double-digit growth in our MyoSure franchise globally and double-digit growth of NovaSure internationally helped offset a high-single digit decline in domestic NovaSure sales. And finally, our Skeletal Health business grew 0.9% to $23 million. Now moving on to our third quarter performance for the rest of the P&L. Gross margins were 62.9%, up 50 basis points from last year and above our annual guidance range of approximately 62%. The strength in the third quarter gross margins was due to a variety of factors, including higher-than-expected revenues, favorable product mix and favorable geographic mix. Also during the quarter, we benefited from favorable manufacturing variances in our Diagnostics business due to an increase in inventory, driven by a system cutover earlier in the year, as well as volume increases. These manufacturing variances contributed approximately 75 basis points to the company's gross margins in the quarter. Operating expenses were $198 million, representing a 7% increase versus the prior year. And during the quarter, we have a slight increase in our estimated annual effective tax rate from 34.5% to 34.75%. This is primarily a result of some unbenefited losses associated with some of our smaller businesses we are looking to exit. As you know, lowering our effective tax rate was one of the biggest initiatives to come out of the strategic review process earlier in the year, and we are still developing a long-term plan. Despite this slightly higher tax rate, we achieved earnings per share of $0.37, which, while down 3% from last year's third quarter EPS of 38%, exceeded the high end of our guidance by 3%, driven by a higher-than-forecasted revenues and gross margins. Now turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with $638 million in cash. Our operating cash flow was $158 million for the quarter, and we have generated approximately $400 million year-to-date, leaving us on pace to generate $500 million to $525 million for the year, as previously discussed. We also continue to focus on paying down our debt, and year-to-date, we have paid down $579 million in principal payments. We've improved our net debt to EBITDA ratio to 4.2x as compared to 4.4x at the end of Q2, and we ended the quarter with total debt obligations of $4.3 billion. On the capital allocation front, deleveraging is our top priority, and we did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter under our share buyback authorization. I will now review our non-GAAP guidance, which, as a reminder, is detailed in our supplementary PowerPoint presentation and assumes currency rates consistent with the averages during the third quarter. Before providing our fourth quarter guidance, I'll first detail a one-time revenue item that will benefit our results over and above our ongoing business performance. We have entered into an amended license agreement with Roka Bioscience. As part of the amended agreement, Roka has exercised an option to reduce their future royalty obligations, and as a result, Hologic will receive approximately $20 million in cash and common stock in the fourth quarter. This will be reflected as an addition to our revenue for the quarter and fiscal year and will result in an incremental $0.05 in EPS. However, my guidance commentary will exclude this one-time benefit and I will speak in terms of the expected results of our ongoing business. With that said, for the fiscal fourth quarter, we expect revenues in the range of $630 million to $640 million. We also expect to achieve EPS in the range of $0.36 to $0.37, mainly driven by higher forecasted revenues and an increase in our gross margin percentage to approximately 63%. Again, this excludes the one-time benefit of $20 million in revenue and associated $0.05 in EPS related to the amended license agreements. Based upon our performance to date and improved outlook for the fourth quarter, we are raising our full fiscal year revenue guidance to $2.50 billion to $2.51 billion, up from our previous range of $2.46 billion to $2.49 billion. We are also raising our fiscal year EPS guidance range to $1.44 to $1.45, up from our previous range of $1.37 to $1.40. Again, this excludes the one-time benefit of $0.05 associated with the amended license agreement. Before turning the call back over to Steve, I would like to reiterate how excited I am to be a part of the Hologic team, and I look forward to contributing to the turnaround that is taking place. Our goal is to deliver organic growth with strong profitability and cash generation. We will be focused on delevering the company and improving our operating flexibility while employing a more disciplined approach to capital allocation in the future. With that, I will turn the call back over to Steve. Stephen P. MacMillan: Thanks, Bob. Before we take questions, I would like to remind everyone of our priorities and commitments. First and foremost, we are focused on driving sustainable organic growth across all of our businesses, and believe we are already seeing signs of progress on this front. We're committed to reinvigorating our innovation engine and establishing a strong global infrastructure, which will require time and investment, but should yield significant benefits for the company in the long term. We are committed to paying down our debt obligations and restoring the company's financial flexibility while generating the sizable cash flows we have historically realized. We believe focusing on these priorities places us in the best position to drive improved performance and maximize shareholder value. This is a company with some truly breakthrough products, and we are on the path to improve performance. With that, Jamie, please open the call up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Two questions, 1 strategic and 1 very specific on the numbers. Steve or Bob, you talked about the growth of mammo in the business the last 2 quarters, that's been very clear. Can you just walk me through the fourth quarter number? Because the implied guidance for the fourth quarter implied a break in that momentum, as I'm sure you're aware last quarter or last year this time, was your easiest comparable. So on a comparable adjusted basis, it implies fourth quarter as sort of decelerating. Is that just conservatism or is there something specific to the fourth quarter? And I have a follow-up for Bob as well. Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. I think as you pointed out, David, we are going up against our easiest comp in the fourth quarter. So our reported growth will actually be a little bit better than it was in the last 2 quarters versus year ago. We're still being -- I would say, as we're shifting our guidance, I wouldn't want to signal that I'd say we're going from more conservative to more realistic guidance. We had 2 pretty big beats, but I think we feel pretty good still about the direction, but haven't sat through all the ups and downs and been through the full year cycle here yet to get overly ahead of ourselves on the revenue front. But I think we're feeling reasonably good about where it's headed. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And then, Bob, maybe, if you could indulge us. We've had multiple CEO changes here over the last several years at Hologic, but we haven't had a CFO change in decades. So maybe if you could share with us your perspective from a financial point of view on what are the interesting opportunities as you've gone from a larger organization to a rather small one? What are the opportunities? What do you see short-term? What can you achieve short-term? What do you see long-term? Any help would be very much appreciated. Stephen P. MacMillan: David, before he answers that, I'd like to jump in and say one of his goals is to prevent the frequency of CEO changes. So with that, Bob will take over here. Robert W. McMahon: It's a good question. You had a number of questions in there and maybe I'll take it in a couple of areas. When I think about what are some of the focus areas that I'm going to be looking at, both short-term and long-term, I'll really speak to kind of 3 areas. And first and foremost, as Steve talked about, what we want to do with this company. I'm really going to be focused on helping improve the operational execution of the business. This is going to be including working with some of the new leadership, as he mentioned, in our divisions, to increase the profitability and helping drive better performance by instilling some of that financial discipline. I think there's real opportunity there, both in the short term and also in the long term. I also think that we need to be focused on a much more disciplined approach to capital allocation. We want to leverage those strong operating cash flows to pay down the debt. We are improving our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. But as you, I'm sure, know, we're highly leveraged relative to our peers and we want to increase our operating flexibility going forward. As part of that, one of the things that we are going to be looking at more concretely is ROIC. We have been publishing that. That's a metric that I think is a really important metric for this company. And I think by increasing that, that really creates shareholder value, leads to shareholder value. Our current is 8.3, and I think that's something, longer term, I'm going to really be focused on improving that over time. And then finally, I spoke to it a little bit, our opportunity around optimizing our tax position. Again, I think that's one of the key opportunities. I think that's something that we're looking at over time. We haven't had a tax planning in the organization of any significance, and we're a primarily U.S. based company, but longer term, with the growth opportunities that we have in international, we think that we'll be able to have a nice dovetail there between our tax strategy and our growth strategies to lower that tax rate over time. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Steve, maybe if you could spend a minute talking a little bit about how you guys are driving the x U.S. growth. And trying to get a sense of the infrastructure you put in place beyond the new leadership team and just some of the ways in which you could help us stay comfortable that this pace of improvement is sustainable? Stephen P. MacMillan: I would say that the truth is, we're still on probably the top of the first inning, we're probably in the batter's box. Claus Egstrand Just started midway through the last quarter and if I'm candid with you, part of what he's going to do is rip a few things apart before he rebuilds and puts it all back together again. So I think he's been assessing the situation, sees clear opportunities to focus in specific geographies and specific franchises, and is really taking a franchise-based approach and a country-based approach to the efforts. And that's going to really start to build the infrastructure candidly this quarter, and really, next quarter. So I think it's going to be a build over time, as we look at it. But to underscore the opportunities, we are delivering nice growth in Europe. We did bring in a new head of our European business last year, and she's been doing a heck of a job driving that business. So I think that will be generating the shorter term growth, while he really then refocuses on Asia. And while everybody focuses a lot on China, we specifically have huge opportunities even in Japan. So big opportunities for us ahead. And I think what you'll see is, this is going to be a multi-year journey. Much like our tax strategy, a lot of what we're looking at is it's going to take a little bit of time as we build the right people and get everything in place. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : That's helpful. And just maybe one follow-up, obligatory question on the overall volume environment, specifically the Surgical business. I'm just wondering how much in the environment, I mean, improvement, rather, you might attribute to things like weather, ACA versus underlying trend, versus share? It seems like to me, it's really more company-specific, but I'm curious about your views on the overall environment. Stephen P. MacMillan: Any time we have an uptick, probably always my first default is to credit the external events. I think that did it. I would tell you though, I think our sales force in that division has really settled down. If you look back, go back to third quarter, fourth quarter, call it our fourth fiscal quarter last year and even our first fiscal quarter of this year, that surgical division was thinking it might be sold off, turnover was incredibly high. That team has really hunkered down and refocused on executing and I'm just incredibly proud of the leadership and at all levels of that organization and how they've really settled that team down and refocused on the customers. And we saw very nice continued progress in MyoSure and even the NovaSure declines starting to slow. And I think it's just a blocking and tackling of those extra sales calls every day and reenergized team there. So that's probably one of the ones we're most proud of. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : You did a good job paying down a significant amount of debt so far this fiscal year, but I was wondering if you could tell us what sort of level you're comfortable with, I guess, on a leverage ratio perspective. And then what level of debt would you consider allocating some of your cash flow back to shareholders, either with buybacks or dividends? Robert W. McMahon: Yes, Mike this is Bob, I'll take that. And so as I mentioned, currently, were at 4.2x. I would tell you that's too high. I think we've mentioned getting back into a more normalized and that would probably be in the 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio we've put out there. We think we can get there by fiscal year '17, and I think that, that makes sense. And I think until we do that and pay down, it's probably premature to talk about how we would distribute excess cash, but that will be something that we will be taking on over time. Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : And then just a question on the JAMA study. I'm just wondering, obviously got a lot of headlines. Do you view this as something that's more important in the clinical community, more important in the patient community or equally important in both areas? Because I know some of this data has sort of been out there in various forms, maybe not quite as visible though. Stephen P. MacMillan: Great question, Mike. I think, really, both. There's still been the naysayers within the hospital purchasing community that have been able to kind of throw back. Well, we don't have any big studies, you got Oslo, you got Scottie, you got Rose, some little things here and there. I think we immediately are starting to see more interest, certainly from both the hospital community. And again, as you well know, because you're very familiar with capital purchase cycles, it's not like this quarter, sales are going to have this huge inflection point, but I think the momentum driving it is very good. The other piece that we literally saw that day was hospitals who were suddenly getting calls from patients starting to demand it. And I'd tell you one anecdote, we had some folks at a hospital I won't say, that had been very reticent and really was kind of going through the motions, I think, humoring our team and one more time. The meeting started at 10 a.m. that day and somebody came into the meeting and said they'd already gotten 6 calls from patients that morning, asking if that hospital had Hologic 3D mammo. So it clearly made for a better sales call than we otherwise would have expected. So I think it's both the patient awareness and I think we can do even more on that. The other anecdote in all of this is actually the OB/GYN community where we should be doing a better job of really educating that audience. We've been so focused on radiologists and the traditional users but as you know, we've got very nice sales forces calling on OB/GYNs. And a lot of the OB/GYNs hadn't really been very familiar with. So it's also something that we can leverage there. Again, given the size of that audience, that will take some time, but a study that's published in JAMA certainly has a lot of credibility with that audience as well. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Richard Newitter with Leerink. Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Steve, kind of just piggybacking off of that, can you talk a little bit about the capital equipment spend environment? Obviously, you're in a unique position, you have a differentiated technology to perhaps push you over the edge on some levels, but are you noticing any changes in the tone or the conversations with the administrators, their willingness to kind of prioritize capital? Can you comment there? Stephen P. MacMillan: Not seeing any meaningful difference. It's clearly not the late '08, early '09 time period, so it's open up, but it's still fairly rigorous. I would say, I think in general, we're competing against a lot of healthcare IT in terms of capital investments coming from the hospitals. So we've really got to make our cases. And I think even our own sales team in that Breast Imaging business is getting better at making the economic arguments in addition to just the technical features and benefits of the products. So it's still a slog in some, the process has gotten a lot more layered, shall we say, in terms of the number of sign offs within an institution, but nothing meaningfully different, say, today versus, I'd say, even a year ago. Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Great. And then just follow-up also on tomo. You mentioned that you're optimistic that the CPT code decision and the rates that are set will be helpful to your commercialization process in January of next year and going forward. Can you give us a sense of, are hospitals more concerned right now with perhaps not buying just because they don't want to be in front of that given uncertainty? What are the rates going to be? How is the paradigm of reimbursement for the whole 2D, 3D process going to change? Or is it the other way, are you noticing a pickup in discussions and willingness, and they want to get ahead of the CPT code that they know is coming one way or the other? Stephen P. MacMillan: It's probably a little more of the former, though it's a combination of both. I think the lack of differentiation is a simple smokescreen and a simple objection that can be put up there. Frankly, given the incredible differentiation of this product, even we're challenging our sales teams, and a lot of our sales teams that have been selling it, are selling through that objection. I do think knowing there's something coming is helping get people a little more comfortable. And I think that extra certainty will be a nice additional, call it, accelerator to the curve. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel. Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Maybe first one, Steve, for you. On the international breast side, I asked last quarter, I think the business was down last quarter, and you pointed to a tough comp. But down again this quarter, and you mentioned pricing environment. So can you talk to maybe, the landscape over there? It's a different one from a competitive standpoint from what you're seeing from a pricing environment because I think when you mentioned pricing internationally, that was specific to Breast Health. Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. Very good question, Jon. I'd put it this way. We largely deal with the dealer network outside the U.S., and candidly, when you look at the performance of the company over time, I think we had developed a habit of allowing deep discounts at quarter end to get some extra revenue across the finish line. And we're in the process right now of saying, you know what, we're not going to do those deals. I think Bob has come in and my new team exerting a very different level of financial discipline that we're going to be willing to walk away from some deals that I think will come over time, but it's probably -- if you look, dare I say, we're never going to get into monthly reporting, but if you look at the months within the quarter, very different in the last month, dare I say, the last weeks of the quarter. And so I feel very good about where we will be going there. Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, great. And maybe just a quick follow-up on surgical. Anything specific? I mean, I don't believe there was sort of an iteration for the NovaSure product line. Was it when you alluded to the guys hunkering down, has some of the dust settled from Affordable Care Act and what's free from sort of an IUD standpoint? And I guess where I'm going with this is, do you think that the worst is behind you and even though you might be fighting negative growth on NovaSure, we can see some stability going forward? Stephen P. MacMillan: I do think the worst is behind us. We're clearly probably getting a little bit of a pop from the ACA, but that's cut both ways because IUDs are now covered. I really think this one is largely is coming down the sales execution, and being reminded that we've got 2 great products in the bag. And I think to some degree, there was probably a bit of infatuation with MyoSure, and we just kind of took our eye off the ball a little bit with NovaSure. And now, the team, I think, has really hunkered back down and realizing if we can just slow the declines on NovaSure, that also helps get them a lot of closer to hitting their quotas and really helps both. So I think that the leadership team there has really reengaged and refocused the team on remembering what a great product NovaSure still is, even if it's facing some general declines. So I think we'll still see some declines there in the U.S., but the rate of them seem to come down and then we're really trying to ramp up those businesses outside the U.S. Operator : And we'll go next to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Maybe a follow-up to Jon's first question there, just on pricing. In general, it seems like there's a broader strategy here to extract more price where you can. So maybe can you just comment beyond mammography, and where you see additional opportunities to extract price within the portfolio and maybe by geography? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure, Tycho. I would tell you the bulk of it is probably, really in the Breast Imaging business. I would love to say that it's broader than that, Bob. I'm not sure if you've seen anything else in your early days to say other big opportunities to extract price? Robert W. McMahon: No, I would agree with you, Steve. I think like others, we are also seeing some pricing headwinds in some other areas of the business. And what we're trying to do is where we have the opportunity to extract that value as you talked about. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : When you commented -- go ahead, Steve. Stephen P. MacMillan: No, you go. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : You did comment on ThinPrep coming down, that's obviously been a trend for a while, but did you take a more significant step down this quarter and maybe just talk on within the market, what are you seeing vis-a-vis Roche getting the primary claim? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure, I think we're still seeing, in the U.S., fairly steady, it flips a little bit up and down. We can't say that we're slowing the decline yet in the U.S. on ThinPrep. And we still had a little bit of softness in China just as we're shifting to some dealers and some things on that front. So ThinPrep has continued to be a big headwind and I think it's important to point out if we didn't have that, that we'd be a lot more optimistic probably, about where we're going. But it's still a very profitable, high-margin business. It's going to be a headwind even in 2015 and so forth ahead of us but I think we're feeling it's still going down. We're working on trying to slow it and we're just not ready to declare that we're near the bottom yet. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Maybe start with Breast Health, and then a quick follow-up on Diagnostics. Steve or Bob, maybe you can give us a sense of how much 3D mammography service revenue was a driver this quarter? Our understanding is that a lot of systems are beyond sort of that 1 year, 18 month mark in terms of being out of warranty. So how much of a driver was that this quarter and what do you expect in terms of 3D services when you look into next quarter and next year? Stephen P. MacMillan: Bob, do we have the breakout of 3D versus 2D [indiscernible]. Robert W. McMahon: Yes, I don't think we're going to be prepared to talk to the breakout of our service revenue between 2D and 3D. Stephen P. MacMillan: Yes, but I think it... Robert W. McMahon: But overall, I mean, our service revenue, which is primarily, obviously, in our Digital Mammography business, grew 8.5% as I mentioned. That was helping drive the Breast Health. We see that as a very positive development, given the large installed base of digital mammography systems that we have. And while I'm not going to project going forward, we don't see that significantly dropping off. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : No, it's helpful. And just a quick one on [indiscernible] maybe specifically on the Gen-Probe business. When Gen-Probe was acquired, the strategy really was to stay focused on women's health. And some of the business there have already been sold while others, such as say, oncology and respiratory have not. So maybe just an update on where you sit in the Diagnostics portfolio? Should we expect further asset sales or is that sort of where you like -- where the business should be at this point in terms of the portfolio? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. I think we have that portfolio pretty well set at this stage now, so with what we have. By the way, to also answer a previous -- I realized I didn't answer the second part of Tycho's question around HPV and its link to this. We do continue to feel very good about co-testing. And therefore, ThinPrep I think, is still playing a very strong role in that going forward. And meanwhile, even though we don't have the primary indication for HPV, we feel good about the direction we're going there. Operator : And we'll go next to Vijay Kumar with ISI Group. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Maybe on the first question, big picture on the Diagnostics side. High-single digits in the U.S. And first, I know that Aptima franchise sort of performed well, but I feel like that franchise in the last quarter, it wasn't great, but then now, it's back high-singles. What's really driving this? Was this the Quest contract? And how should we think about sort of the run rate on a go-forward basis? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. Clearly, the Molecular business right now in the U.S. is being boosted by Quest. So were going to get a 4-quarter run on that and, therefore, we don't want to get too excited about exactly what that will be once that all anniversaries. We are feeling very good about HPV. We're making great strides there and I really like our trajectory there. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : And maybe as a follow-up on that. I think one of your earlier comments in optimizing the back structure caught my attention. And can you walk through sort of this blocking and tackling? And given your revenue mix, like 75% in the U.S., where do you think the tax rate could go? How long is going to take? And can you think of anything else that could accelerate the process in decreasing the tax rates? Robert W. McMahon: Vijay, this is Bob. I think we're still in the early stages, so I'm not going to get into specific numbers around when we think that the tax rate can go down, but rest assured that's something that is high on my agenda. What I would say is, with the opportunities that we're having around up and expanding our International business, there's a number of opportunities that we can do with looking at our footprint in redomiciling [ph] things like IP, and so forth. This is something that's going to take time. As you mentioned, we have 75% of our revenues in the U.S. and we're still growing our U.S. business. But this is something that we're going to be focused on and actually have already started doing some of the kind of the blocking and tackling, and that's why some of our G&A costs are actually high year-over-year, as we're starting to rationalize some legal entities to help prepare or pave the road for optimizing some of our tax structures going forward. So we're starting to do that. When we have a more concrete plan, we will share that with you. Stephen P. MacMillan: Suffice it to say, it won't really impact even 2015. Robert W. McMahon: That's a fair comment. Operator : And we'll go next to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : So beyond the, call it, 1-year boost from Quest, certainly the diligence does suggest that customers that have maybe been previously looking at some alternatives are seeking or looking to stick with Hologic. So I'm curious, so what have you done organizationally to, I guess, improve your overall competitive dynamic within the existing team? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. We've really got, I'd say, it's 2 things. It's that Panther instrument, which is just a dynamite instrument. Eric Compton and Bob, both as they came over -- Eric our Chief Operating Officer. I know when he first went out to San Diego and saw the Panther system was, dare I say, salivating and incredibly excited at what a good instrument it is. And our team, I think that's really the biggest part of the magic we got out of the Gen-Probe business. Combined with our sales leadership, we have -- I really like what our sales leadership is doing in that business. And if you think about some of the magic that we probably haven't talked about quite as much, but bringing the physician sales force, along with the lab sales force and getting them really working together to help support the labs, I think, is a competitive advantage for us that is starting to show and kick in a little bit. So again, it's really a sales execution story and sales leadership and rep story, along with the instrumentation. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Understood. And then as a follow up, and I recognize that we don't have a perfect crystal ball here, but any color on where you think the reimbursement might shake out for 3D? And then maybe asking in a slightly different way, where do think it has to be in order to help accelerate the overall adoption there? Stephen P. MacMillan: I don't -- I think just -- it's almost -- this will sound like a cop out, but frankly, just getting it solidified, whether there was any differentiation or not, is enough that we ought to be able to sell the heck out of this product. This product is truly differentiated. And whether it becomes a small premium or medium premium, frankly, I don't think I want the investment community worried about a specific number. I would tell you, as I sit here, I worry people are going to peg a number and say gee, if it's above X or below Y, that it's not as meaningful. And at the end of the day, just having it quoted, we assume there will be differentiation, but we would also plan even worse case if it wasn't differentiated, but we still want to be able to drive this franchise incredibly well regardless of where it plays out. So I don't want to headline a #1 way or the other, and we ought to be able to drive it. Operator : And we'll take our next question form Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : So international surgical has been a real success story the last couple of quarters, really last 3 at least. I guess to move from baseball to football analogies, given that you and the new team are in Patriots country now, can you talk about what quarter you are in driving NovaSure and MyoSure growth internationally? And if there are ways to further leverage some of the successful o U.S. commercial efforts that have been ongoing? Stephen P. MacMillan: I think we're still in the pre-season. There is years and years of growth ahead of us for our surgical business outside the U.S. and we're literally -- we're in the basics here of figuring out country-by-country, a reimbursement strategy and where we go. So it ought to be a very nice double-digit growth story for a long, long time. So if we play the one game, then we're clearly in the first quarter. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then, I guess, this is sort of another pricing question but keeping in mind as we've talked about a little bit over the course of this call that there's been some new approvals in chlamydia and gonorrhea and of course, the recent Roche HPV label expansion. Are you factoring in any assumptions for incremental pricing pressure in Molecular Diagnostics in the fourth quarter? And that may be too quick, but as we think about 2015, as some of these new approvals competitively are coming about, should we be assuming that there is some incremental price? Is that how you're thinking about things? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. Less about the fourth quarter, but I think we are concerned a bit about the pricing pressure in that space. It's getting more competitive, certainly and I think is one of the headwinds we will face going forward in the molecular business. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Just a couple questions on the Diagnostics. In terms of the Quest rollout, how far along are you in realizing the benefits of this agreement? Meaning, are they 75% through the transition, more, less? Robert W. McMahon: Yes, I would say we're -- this is Bob. So to follow that same analogy, I mean, we're pretty close to -- we've rolled it out, we've been very successful, we continue to see nice volume increases associated with our Diagnostics business. And as I mentioned, Quest is a portion of that. And we signed that about mid-year last year. And so, that ramp-up will start anniversary-ing itself, some in the third quarter this year, but more in the fourth quarter. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just as a follow-up. Thinking about the impact of Panther to the Diagnostics franchise, are most of the devices you're selling pulling through incremental volume or are they cannibalizing the existing base? Stephen P. MacMillan: It's bits of both but we're clearly getting some incremental business and a reasonable chunk of incremental, but we're also upgrading existing customers as well. Operator : And we have time for only one more question. That final question will come from Jon Groberg with Macquarie. Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research : So I guess, my main question is around CapEx side of things. At AACC, there's a hospital who just kind of off the cuff mentioned that there was a potential new tax law that would require hospitals to actually capitalize their instruments as opposed to getting the benefit of the reagent rental. I was just curious if that's something that you have dug into or know about? And if there's any kind of update there that you can share with us now that might impact the business? Stephen P. MacMillan: I don't think we know much about that. Robert W. McMahon: No, we haven't. Stephen P. MacMillan: We're not sure. I haven't heard that. Unknown Executive : By the way, we don't let [indiscernible] either. Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research : Okay. That was just there was a big hospital chain who just mentioned something that I'm trying to dig at maybe into a little bit more. And then, I guess, for Bob. On the Roka side, what is the royalty now? And does it have the potential to be material or is it no longer material? Robert W. McMahon: Yes, so we -- the royalties that we've received to date are de minimis. And actually, the details actually can be found on the Res 1. Our royalty rate was 12% and it has an option to go, depending on performance and the paydown, it could be to 8% and eventually, to 4%. But I would say, this is kind of a one-time. We haven't seen any material revenue associated with that royalty to date, and don't expect that this would have a material impact in '15. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call. Have a good evening.",

Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division John Zecy - Morningstar Inc., Research Division Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic, Inc. Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Amber, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Deborah R. Gordon: Thank you, Amber. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Hologic's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will consist of opening remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. The replay of this call will be archived on our website through Wednesday, November 26 and a copy of our fourth quarter release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Also in that section is a supplemental financial presentation related to the comments that will be made during today's opening remarks. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during the call may be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can also be found in our fourth quarter earnings release. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan. Stephen P. MacMillan: Thank you, Deb, and thank you for joining us today. It has now been almost 11 months since I joined Hologic. Before diving into the specific results, I'd like to give a little context to where we've been and where we're headed. Quite simply, while our business lines have not changed significantly, Hologic today is a dramatically different company than 12 months ago and will be even stronger in the coming year. To reset the clock, a year ago, our sales were in decline across the board. Our debt load was prohibited. Many of our businesses, such as blood screening, cytology, skeletal and surgical, all appeared to be in long-term decline and we had weak credibility with many of you in the investment community. We had activist entering the stock and good employees exiting the company, as bonuses have been slashed for the rank and file in order to prevent even sharper earnings misses. As I joined the company in December and we subsequently reported another quarter of sharp sales and earnings declines, huge questions existed, including our future direction, capital allocation, reimbursement for 3D mammography and a host of other questions. And as you might expect, employee morale was low. What has followed has been a dramatic refocusing of our business on growth, our customers and our people, which hopefully becomes even clearer with this quarter's results. Those of you who know me well know that we are far from celebrating. And let me be perfectly clear here. We have opportunities to continue improving essentially every aspect of this company. But we do feel good that we're achieving things that few would have thought possible just 9 months ago, providing nice momentum to continue our progress in the quarters and years ahead. Three quick examples are : one, after long-term declines in our surgical business, which continued through the first 2 quarters of this fiscal year, this business has rebounded in the last few quarters and even posted ever so modest growth for the full year, a very nice turnaround; two, our blood screening business, which has been challenged and declining for many quarters, is now growing, boosted by the Japan Red Cross win earlier this year. This will provide a boost for the next few quarters, while we work with our partner, Grifols, to explore additional opportunities to grow this business; three, our international business, also underperforming and declining for many quarters, began to rebound this quarter. While our blood screening business clearly contributed to this growth, it is important to note that all of our franchises actually posted growth outside the U.S. in the latest quarter. It's a good start and indicative of the big opportunity which exists for us outside the U.S. In fact, 3 of our 4 franchises ended up growing, albeit modestly for the year, a major turnaround from previous results and a nice accomplishment considering where we stood after the first quarter. And even better, all franchises grew in the fourth quarter for the first time. What is behind these results? The simplest answer is a completely new and very accomplished leadership team, combined with some strong performance from our sales leaders and sales teams during a period of great change. I'd like to touch a little more on the depth, breadth and speed of the leadership transitions. By the end of May, we had completely replaced the top line leaders of the company, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Head of International. But within the next few months, we've also put new presidents into our 2 largest businesses, Breast & Skeletal Health and, most recently, Diagnostics. We've also revamped the number of leadership positions on their teams as well. Thus, the magnitude of the change has been far greater than maybe obvious. We realized that those of you who knew that many layers of changes were in store have been concerned about the execution risk and the timing required for these additional changes. So we have moved very quickly and we're beginning to see results. I am proud that our team did not just write off the year, but in fact, we began to put points on the board early while driving major changes to strengthen us for the future. This all leads to where we are today, on a clear path to sustainable and accelerated organic growth. We finished the fourth quarter with all 4 franchises posting year-over-year growth and posted growth domestically and internationally. We are ending fiscal 2014 with much healthier businesses and on a growth trajectory moving into fiscal 2015, a very different story than a year ago. Now let's briefly review our fiscal fourth quarter results to provide a bit more color about the progress we are making. Our underlying revenues were $640 million, up a healthy 3% from last year and represented the third consecutive quarter of growth. Additionally, we recorded a $20 million onetime revenue benefit we received in the fourth quarter, which Bob will discuss separately. Importantly, the strength emerging in this quarter is broader and deeper than anything we've generated in quite some time. A few simple details : all 4 franchises posted global growth, a first; 3 of our 4 franchises grew in the U.S.; and all 4 franchises posted healthy growth outside the U.S; and our total international business grew for the first time in many quarters. The exciting part here is how the momentum is built throughout the year. In our fiscal first quarter, 1 franchise grew while the other 3 were down; in the second quarter, we had 2 up, 2 down; third quarter, 3 up, 1 down; and now in the fourth quarter, all 4 are up on a global basis. And while we even have a new and formidable competitor in the mammo business and revenues only looked okay, let's just say we finished the year with exceptional growth in orders, which bodes very well for the coming year. Now let me touch on 2 recent developments. The first is Tom West, our new President of the Diagnostics division. Tom has a proven track record of success with global experience at increasing levels of responsibility throughout his career, most recently, during his 20-plus years at Johnson & Johnson. He has already hit the ground running and we are confident that given Tom's expertise and track record for driving results, he will capitalize on the many opportunities we have within this franchise. The second is the recent announcement by CMS of reimbursement rates for 3D mammography screening and diagnostic services. Not only did CMS set an incremental, add-on reimbursement rate for both screening and diagnostic, but they also set a rate that speaks to the importance of Hologic's game-changing technology. Let me summarize this for you. In short, there is now formal incremental reimbursement in place at approximately $57 for both 3D mammography screening and diagnostic exams. This rate is in addition to the existing 2D mammography screening and diagnostic rates, all of which were maintained at the same level as in 2014. So together with the extensive body of published data, including the landmark JAMA study, we believe this is a win not only for Hologic, but most importantly, for women whom we hope will have greater access to this incredible technology. Before turning the call over to Bob for a more detailed financial discussion, I would like to share with you our high-level fiscal 2015 objectives and outlook. We expect to report low single-digit top line that is 2% to 3.5% sales growth operationally, high single-digit net income and mid-single-digit EPS growth due to dilution. And I'd like to mention right here that our true growth rate will be almost 1 point higher when adjusting for the MRI divestiture we just completed and which Bob will speak more about in a few minutes. While there are many factors which go into the full plan, the key elements to achieve this growth are simply : one, accelerating growth in our U.S. Breast Health business; and two, significantly accelerating our international business. We feel very good about our ability to achieve this step change in annual growth and strong cost controls will yield leverage earnings growth. We've set the stage in fiscal 2014 and we will continue to execute and build on the strong momentum. So overall, while we're not yet where we want to be, we have delivered on our promise not only to improve, but to grow each franchise. We said we would focus on accelerating growth, paying down debt and improving our return on invested capital and we are doing all 3. The fourth quarter marked the milestone with each franchise returning to growth and we expect this momentum to accelerate in fiscal 2015. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bob. Robert W. McMahon: Thank you, Steve. I am pleased to speak to our fourth quarter financial results and then I will provide more detail on our guidance for the full year and first quarter of fiscal '15. Unless otherwise noted, all of my commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year non-GAAP basis. Before getting into the divisional results, I'll first remind investors that during our fourth quarter, we entered into an amended license agreement with Roka Bioscience and we received $20 million in cash and stock. This was recorded as revenue within our Diagnostics segment and it resulted in an incremental $0.05 in EPS in the quarter. All of my commentary on the fourth quarter will be based on our underlying business results and then, therefore, will be net of this onetime benefit. Fourth quarter revenues were $640 million, up 3% on a reported basis and up 2.8% operationally or on a constant currency basis as compared to $622 million in the prior year. These results were at the high end of our guidance range of $630 million to $640 million. Again, this excludes the onetime $20 million revenue contribution. As Steve mentioned, we are pleased to report that all 4 divisions reported growth in the quarter. And looking at the divisional results. Excluding the onetime $20 million revenue benefit, our Diagnostics business posted revenues of $297 million, up a reported 2.4% and up 2.3% operationally versus the prior year. Cytology and perinatal revenues declined 3% on a reported basis to $121 million. U.S. and international revenues declined 4% and 1%, respectively. We continue to see domestic ThinPrep volume being pressured by interval expansion, but we are encouraged to see the improvements internationally as we began to refocus our sales efforts on key markets and improve our execution. Our molecular diagnostics business increased 3% to $117 million driven by the U.S. results. Our core Aptima franchise experienced healthy growth primarily due to the continued uptake at Quest, the broader adoption of Aptima HPV, as well as gains in the CT/GC and Trichomonas. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in instrument sales as we sold $9 million worth of TIGRIS systems to Quest in the fourth quarter of last year. Our blood screening business had revenues of $59 million and increased 14% driven by international growth, primarily due to the Japanese Red Cross deal, partially offsetting by the declines in the U.S. From an instrument standpoint, we had another strong quarter with Panther as customers continue to see the benefits of our superior automation. Our installed base increased approximately 80% in fiscal '14 and we are on track to place 1,000 instruments globally by the end of fiscal '15. Now moving on to Breast Health. Revenues in this division were $241 million, up a reported 3.1% and up 3% operationally. This was driven primarily by strong global 3D mammography system sales and service revenue. Partially offsetting this increase was the anticipated decline of 2D system sales as customers shift to 3D. In addition, as Steve mentioned, we ended the quarter with a strong order backlog and feel very good about the continued growth in this division, especially with the reimbursement news. Turning to GYN Surgical franchise. Revenues were $78 million, up a reported 2.3% and up 2.1% operationally. This was the second consecutive quarter of growth, a trend we expect to continue. This performance was led by double-digit MyoSure and single-digit international NovaSure growth, offset by a mid-single digit decline in U.S. NovaSure sales. And finally, our Skeletal Health revenues were $23 million, up a reported 10.4% and up 10.3% operationally. We are seeing nice traction in sales of our new Horizon platform. Now moving on to our fourth quarter performance for the rest of the P&L. Gross margins were 63.6%, up 210 basis points from last year, slightly higher than our implied guidance for the quarter, driven primarily by favorable product revenue mix. Operating expenses were $199 million, representing a 14% increase and in line with our guidance. We finished the quarter with EPS of $0.38, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.01. Before turning to the balance sheet, I would like to share that we successfully closed the sale of our MRI breast coils product line to Philips at the end of fourth quarter. While I'm not going to provide the details on the transaction, the product line did generate revenues of approximately $20 million on an annualized basis. This is an example of a product line divestiture that will help us focus resources on more strategic and core areas of the company. This divestiture did not impact our fourth quarter non-GAAP results. Now turning to the balance sheet. We continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was $132 million for the quarter and $508 million for the year. In addition, we made $595 million worth of principal payments in fiscal '14 and ended the year with $742 million in cash. This resulted in $3.5 billion of net debt, down from $4 billion in net debt at the beginning of the year. We improved our return on invested capital and ended the year at 9.3% versus 8.3% last year. And finally, we did not repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter. I will now discuss our non-GAAP guidance which, as a reminder, is detailed in our supplementary PowerPoint presentation. Fiscal '15 growth rates are on a year-over-year basis and do not include the onetime revenue benefit of $20 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. I also encourage you to model to the midpoint of the guidance ranges, which is how we think about the outlook. Our guidance will first be based on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency. We believe this provides better insight into the performance of the business. We will also provide estimates of our revenue and EPS with the impact that current exchange rates are expected to have on the translation of those results. For fiscal '15, we expect revenues to increase approximately 2% to 3.5% on an operational or constant currency basis. To put that in perspective, when adjusting for the MRI breast coils divestiture, the growth rate would be approximately 3% to 4.5%, clearly, accelerated organic growth versus our performance in 2014. To help frame in the impact of currency, if full year fiscal '15 exchange rates were similar -- were to remain similar to the current exchange rates as of last week, our growth rate would decrease approximately 100 basis points. This would result in reported revenue growth of approximately 1% to 2.5% or revenues between $2.54 billion and $2.57 billion, which is what we suggest you use in your models. We expect continuing momentum coming out of fiscal '14 and our guidance assumes that all 4 segments will grow operationally in fiscal '15, led by mid-single-digit growth in our Breast Health franchise. This is despite the approximately 2-point headwind associated with the MRI divestiture. We also expect slightly positive growth in our Diagnostics business, low single-digit growth in surgical and mid-single digit growth in our skeletal franchise. To further help you with your modeling, we expect gross margins to remain relatively consistent with full year fiscal '14 actuals, leverage in operating expenses as a percent of sales, net interest expense of $175 million, 286 million diluted shares and a 34.75% tax rate. As a result, for fiscal '15, we expect EPS to increase to a range of $1.50 to $1.54, representing approximately 3% to 5.5% growth on a reported basis. We expect to achieve this growth despite the expectation of a negative foreign exchange impact of approximately $0.03 as our manufacturing footprint is predominantly U.S.-based. Our EPS guidance translates to reported net income growth of 5% to 8% after stripping out the impact of share dilution. Lastly, we expect to generate operating cash flows in the range of $510 million to $525 million and capital expenditures to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million. I hope you find this additional color helpful and again, I encourage you to focus your modeling on the midpoint of our ranges. Now moving on to guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '15. We expect revenues to increase between 3% and 4.5% on an operational and constant currency basis. We estimate that foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by approximately 100 basis points resulting in reported revenue growth of 2% to 3.5%. We are, therefore, introducing guidance of $625 million to $635 million. We also expect EPS of $0.35 to $0.36, representing growth of 3% to 6% on a reported basis. Finally, I would like to wrap up by reiterating that deleveraging remains one of our top priorities and return on invested capital remains an important performance metrics for driving shareholder value and as such, this continues to be a significant component of executive compensation. While our performance is improving, we believe we can do better and we will be -- remain focused on helping the organization improve ROIC over time. With that, I will turn the call back over to Steve. Stephen P. MacMillan: Great. Before we take questions, I'd like to summarize by reiterating that while we are encouraged by the improved results we saw in fiscal 2014, we still have a lot of work to do. To that end, we would like to remind every one of our commitments going into fiscal 2015. One, we expect to drive accelerated annual revenue income growth across all of our franchisees. Two, we will continue to invest in our global infrastructure with the main focus on our customer-facing teams, getting the right people in the right roles and improving our R&D productivity. And three, we are committed to paying down debt and generating strong cash flows. In closing, we feel good about the progress to date, feel even better about our future and you can count on us to deliver on our commitments. With that, operator, please open the call up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : So just quickly, I guess, on the guidance. I just want to make sure that the guidance excludes the $20 million of divestitures. And how do you sort of handicap the recent CMS reimbursement on 3D tomo? And I guess, I'm trying to get down from the top line to the bottom line, the EPS guide looks a little weak, so any color would be helpful. Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. Vijay, why don't I start it and Bob can jump in. So just to clarify, the divestitures are gone. So we took -- basically, the Roka stuff was a 2014 event. So we haven't counted that in either. On 2015, we had about $20 million of MRI business. That's normally part of Breast Health that would've been in there, that we haven't pulled it out as a separate item. But so we're basically just going to be going against that. So it depresses a little bit of that growth rate and probably looks a little funny to the models because, trust me, we feel really good about where the Breast Health business is going, particularly to your point on the reimbursement. And I think the way we look at the reimbursement right now is it's a little early to get too far ahead of ourselves. And I'll give a macro comment. Right now, at this point in time, is we're making great progress. It'd be really easy to be celebrating and getting a little bit ahead of ourselves. And I think from a guidance standpoint, we want to continue to be sensible and let each quarter continue to play out and let us put the points on the board. But don\u2019t mistake that for lack of confidence in terms of where we're headed. Particularly with the reimbursement part, it gives us a lot of excitement for where that business ought to be going in the coming year. Bob, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything? Robert W. McMahon: No, I think just quickly regarding the guidance. As we were looking through our numbers in the models, because our manufacturing footprint is predominantly U.S.-based, the exchange rate and the translation of those exchanges hit the top line, but they don\u2019t hit our cost base. And so what you see is that $0.03, which is probably a little greater than what you would look at as our average overall company when you're trying to do the margin. So that's where we get there -- why we got to the numbers that we have. What I would say is when we're looking at our operating margins from a gross margin perspective, we're looking at those relatively consistently flat, so we're going to look at levers to offset those downsides and then also looking at operating expenses and leveraging those, not at the expense of future growth. So we continue to build or forecasting continued investments in our R&D areas and, to a certain extent, our sales and marketing organizations. It's primarily around the back office functions where we're looking to streamline. Operator : We will go next to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And maybe just kind of a follow-on on that last topic. Can you maybe, Steve, just touch on some of the operational priorities for '15? You talked about some of management changes you made this past year, but maybe just talk about where you are in the process of evaluating manufacturing footprint? When could we start to see some tax rate leverages? Is that more of a '16 event? And just maybe some of the other operational initiatives that are going to be unfolding over the coming year? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure, Tycho. The simple things in terms of focal points for 2015 are driving the heck out of our U.S. mammo business. And we feel really good about both the way orders finished up for the year and where we ought to be going on that business this year. Really getting our international business, turning that from promise and hope into the early stages of very clear reality. So I think you'll that. And the third one that really goes across all of our businesses, is really just improving our -- I hate to use the term commercial excellence, but it did -- does come down to that in terms of our selling, our marketing, our customer service through the whole gamut. And I think that level of operational excellence is going to be driving that improved growth rate as we go into 2015. In terms of both manufacturing strategy and tax, I think there, you've got to assume that's going to be more a '16 event. We clearly are -- to Bob's point, we're getting hit bigger as on the FX piece, with the dollar strengthening and virtually all of our manufacturing in the U.S. at this stage, it underscores that need to be looking at a more global manufacturing footprint over time. But we're being -- we've had a lot on our plate in the early stages here just to get sales and the basics going again. That will be the area that manufacturing and tax, that will really start to drive in the future years. So I kind of keep thinking about it. Current, call it, '15, '16, as far about short-term execution with what we have and call it, somewhere in the '16 and really '17 and beyond, is realizing more of those longer-term benefits. Operator : And we will go next to Rich Newitter with Leerink Partners. Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Steve, I just -- I'm jumping between calls. I apologize if this is a repeat, but what -- can you just remind us in the Breast Health, what is baked in with respect to the MRI divestiture? You said that your guidance -- it takes out the $20 million, correct? So it would be $20 million higher. And then also what about with respect to the exceptionally strong order growth that you referenced on the call? How much of that is factored into the 2015 growth outlook? Stephen P. MacMillan: Yes, let's take the first part. So the -- basically, this year, we did $20 million of revenue on MRI coils. That's in our base for '14 that will evaporate in '15. So effectively, what you're looking at is the growth rate for next year is depressed by not having that $20 million in the numbers. So said differently, mid-single digit. We're basically -- we're giving up 2 points of growth in the comparison. The additional part in terms of the exceptional orders growth, just, say, they were very, very good when -- certainly, in our 10-K, they'll be out there, but we saw real strong growth, much of which was in the Breast Health area. So it gives us great confidence coming into 2015. Robert W. McMahon: Yes, just to add on to that, Steve. If you looked at our performance on a year-to-date basis in '14 versus where we're projecting '15, it's clearly an acceleration on our Breast Health business. So year-to-date, on an operational basis, approximately 4% we're saying mid-single digits for '15, that included -- that incorporates this $20 million headwind associated with the MRI divestiture. So if we didn't have that, that mid-single digits would be up by another 2 points. Operator : We'll go next to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Shu Wang - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : This is actually Scott Wang in for David. Steve, can you discuss your outlook on the 3D tomography business and what it contributed to growth this quarter, what you expect for the trajectory going forward? And whether the acceleration in tomo adoption and conversion will be a little different from the adoption curve for 2D, given the existing installed base out there? Stephen P. MacMillan: Yes, I think we feel great about where it's going to go. And in '15, it will clearly be accelerating versus the full year of '14. So in '14, as Bob just mentioned, we posted 4% growth. We clearly see that accelerating even with a couple of points of headwind from the divestiture to the MRI coil. So we see it definitely accelerating. Relative to your question about 2D versus the original 2D adoption, probably not quite the same curve. It's a different marketplace today. Capital constraints are different. So you've got -- basically, you've got a stronger installed base and you also have still much greater scrutiny on capital purchases within the hospital environment. So we continue to see this playing out over quarters and quarters. And dare I say, over the coming quarters, really, over the next couple of years, it's part of what makes us feel great about where we're headed here, not just for a 1- or 2-quarter pop, but really a much more sustainable driver over a bunch of quarters coming forward. Operator : And we will go next to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I wanted to ask question on Diagnostics. You've obviously done well there at the past year, winning some major contracts in molecular and -- as well as screening -- blood screening, rather. But one thing I did notice is that the competitive landscape in HPV is changing pretty quickly here and some of your competitors are going after screening labels. Either they have them already or they're going after them for the future. So number one, do you think you guys need to get a screening label to kind of keep the momentum you have? And if so, how should we think about the OpEx impact there, which is on the R&D line? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. I'd say, more than anything, we feel really good about how our HPV business is performing. And I think it's pretty clear that we're growing significantly faster than the market. It's a key franchise for us and we're very focused. Whether we exactly need that label, we're always looking at what is the right labeling and what we need to go forth, but we think between both our existing franchise, we feel like we're in very good shape. Operator : We will go next to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : A question for me. Very limited sequential slippage in the cytology and perinatal business. So how close do we think we are to kind of seeing the end of the impact of the screening interval extension? And then on blood screening, just curious, you highlighted that as a potential growth avenue down the road. Just curious how much potentially you see here in the hepatitis E asset that Grifols has in Europe right now? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. Let me start with the cytology piece. We want to be very careful not to be out in front of declaring a bottom on the interval expansion. I'd say we're getting cautiously optimistic in terms of some of the slowdown in the growth rate. But until we've proven it, if you know anything about kind of myself and Bob's style, it's going to be let us prove things instead of going out and proclaiming them and we'd rather let the aftereffects really speak for themselves. So I think we feel good about that. And on the blood screening business, I think we feel really good about being partnered with Grifols outside the U.S. and certainly, what they're working on as well. Operator : And we will go next to Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : I guess, I just wanted to ask about the GE system, their 3D system. What are you seeing, from a competitive standpoint, pricing-wise? And just how are they positioning against your system? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. We, frankly, really like the competitive advantage we still feel we have. So at the end of the day, they got -- as you know, they got a noninferiority claim. Theirs takes longer to administer. And the way they're obviously going to try to play to this, they're a great marketing force, you know that well. They're certainly going to try to bundle and get their GE houses. I think we feel really good about our installed base. We feel good that we're still, certainly in the recent quarter, still getting a number of competitive wins coming over and I think where it goes first is largely to their installed base and that will be still a formidable force for us. But I think we feel really good about the differentiation that we have. Operator : And we will go next to Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Bob, maybe just a quick housekeeping one. On the EPS impact from the MRI divestiture and then a quick follow-up, for 2015 guidance. Robert W. McMahon: Yes. So the EPS impact from the MRI divestiture is de minimis. It's really on the top line, where the biggest impact is. So it doesn't affect our guidance one way or another. Stephen P. MacMillan: Great. And then the follow-up? Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : The region assay revenue stream on that system in particular, the menu is equivalent to a TIGRIS, so just kind of I would like to get an update on where that annual annuity stream is today and where maybe that can go by the end of '15? Stephen P. MacMillan: What was that? I'm sorry, there was a question that got partially cut off. We didn't hear all of that question. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Is that better now? Stephen P. MacMillan: Yes. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay, great. Just a quick question on Panther, an update there. If you can give us an update on where the annual revenue stream is in terms of reagents. The menu has expanded and is equivalent to TIGRIS at this point. Just wondering where that stands today and maybe where it can go by the end of '15? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. We're more focused in terms of disclosing on Panther placements, which as Bob mentioned, very good, where basically we increased our Panther placements by about 80% in the year. So exiting the year very strong. We're not giving per revenue numbers for the actual instrument. Operator : And we will go next to Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : So the first one is on 3D, just a quick one, balancing incremental reimbursement with incremental competition. What assumption for 3D pricing is embedded into guidance? And then the second question is on Panther. Any chance you would provide an update on the outlook for the virology program? If I remember correctly, I think the plan was to roll out some menu internationally in calendar '15 and that in the U.S. about a year later, these products are priced at pretty nice levels, but trials can be pretty expensive. So any details you could provide on plans and timelines would be appreciated, especially given that I think this could have some initial margin pressure, but then again depending on how you're thinking about pricing and keeping in mind some of the pressures on the STD menu from a pricing standpoint, this could actually benefit you as we think about it a year or 2 out. Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure, Doug. On the -- first, on the 3D mammo pricing, we want to be pretty disciplined and feel like we've got the best product on the market. And therefore, don't want to compete on price. So we're not assuming much erosion on the ASP at this point in time. On the virology piece. You're dead right, which is the R&D programs to get these things approved are a lot of money and that's a lot of what we're spending right now without the benefits of what will come. We do hope by the end of calendar year '15, which really gets into our fiscal '16, to be able to have the beginning of launches in Europe. And then to your point, probably at least a year behind that as it relates to the U.S. So right now, we're making the investments in the virology program. The paybacks, which really are at least 12 months out at this point or the beginnings of those paybacks at least. Stephen P. MacMillan: Yes, just to follow up on that. Some of the guidance that we talked about for the first quarter incorporates some heavier R&D spend because of the timing of those development programs in the viral load area. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Can you talk specifically around that target that you had for 500 incremental placements for 3D? I didn't catch if you guys had commented specifically on that. And then with respect to divestitures, you made a small one, obviously, with the breast coils. Should we look for potentially other things that you're considering small product line that might be sold over the next 12 months? Stephen P. MacMillan: Yes. So for the placement goal in the U.S. of 500 placements, we did exceed that. In fact, we placed 588 units for the year on 3D. So we feel very good about that and obviously, feel better about the future. Regarding the MRI business, can you repeat the question? Robert W. McMahon: Do we have more plan like that? I think, at this point, we've largely done a lot of a cleanup. And we do realize, it kind of makes the models and it makes things look a little muckier than, particularly, as you look at our true growth rate next year and we haven't wanted to restate everything just given the magnitude of it, but we ask you to be mindful of it. Operator : And we'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel. Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Maybe the first one, just specific to the P&L. The gross margin, I think you said expect sort of flattish year-over-year. And you had pretty good expansion this year, I think to the tune of roughly 100 basis points. Notably, you had a lot of momentum in the back part of the year. Can you just talk to the dynamics of why that will be flat year-over-year and you wouldn't see any further expansion? And then I've just got a follow-up. Stephen P. MacMillan: Yes, in simple terms, why don't I start it and then Bob can add. The simplest way to think about gross margin in 2015 is we have a heavy U.S. manufacturing base in the decline of the dollar. Clear -- or the strengthening of the dollar clearly puts more pressure on our gross margin piece. The other piece is as we grow our business outside the U.S., we're often doing that through dealers that are in a lower gross margin piece. So we effectively we're going to offset those pressures by really improved manufacturing efficiencies. Bob, did you want to add... Robert W. McMahon: No, that's exactly right. Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. Very helpful. And then, Steve, I feel a little bit silly asking you for additional color or guidance on the data you gave 2015. But you've done a great job, you turned the corner, you're sort of growing in and around mid-single digit when you normalize for MRI, netbacks, et cetera. Just when you look out a little bit longer term, do you have the current portfolio to drive a further acceleration to high single digit? Or do you think you would need to go out and just have a few tuck-ins in order to accelerate them even further? Stephen P. MacMillan: Thanks, Jon. Probably to get to high single digits, I would say probably a few tuck-ins along the way. I do think we're making great progress. We said at the start of the year, the first thing we need to do is slow down the declines of our declining franchises and accelerate growth of those that will grow. And I think we're making good progress there. Ultimately, if we can flatline a few of the declining ones and keep accelerating, can we get into at least mid -- at the high end of mid-single digits? I think organically, probably. To truly turn it into the high single digits may require a few tuck-ins along the way. And again, make no mistake about it, we're not going to go back to the big acquisition stuff, but we will look for prudent acquisitions. The great flip side of the organization right now is, everybody feels, every sales member, feels we've got a great bag to sell right now and that is encouraging. Operator : We'll go next to John Zecy with MorningStar. John Zecy - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Obviously, you've done really well with all the Panther placements and overall, molecular diagnostics performance. I was hoping you could just maybe talk a bit about what you're hearing on the ground from the low to mid-volume labs? Maybe sort of how their longer-term economics are looking as we maybe progress toward maybe like a more of a bundled payment environment? Just trying to get a sense of how competitive they'll be towards some of their larger reference lab competitors? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. Right now, I'd say, we're probably overdeveloped in the larger labs and we're starting to look -- frankly, we see those as an opportunity. And probably I think they'll -- there will be some shakeouts, certainly, in that part of the lab space. But it's still a very fragmented universe and we actually still see -- regardless of the pressures they feel, we see some opportunities for us, particularly with the Panther system. Robert W. McMahon: Yes, I think to build on that point, Steve, as we think about molecular diagnostics going forward, we foresee continued volume increases, which will sit in the sweet spot of our Panther system. What those labs will have is the same pressures that some of the larger labs have that really our Panther and the benefits of our automation really play into. So we think that over time, we'll be able to take that Panther and go downstream and we think that, that has -- we have a long runway there. Operator : And we will go next to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : I just had one question on mammography. I guess, as I was thinking of modeling, right, why would any customers buy, I guess, 2D dimensional, right? You just have reimbursement for 3D tomo, that's up 57. So I guess, as we're modeling, I mean, for those of us who have product models, like, how should we assume the 2D dimensional versus 3D dimensional? Stephen P. MacMillan: Yes, I think in the U.S, you ought to assume just about everybody would be going to 3D. We do see significant opportunities with our new Head of International, actually for 2D outside the U.S. We still have a lot of hospitals around the world that are still in the analog world and have not converted over to full-field digital mammography. And in a lot of cases, I will tell you, a part of what we're trying to do is sell them 3D tomo and they're still in an analog world. So I think our team is realizing there's probably a great opportunity to stepwise them in and get demand on the 2D side. And then, by the way, have the annuity down the road, we can upgrade them to 3D in the future. So I think the U.S. will be virtually, mostly 3D, but outside the U.S., there will probably some opportunities for 2D. Operator : We have time for only one more question. We will go to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Just thinking ahead to RSNA, any color on what you might be highlighting? I think, last year, one of the things that you talked a little bit about was contrast mammography potentially replacing breast MRI. And I'm wondering, thinking about the divestiture, if contrast mammography potentially helps you overcome some of the shortfall from the divestiture? Stephen P. MacMillan: Yes. I think the base focal point, candidly, is going to be on our Genius 3D Mammography. We've got such opportunity and such a differentiated product that I don't think we need to reach for other things. And frankly, don't have to do a lot of real marketing or dancing around the edges. I think it's hit them very straight with what we have, Tycho. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call. Have a great evening.",

Bill Bonello - Craig-Hallum Brian Weinstein - William Blair Jayson Bedford - Raymond James Jon Block - Stifel Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic, Inc. First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Vicky, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call. Mike Watts : Thank you, Vicky. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today. They we'll have a question-and-answer session. If you did not already see our first quarter press release, a copy is available in the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a supplemental financial presentation for today's call. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally a replay of this call will be archived on our website through February 28. Before we begin, I need to inform you that certain statements we make during this call may be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our fourth quarter earnings release or the supplemental presentation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Steve MacMillan : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. We're very pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of our fiscal 2015. In short we had a very good quarter and our results reflect the positive strides our team is making. The first quarter was our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth and our highest organic growth rate in a number of years compared to the prior year period, which admittedly was an easy comp. Revenues of $653 million grew 6.6% on a reported basis and 7.7% on a constant currency basis. Importantly, our growth was broad-based in the quarter as all four of our business segments grew between 6% and 8% on a constant currency basis. At the same time, we demonstrated strong earnings leverage in the first quarter. Our goal is to grow profits faster than sales and we accomplished this in the first quarter. While revenues grew 6.6% on a reported basis, non-GAAP net income increased by 18.6% and non-GAAP earnings per share grew by 15.4%. Based on our results in the first quarter and our improving outlook, we are raising our financial guidance for the year. We also were able to voluntarily pay down some of our debt in the quarter, which remains a key priority for us. Bob will give you the details on both of items in a minute. But first, let me just say that we're pleased with the progress we've made thus far in transforming Hologic into a company focused on sustainable organic growth. This transformation is occurring because great products, great people and new leadership are coming together in a powerful way. In terms of products, we maintain market leading shares in several clinically important economically attractive markets which differ about Hologic today is out ability to grow sales in these categories. In some cases, growth is coming from accelerating the adoption of our newest technologies. In digital mammography for example, we were very pleased with the uptake of our Genius 3D tomosynthesis system in the first quarter, as overall breast imaging sales grew at a low double-digit rate. As some of you saw at the RSNA meeting in Chicago interest in our product is strengthening. This is based on a wealth of clinical publications, including the JAMA study, effective marketing by our team, and higher reimbursement levels that recently went into effect for Medicare patients. In other markets, like blood screening, we are growing from market share gains. For example, the new business that our partner Grifols won with the Japanese Red Cross was a significant source of upside in the first quarter. Similarly, although our liquid cytology business continues to decline in the United States based on longer screening intervals, we believe our rate of sales decline has slowed due to market share gains, as well as better focus and execution in the field. The same is true in our surgical business, where slower rates of decline for our NovaSure franchise and even a little growth this quarter have allowed MyoSure growth to shine through. Finally, in the market for sexually transmitted disease testing, growth is coming as we add test volume and menu to our fully automated Panther system. We are rapidly approaching our goal of placing 1,000 Panther systems in clinical diagnostics and blood screening, and revenue per system is growing steadily. The success of our strategy can be seen from the fact that sales of our molecular diagnostic products grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the first quarter, including strong sales growth in the important domestic market. Our product success would not be possible without our people, so I want to give a shout out to any employees listening to this call. From the first day I joined Hologic a little more than a year ago, I\u2019ve been struck by the talent of our employees, and their passionate dedication to our mission. I\u2019m especially grateful to our sales and service teams. They are well-respected by their customers, and their tireless efforts have enabled us to slow sales declines first, and now return to growth. To me, they define commercial excellence. To help our employees achieve their full potential, we have put in place a completely new and highly accomplished leadership team over the last few quarters new COO, new CFO, new Head of International, and new divisional presidents. These executives have made a significant impact already, and really are just now beginning to settle into their roles. They are helping change the mindset of the organization by raising expectations and promoting accountability. Maybe most importantly, they are competitors who know how to win. To round out the senior team, we recently hired John Griffin from Covidien to be our general counsel, and Ali Bebo from Ann Inc to become our Senior Vice President of Human Resources. John and Ali, who will start next week, are both very special leaders who surely will help make our leadership team and our company even stronger. We also hired back Mike Watts last quarter to lead our investor relations efforts. Many of you may know Mike from his years at Gen-Probe, and I know the rest of you will enjoy interacting with him in the future. So in summary, as we look back at my first year at Hologic, I\u2019m proud of the progress we have made, and thrilled to have a team that can lead us to much greater successes. We are clearly ahead of where we expected to be at this point, but it\u2019s still worth noting that we remain in the early innings of our corporate transformation. We realize that we can continue to improve just about everything we do as a company. Building a track record of financial execution is obviously high on our list, with consistent growth in sales and faster growth on the bottom line. In the near-term, the primary drivers to accomplish this are clear, gaining more than our fair share of the breast mammography market, increasing our Panther menu and pull-through, and expanding globally. But in the quarters ahead, we also will focus on revitalizing our R&D pipelines, and continuing to improve our operational efficiency. Over the longer term, as we have discussed before, we believe improving our capital structure and reducing our tax rate can drive additional value for shareholders. It\u2019s an exciting journey that we\u2019re on, and I believe we\u2019re taking steps in the right direction. Now I will hand the call over to Bob to discuss the financials in more detail. Bob McMahon : Thank you Steve. I\u2019m going to discuss our first quarter results and then talk about our updated guidance. Unless otherwise noted, all my commentary will focus on non-GAAP results, and %age changes will be on a year-over-year basis. Steve already discussed total revenue, so I won\u2019t repeat that now, except to reiterate my enthusiasm for the broad-based progress our sales and marketing teams have made. I do want to point out that in response to analyst and investor requests, we have provided some additional product sales detail in the presentation that is posted on our website. This detail follows the format that we laid out in our JPMorgan presentation earlier this month, and we intend to provide the same data each quarter going forward. We hope you find it useful to better understand our business, and for modeling purposes. Now on to divisional revenue. In diagnostics, sales were $304.1 million in the first quarter, up 6.4% % as reported, or 7.4% on a constant currency basis. This increase was driven by a 26.3% increase in global blood screening revenue from our partner Grifols, mainly from new business with the Japanese Red Cross, as well as additional ordering by Grifols to normalize their inventory levels. In the United States, revenue continued to decline at a mid-single-digit rate, primarily based on lower blood donation levels and ongoing efforts to manage blood usage. The improvements in our diagnostics business extended well beyond blood screening in the quarter. For example, our molecular diagnostic business was up a reported 5.6% and 6.2% in constant currency, mainly from increased usage of Aptima women\u2019s health assays on our fully automated Panther instrument system. Another important contributor to our quarterly performance in diagnostics was an improvement in our ThinPrep liquid cytology franchise. Specifically, revenue from cytology and perinatal products declined by only 1.2% on a reported basis, and were actually up 0.5% in constant currency. We attribute this to better sales execution and focus, market share gains, and perhaps some improvement in the macro environment. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that we are not calling a bottom to this market, and we expect sales to continue falling, although at a slower rate of decline than in previous quarters. Moving over to our Breast Health division, sales were $242 million, up 6.9% as reported, or 8.2% on a constant currency basis. This was primarily driven by an increase in breast imaging revenue, which was up a reported 10.9%, and 12.3% in constant currency, as customers continued to adopt Hologic 3D mammography. This was partially offset by breast intervention revenue, which declined a reported 2.3%, or 1.6% in constant currency. Overall, we are excited about the progress we are making with our Genius 3D product, and we have only just begun to penetrate the addressable market. We are often asked about the effect that a new competitor is having in the U.S. breast tomosynthesis market. While it's still early days, I can tell you that we are winning more than our fair share so far, and expect that to continue over time. We believe our success is based on a better product profile; that is, a superior FDA-approved indication, an impressive array of data on improved clinical outcomes, and product advantages such as faster scan times. Shifting to the GYN surgical division, sales were $84.4 million, up 7% as reported or 7.9% on a constant currency basis. This was driven by MyoSure, as revenue increased a reported 27.4 %, or 27.9% in constant currency. Quarterly sales of NovaSure systems also increased 0.1%, or 1.2% in constant currency, the first time this business has grown in a number of years, and a significant improvement compared to the declines seen in recent quarters. To round out the revenue discussion, let me mention that in skeletal health, sales were $22.3 million, up 4.5% as reported or 6.1% on a constant currency basis. Growth in the quarter was driven in part by our new Horizon bone densitometry scanner. Now let me turn to expenses and profitability. As Steve said, and as our guidance implies, our goal is to grow earnings faster than revenues. Although this won\u2019t happen every quarter due to the timing of expenses and various other puts and takes, we did demonstrate good leverage in the first quarter. More specifically, non-GAAP earnings per share of 39 cents grew 15.4%, more than double our reported revenue growth even though the stronger dollar reduced our reported EPS by about a penny. Nonetheless, we exceeded the guidance we provided in November. Non-GAAP gross margin was basically flat in the first quarter at 63.3%, as improvements in product mix and operational efficiencies offset the stronger dollar and continued pressure on price. Non-GAAP total operating expenses of $198.5 million increased by only 1.2 %, a significantly lower rate of increase than revenues. Non-GAAP research and development expenses increased, mainly due to a ramp up in diagnostics product development. As we have said before, revitalizing the Company\u2019s R&D pipelines will be an important strategy to generate sustainable, organic growth. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses also increased, mainly due to increased promotional activities in Breast Health around 3D mammography. But in non-GAAP general and administrative expenses declined, mainly due to lower external advisory fees, and we will continue to look to this line of the income statement for operating leverage. This all led to non-GAAP net income of $111.6 million, an increase of 18.6%. Net income benefited from our continued efforts to pay down debt. 7. Now I\u2019d like to turn to our updated financial guidance for the full fiscal year and next quarter. Based on our strong performance in the first quarter, we are raising our guidance. Please note that this guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates, with the understanding that currency has become a significant headwind for us and other multinational companies. I\u2019m going to cover a lot of numbers in this discussion, so I\u2019d encourage you to refer to our press release for clarity. For the 2015 fiscal year, and on a reported basis, we now expect total revenues of $2.57 to $2.60 billion. Compared to the prior year, this equates to reported revenue growth between 2.4% and 3.6 %, and constant currency growth between 4.4% and 5.6%. Still on the full year, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.54 and $1.57. This translates to reported earnings growth of between 5.5% and 7.5%, or 9% to 11 % on a constant currency basis. Let me emphasize that even in the short time since we gave our initial 2015 guidance in November, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly. So compared to three months ago, the full-year guidance we are providing today incorporates an incremental revenue headwind of roughly $25 million due to foreign exchange, and an EPS headwind of roughly $0.02 over and above our initial guidance. Said another way, if foreign exchange rates had not moved since early November, the updated guidance we\u2019re providing today would have been $25 million higher in revenue, and $0.02 higher in EPS. Now let\u2019s turn to guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. We now expect total revenues of $640 million to $650 million for the quarter. Compared to the prior year period, this guidance reflects reported revenue growth of 2.4% to 4.0 %, and constant currency growth of 4.5% to 6.1%. We also anticipate diluted, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.39 in the second quarter. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow 2.7% to 5.4% on a reported basis, or roughly 5.5% to 8% on a constant currency basis. Finally, I would like to conclude my remarks by reiterating that reducing debt remains one of the company\u2019s top priorities. In the first quarter, we voluntarily prepaid $300 million of our Term Loan B facility. Our leverage ratio is now down to 3.8, based on net debt of approximately $3.5 billion and trailing 12 months EBITDA of $924 million. Our goal remains to reduce this ratio to 2.5 times by the end of fiscal 2017. In addition, return on invested capital remains an important performance metric for driving shareholder value, and it therefore weighs heavily on executive compensation. Adjusted ROIC for the 12 months ended in December was 9.7%, up from 8.2% a year ago. All in all, we are pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, but still see many opportunities for continued improvement as we continue down the path of building a company that can be counted on for sustainable organic growth. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call up for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Hi Isaac. Isaac Ro : I just want to start with ThinPrep, it was certainly encouraging to hear the improvement there sequentially in absolute. Maybe if you could talk a little bit more about how you achieved that and the specifics around how you plan to sustain that improvement going forward? Steve MacMillan : Sure Isaac, I think to a large degree our team has refocused the sales team are not just giving up and just accepting the declines and I think this is one of those classic scenarios of putting some more energy behind it. I will say Eric Compton, our COO has started a \u201cWe love ThinPrep\u201d speech within the company and things like that are getting everybody reengaged in what is still a tremendously great product. So I think we're slowing it in the U.S. and we're seeing opportunities outside the U.S. and I think we're certainly more confident that the steepest declines are behind us. We don't want to get out in front of ourselves in terms of being too far ahead on the market, but I think we're feeling certainly the most definitive that that rate of decline is halting. Isaac Ro : Got it. That's helpful and then on Breast Health, you mentioned the market share opportunity for tomo being attractive here. Just talk a little bit about how that compares U.S. versus international? I tend to think of the international market as being a little tougher just given the nature of the competition, but curious how you're thinking about the competitive landscape in tomo U.S. versus ex-U.S.? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Yes. Thank you. We're actually encouraged on both fronts. Clearly a lot of momentum in the U.S. right now with the JAMA study, the incremental reimbursement and just our overall position. But I would even tell you the JAMA study I think has given new life to our teams outside the United States and it's gotten a lot of pick up on a global basis and we did see a pickup and a meaningful pickup internationally in the quarter. And I think as our new leader Claus Egstrand internationally is reengaging a lot of the folks there. I think we're actually probably more encouraged about the opportunities outside the U.S. than I would have been three or six months ago. Bob McMahon : Yes, hey. Isaac, this is Bob, just to add on to that. I think one of the things that I think really encourages us about the O.U.S. is not only just tomosynthesis, but also our 2D opportunity and that's one thing where I think there is a whole untapped opportunity of actually converting analogue 2D and that ultimately form 2D to 3D. There are many more analogue systems outside the U.S. and rather than trying to convince them to convert right to 3D, we're also looking at taking our leading technologies in 2D and converting their as well. Operator : We'll go next to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey thanks. Just looking at some of the businesses that have turned here, particular NovaSure and Skeletal Health, can you just maybe comment on how much of that growth was a function of new products versus maybe just revitalizing the sales force and changing combination with them? Steve MacMillan : Sure. Combinations Tycho, first we would be remiss if we didn't remind people those certainly were the easiest comps. Having said that, I think what you see in both businesses is revitalize sales force is really stable sales force. If you go back to we've told a few people that we had tremendous turnover in that surgical sales force really in 2013 and 2014. They've been settling down in a customer facing business very important. We're getting a little bit of new news coming through on the products, but it's really I would say a very strong sales execution story and the sales force is settling down being reengaged. Bob McMahon : Yes, I think just to build on that, we did launch the 6 millimeter that had an immaterial impact in the first quarter. we feel really good about that business going forward on the NovaSure but to build on Steve's point it was really about execution. In the Skeletal business, it is being driven by the horizon, which is a relatively new product. Tycho Peterson : And then just follow up, can you talk about expectations for Gen-Probe's molecular business? Part of your strategy is obviously to revitalize some of the growth and you have had some early success with viral load with HIV in Europe. Can you maybe just talk about where you are from an investment standpoint and how much you need to reinvest in Gen-Probe to get the molecular business growing again? Steve MacMillan : Sure. Certainly we're feeling good, by the way we're not yet seeing commercial impact from the HIV in Europe. I think that give us hope for the future in terms of what will be coming. I think the interesting part on that business has probably been missed is the growing panther placements that were occurring through last year, while everybody was focused on Quest and ultimately that Quest was going to anniversary, we're now beyond the Quest contract anniversary, but we're starting to see that growing freight train of strength from the Panthers. Now that -- to continue that, A, there is certainly some mileage ahead of us here, but to the second part of your question in terms of investment, we are revamping investment to really build out a stronger pipeline over time and that will be more years out, other than the viral load stuff that we have coming in the next few years first outside the U.S. and then still a couple of years away in terms of the U.S. But we feel right now again it's an execution story as we then start to put more on and then you will see additional investment in R&D here going forward. So we're both delivering, but also investing for the future. Operator : We'll go next to Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan : Hi thanks and good afternoon and thanks for all the additional detail on the presentation too. I just want to start with the updated guidance for 2015 making sure I have all the puts and takes rate, just trying to bridge the guidance. I would guess the term loan and the better first quarter performance reached $0.03 good guys and FX was a $0.02 headwind. Is there anything else in the remainder of the year that we need to keep an eye on just given the strength in the quarter. I might have thought that the full year guide might have come up a little bit higher? Steve MacMillan : I think in this environment with the dollar changing and everything else right now and keep in mind, we still had a softer comp. we feel very good about the direction of the business, but frankly to take the low end, the needed low end of our guidance was at the top end of the old. We think it's a very prudent way to go forward. Bob you want to add? Bob McMahon : Yes, I think just the other -- just for modeling purposes, $0.03 is too high on the interest rate. We actually prepaid that at the end of the quarter. So think about that more appropriately a little over -- or a little less than $0.02. So not the full $0.03 that you're talking about because we have three quarters of the year benefit there. Jack Meehan : Got it, that makes sense and is there any way to size the -- I guess just trying to figure out the strength and the blood screening business, what's the Japanese red cross versus the inventory level change was for Grifols'? Steve MacMillan : Yes, for one, that's kind of a hard number to come up to actually detail out what I would say a lot of product associated with the inventory levels is associated with the Japanese Red Cross. So, rather than looking at it as to specific entities what I would say is that growth is demand driven by the Japanese Red Cross and also increase in their inventories. We expect most of the inventory increase to be behind us now and no going forward will be primarily on the back of the Japanese Red Cross. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Doug Schenkel : Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Steve MacMillan : Sure Doug. Doug Schenkel : Actually, maybe just I guess another currency question, and actually wondering given you guys have talked for good reason about the opportunity that exists to get a bigger footprint internationally, just the strengthening of the dollar recognizing the balance sheet is getting a lot better but you are still a little bit stretched. Does the strengthening of the dollar at all give you any opportunity to get a little bit more optimistic in investing O U.S. to maybe accelerate some of the aspirations internationally? Steve MacMillan : Doug, we're not thinking about it quite that way. I think we're looking at the opportunity certainly as a longer-term and we are making the investments we need to. I don\u2019t think we're, frankly we don\u2019t want to throw bad money or good money after incomplete plans. And I would say the team is still in the early stages of putting together the best plans and maybe if we were at a different stage in our managerial cycle, we had a really experienced team that's been in place for five years, you might look a little more opportunistically, but I think given right now we're really looking at it strategically. Doug Schenkel : Okay that's helpful. And then going back to breast health, you began I think what you call the Genius consumer marketing campaign back in October. I'm just wondering if it's too early to tell how successful was that spend and if that is starting to play a role in helping uptake of 3D and maybe even at some level kind of fortifying the argument that hospital is going to get onboard with 3D otherwise you are going to risk losing volumes to other centers? Steve MacMillan : Yes, without directly quantifying it we've heard from a number of customers that probably said they had helped push them over the edge and I know we've got a number of hospitals now starting to actually use it and marketing it, you know marketing our product in their own efforts. So I think we're definitely feeling like it is not a catalyst. I think the simplest way to think about where we going on breast health right now is a bunch of things coming together. The JAMA study came out right, if you got back to the fall, JAMA comes out, we start marketing more, the positive reimbursement, frankly a competitor on the market were we think we've got and it is very clear we've got a superior label and we've got the clinical data and a team that feels very good and these things are really working together to generate certainly the double digit growth we had this quarter in the breast imaging and we feel very good about where that business is going. Operator : We'll go next to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : I have two questions, maybe Steve I'll start off with you and Bob I'll give you a change to tag team one. So, if you think about the balance sheet for a second, I guess, for Bob what are probabilities near term in terms of extinguishing some of this debt, where do you go first and why? And then Steve I wonder just give n the improving operating performance and obviously considering you've only been a little over a year but it's been a good year, what's the earliest timeframe in which you start considering M&A? And then I had a quick follow up. Steve MacMillan : Sure, well Bob starts\u2026 Bob McMahon : Yeah sure, so thanks David and obviously we just prepaid the $300 million on our term loan B. That was the most expeditious way to do it without any prepayments of penalties and so forth. So, we're looking at it across the spectrum overtime are looking at start picking off the various segments or sub-segments of our debt. What I would say is, we're looking at as you know, we have a fairly complex capital structure, debt structure with some converts and so forth some of those are in the money. Those are certainly some candidates that we would be looking to, to evaluate early extinguishment as well our or extinguishment when call date comes as well as some of the other activities around our 6.25 interest rate debt. So I would say we're going to be opportunistic, but do it in an economically NPV positive way. Steve MacMillan : And David, I'll pick up on the second part. As you think about the ability to start doing what we call some M&A and I would categorize it that the first steps will probably likely be tuck-in and I think about it in terms of capability, both financial capability as well as managerial capability. And I think we're still going to be a slight, call it, I wouldn't expect anything still in the next couple of quarters, but later in the year, next year, can we start to get to that position. I think what we wanted to do is financially we're getting stronger certainly, but the primary use is still going to be to pay down debt. Meanwhile getting the management team fully in place where we're smart enough to make the right bets when we do make them. And if you think back to some of our experiences at other companies, you want to be in the role long enough that you know you're making the best judgment, not just the first thing that comes along. And I think one of the real positives that's coming out of our improved performance is a company is suddenly just the amount of ideas coming to us in what I'd say the last 30, 60 days relative to ideas that came to us previously we now becoming much more viable partner for smaller companies that maybe looking to commercialize based on the success and frankly the quality of the team that we have over here now. So, I think yeah, we're starting to screen a lot more, but we'll probably still be a little ways away. David Lewis : Okay Steve, very helpful, thank you. Then Bob just a quick question, grow rate is obviously moving in the right direction. This notion that there is not significant margin opportunity in the business is a significant lesson debate. So I want to come back to the quarter here, very significant margin expansion in the quarter, so I want to kind of try to break it down into components. Does this reflect frankly just a stronger quarter than expected and you had greater drop through is because the issue is the quarterly margin performance is not really trending into the balance of the full year. So this is a better quarter than expected, was there some sense of conservatism as we're thinking about the guidance or Frankly there is just opportunities for new reinvestment that perhaps you weren\u2019t thinking about in November. So what were some of the factors for why that margin expansion in the quarter doesn't kind of pull forward to the year? Bob McMahon : Yeah, well, it is a combination of all, a little combination of all those factors David. So you know, obviously we were pleasantly surprised by the strength of the business in the first quarter that drove some of the margin expansion. We also had year-on-year improvement in our G&A areas associated with those onetime advisory costs that didn\u2019t materialize in this quarter. And then I think as we think about it going forward, there's two components, one is we are looking at opportunities for, to a certain extent some reinvestment work which is prudent and makes sense, but then also we're facing increasing headwinds around FX which will put pressure on our margins to a certain extent primarily around our gross margin and the predominance of our manufacturing is in the U.S. And so we're in total about0.05 is what we're estimating for the full year and incremental to since the last time we gave guidance. Only about a penny of that hit in the first quarter. So we still had about $0.04 of that incremental headwind to go. Operator : We'll go next to Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Richard Newitter : Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Steve, maybe I could start out on the OUS kind of transformation I know that you have been talking about since you've taken over. That's something that you identified right from the get-go as an area for significant improvement across all businesses. Maybe you could just provide a quick update on kind of what you've done so far, where you still have room to go through initiatives, how much is there internally left to do, and maybe piggybacking off of prior question, what could you do externally? Steve MacMillan : Sure, clearly all of our focus is on internal, let me take it in buckets. We started to see some upturn better performance certainly in our fourth fiscal quarter and that continued into this quarter. Now some of it is the Japan Red Cross. So I want to make sure we don't take full credit for what's happening there, but we are seeing the new leader Claus Egstrand has really taken a much more focused approach to the business paring back instead what we call the peanut butter analogy of going after all the countries. He's really focusing in the key franchises in the countries and reengaging our dealer network on the breast health side and has brought in some very good executives from the diagnostics world to really focus on diagnostics. He also has identified properly big opportunity for us and really getting the teams working and reengaged opportunity for us and really getting the teams working and reengage and it's really a lot of blocking and tackling, but given the enormous underdevelopment, shall we say in terms of where we are, his whole team has been we have the products and we just need to execute better, whereas I would say when I first arrived there was a lot of whining that we didn\u2019t have the right products. And you know we needed for example low-cost tomo and as Bob articulated earlier, one of the things Claus figured out is we don\u2019t necessarily need low cost tomo, we can still sell 2D in a lot of markets that still haven't moved from film. So, it's looking market by market at the opportunities. There is nothing sexy about it, but it's good hard work blocking and tackling, re-engaging. In terms of the second part of your question around deploying M&A, we will be looking, but it's not at all the primary driver. We think we've got so much runway with the products that we have, that probably not likely to be a huge near-term focus for us. Richard Newitter : That's very helpful and then just a quick one on the breast imaging side, you know maybe you could tell us now that GE is on the market, to the extent that you maybe teams and pitches were reengaged with GE heavy accounts, but now that they have something that the customers are starting to compare it to because there is a GE product, are you actually able to convert some of the GE accounts to Hologic to tomo or is most of the stress you are having within the existing Hologic accounts? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : I want to be very careful around how I say this, because you know me to be conservative. But I think the approval has probably been a much bigger net positive to us given the label that they got approved and the product they got approved considering they came three years late. Operator : We'll go next to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. David Clair : Hi good afternoon everybody. It is actually Dave Clair in for Bill. So the first question from me, I was hoping to get an update on the state of the Chinese adoption of any T-testing? And then is this going to be a national rollout in China or is it province by province? Steve MacMillan : We are very little into Asia. Our understanding is province by province and I think they are in very, very early stages. And it is definitely not going to be a national, it is not like the Japan Red Cross, you push a button and go. David Clair : Okay, and then you mentioned increasing Panther menu as a priority, so can you give us any color on potential pipeline assays there and any updates on viral load? Steve MacMillan : Yeah at this point we have publicly talked about viral load. We've got that coming first in Europe. Call it really next year for intents and purposes and then a year behind that to the U.S. and then the additional menu we've really been revamping and not prepared to talk about that at this point. Operator : We'll go next to Anthony Petrone with Jefferies Group. Anthony Petrone : Thanks and good afternoon. Maybe just a follow up there on clinical diagnostics in terms of the HIV viral load, do you have a plan to maybe launch that on Tigris as well and then may be just a high level comment on pricing and margin of that essay versus the existing portfolio? And then I have a follow on3D. Steve MacMillan : Sure, the HIV, we do not have plans to commercialize that on Tigris at this point. Panther is really the way of the future and that's where we're focused. We're not getting into specific pricing discussions on that. Anthony Petrone : Understood, and then just on 3D, maybe just an update on how you see the product cycle progressing from here and you have JAMA and the CPT code in place. Steve you gave some good statistics at J.P. Morgan about 1400 systems have been converted at the installed base. If you do the math it's been around 300 to 600 per year. Should we be forecasting sort of an acceleration in placements from that range? And then what is the opportunity just in terms of going after completing targets where all the comments from the GE launch here? Thanks again. Steve MacMillan : Sure Anthony. I think we continue to describe the 3D tomo adoption as a freight train more than a rocketship. I think that momentum building and you probably would expect to see an acceleration of the adoption from the last few years and that really should carry us here for at least a number of years based on where we stand right now in terms of a total of call it 12,000 or 13,000 installed opportunities in the United States and still where we are less than 15% of the market, so big opportunity here over the coming years. Now again, it's not all going to come in one year or two because of when people have installed and capital cycles and everything else. And, you know, frankly that gives us more confidence about the longer-term sustainability of our growth trajectory, but meanwhile we are certainly approaching it with a great sense of urgency. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Michael Matson : Thanks for taking my question. Steve MacMillan : Sure, hey Mike. Michael Matson : Hey, so just to take you back to your Stryker days Steve, I was going to ask a question about the capital spending environment. So, we've seen some signs of the capital spending at the healthcare facilities and hospitals is picking up and I was wondering if that was factoring into the strong growth you were seeing with your mammography business as well? Steve MacMillan : We think it's probably contributing Mike. You know that we'll credit the external environment for some of our growth as opposed to taking full credit for it. So certainly I think it has been modestly helpful to us and I also just think that in general the way that the clinical data the additional, I think what has really happened in the last three months probably more than anything is hospitals are recognizing 3D truly is the future. And that's probably driving it more than even the capital cycle, but the capital is certainly helping us a bit. Michael Matson : Okay thanks, and then just a follow up on the questions about the international business, just wondering if you could give us your view on how you sort of balance your progress in the developed markets like Europe and Japan versus the emerging markets, how big of an opportunity is there in the emerging markets and is that something we could see a benefit from in the near-term or is that going to be a longer-term story? Steve MacMillan : I call it a qualified balance approach. The interesting part is we do still have so much opportunity as you point out in the developed markets. We have gaping opportunities still in Europe, in Japan and China depending on which market you put that in. But we also are seeing some opportunities in Latin America and certainly some of the other Asian countries. So I think on an absolute dollar basis, we'll probably see a little bit more out of the developed markets, but certainly growth out of both and I think we're earlier stages in the emerging markets and we're still early stages on some of these pieces all over, but it should be coming over time here. I guess one of the benefits to kind of the strategy that we have and given the fact that we are so underdeveloped outside the U.S. in some of the developed markets as well is just that the margin pressure that you see in the emerging markets and that growth isn't near the same as in the developed markets. And so when we think about the difference in the U.S. and no OUS markets we still have some pressure there in terms of market, but not the effect that some companies that are going strictly after growth in emerging markets only. And so that's helping us in terms of the amount of investment and operating income growth as well. Operator : We'll go next to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and then maybe I'll just start off with one housekeeping question on the guidance rates. So if you're looking sort of the implied growth rates for the back half you just printed 8% Q1 sort of pointing out maybe midpoint or slightly above the mid singles the second quarter. So that implies sort of low singles for the back half and I was wondering was this sort of what caused the variance. I understand some of it is comp is this any particular segments I'm just curious what the assumptions were? Steve MacMillan : Sure, I think at a high level if you look at our guidance for the year now it is, call it mid single digit growth 4.5% to 5.5%. We think in this environment this year that will be pretty good performance. We obviously got a huge head start. We do start in the second half of the year starting to go up against a little bit better performance and that's why we keep, we want to point out that this first quarter was clearly against a very soft comp. But we don\u2019t want to be signaling a huge deceleration. What we're really saying is we feel good about the business, but it is not growing at the rate yet that we just posted this quarter. Vijay Kumar : Thanks Steve and maybe one for Bob. You know something that you mentioned caught my attention. Lower advisory fees and that sounds sort of its repetitive in nature, is that the way to read it or I am not sure how to read the comment? Bob McMahon : Yes, so there were some one-time cost associated with -- in our Q1 of '14 that wouldn't be replicated going forward. I think that helped us in our managing our G&A areas or actually G&A decline as I spoke about Vijay. I would expect to continue to have strong cost controls there, but not at the rate of decline that we saw in the first quarter? Steve MacMillan : Yes, Vijay just a little additional color. Recall we had a lot of activism in the stock and proxy, thoughts in everything else going on in the year ago quarter. Operator : We'll go next to Bill Bonello with Craig-Hallum. Bill Bonello : Hey, thanks a lot for taking my call. I wanted to revisit the notion of the so called investor debate over earnings power and just curious Bob now that you've been there for a while when you look across in the income statement, would love to get your thoughts. I know you're clear that you should be able to grow earnings faster than revenue, but I am wondering if you can give a little bit more color on some of the things that you've been able to identify as opportunities in particular. I know you guys just hired a new head of global supply chain and it sounds like maybe there are low hanging fruits there, but if you want to elaborate on that or other opportunities? Bob McMahon : Yes, I'll start at maybe the highest level and give you maybe some examples. So if we think about our gross margin, as I think about that going forward, what I think is we're going to generate operational efficiencies, but that's going to offset continued pressure and price some of the growth outside the U.S. And so you should think about that more as flattish. An example that some of those operational efficiencies would be things like sourcing or procurement. So one of the area that we've identified now bringing on our supply chain head is looking at across our entire network and footprint, how do we leverage the spend that we have more efficiently and so that would be a way of looking at our quite honestly the largest P&L line item that we have and driving a lot more savings out of the materials that go into our products. That's the way that we will be able to drive some efficiencies. In addition as we drive revenue, that's going to help with efficiencies in our existing footprint through just more throughput into the manufacturing facilities. So those are two big components of how we will continue to drive affiance there. I would expect it to have some modest operational leverage in the OpEx side. I would expect us to have R&D investments continuing to grow albeit not at a rate necessarily accelerate faster than sales, but certainly at the level of sales. Same with sales and marketing and then what I would look at is the G&A area is funding that growth and over time you would see some modest leverage in the operating. Where we will get the most leverage from a net income standpoint is through two elements. One is by paying down debt, re-interest rate, our interest expense will do down and certainly we believe that we have opportunities and our tax albeit longer term to drive that down and drive operating -- net income growth. Bill Bonello : Okay. That is very helpful and I have no related follow-up question. Steve MacMillan : All right. Thanks Bill. Operator : We will go next to Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian Weinstein : All right. Thanks for taking the questions. I know you talked about the Chinese once market, but in general are there any new budgets screening tenders out there that we should be thinking about and also can you just refresh us on the timeline for your contract with the American Red Cross. How long does that go? Steve MacMillan : Sure Brian. We obviously never want to comment on specific contracts or contractual timing for any single customer, especially by the way when that contract is between Grifols and as specifically we talk about the American Red Cross. We will tell you we had a long-term multifaceted collaboration with the American Red Cross and it does have many years left to run. So we feel very good about that. In terms of the first part of your question. The other tenders around the world, they come up all the time but nothing of this significance certainly of the JRC of the American Red Cross. So they are certainly the two biggies. Brian Weinstein : Got it and then with respect to the molecular diagnostics growth in the quarter, which was good, can you comment at all about specific assays that were driving that. Obviously Qiagen was out again today talking down some of their HPV growth. Are you seeing a pickup in HPV? Is it CT/NG, Trich? Is it across the Board? Where are you guys seeing the strength? Steve MacMillan : Yes certainly we would say HOV has been a big strength of ours also Trich. So we're seeing it across the Board. Effectively our portfolio there of women's health products, but HPV has been a tremendous driver for us. Bob McMahon : Yes, we believe that HPV we're gaining share significant gain share at the expense of them. So we feel good about all of our assays. All of our assays grew in the quarter. Mike Watts : Operator, I think we might have time for maybe two more questions. Operator : We'll go next to Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : Good afternoon, and thanks for squeezing me in. Steve MacMillan : Sure Jayson. Jayson Bedford : I had just a couple questions. Just on the 2Q guidance, historically this is a business that would have kind of a big fourth quarter, softer first quarter, and then increased sequentially throughout the year. I would argue last year the fourth quarter wasn't quite as big, but certainly the first quarter was much stronger. Yet your second quarter guidance implies a sequential decline. And so, I guess I realize that surgical is always down sequentially in this quarter, but I'm wondering why would revenue be down quarter on quarter? It seems like it's a little more than just FX. Bob McMahon : Well that actually is the biggest issue. I think what we feel good about is especially as you pointed out that fourth quarter to first quarter we think we're getting a much more established cadence here and I think frankly if it wasn\u2019t for FX, keep in mind it's moved fairly significantly here quarter -- last year to now and even last quarter to this quarter, we would probably be on the border of sequential growth continuing. Jayson Bedford : Okay. Bob McMahon : Okay. Just to give you a flavor we're expecting FX to double -- the impact to double in the second quarter versus the first quarter. You saw the dramatic strengthening of the dollar really in January of this year and so that's by far in a way the largest piece of that and we expect that to continue throughout the year. Steve MacMillan : And Jayson the one other piece we were slightly stronger as we pointed out just from some of the inventory stuff. So if that was normalized, I think what we were really seeing is an underlying trend of continuing to grow sequentially. Jayson Bedford : Okay. And as a quick follow-up, international growth was a lot faster than U.S. growth in the quarter. When you look at the geographical mix of the business for the rest of the year, is double-digit international growth sustainable on a constant currency basis for the year? Bob McMahon : Certainly the Japan Red Cross piece is helping us a lot there, that's our goal, we're not quite ready to declare the work at that level. Operator : We'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel. Jon Block : Great, and thank you for squeezing me in. I'll try to be brief, two quick ones. Steve, maybe the first one. If you could just talk the lay of the land, U.S. tomo several months post the reimbursement news what are you seeing in the field? In other words are you seeing maybe the sales cycle shortening with some of the additional visibility, and then also you cited a strong backlog at the end of September in U.S. Breast Health. What are you seeing at the end of the calendar year? Steve MacMillan : Sure. I think the -- I think we feel better from the field and I will tell you that we probably -- my own read was we took a slight step back when our friends got approved and then we showed up at RSNA and then we started to realize the full labeling in the offering and the team is I think feeling better than ever about what we can do in this marketplace with the product we have. So right now I think we're feeling far better, backlog we don't report on it quarterly, but continuing to be very good. Jon Block : Okay. And then I may have missed this earlier, but on the blood screening side you put up some big, big numbers and you referenced JRC, and I always realize there's going to be sort of ebbs and flows with big deals. But is there a way to think about normalized growth ex that impact, so in our models when we start thinking out when you lapped that deal, how the underlying growth may look more in that division? Thanks, guys. Steve MacMillan : Sure. I think we articulated it that on an annualized basis, the first year it was $20-ish million. So call it $20 million to $25 million. It was going to give us about a one percentage point boost for the total corporation for the year and then it anniversaries. And I think just the way we think about that, it's a little bit like the Quest deal and the molecular business in the U.S. where you can get a little bit of a boost, but then it's our jeep spilling that that and growing in the after math of that with anniversaries. So we're busy working with our partners Grifols right now to think about what's next. Operator : Thank you. And that is all the time we have question today. This now concludes Hologic's first quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. Have a good evening.",

My name is Holly, and I am your operator for today's conference. Please note, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Mike, you may ago ahead. Michael J. Watts: Thank you very much, Holly. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Hologic's Second Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today, then we'll have a question-and-answer session. If you didn't already see our second quarter press release, a copy is available in the Investor section of our website along with a supplemental financial presentation for today's call. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. And finally, a replay of the call will be archived on our website until May 29. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call may be forward looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our second quarter earnings release or in the supplemental presentation. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen P. MacMillan: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. We posted another strong quarter of top line growth with faster growth on the bottom line. As a company, we've come a long way in a short period of time, but we believe the transformation of Hologic is still in its early stages and that we can continue to improve many aspects of our performance. Now let's dive into the quarter. Compared to the prior year period, revenues of $655 million grew 4.9% on a reported basis and 7.2% on a constant-currency basis. Our growth was, once again, broad based in the quarter. For those of you who have seen the green red dashboard that we use internally, we're happy to report that all 4 of our businesses were comfortably in the green on the constant-currency basis as our commercial execution continues to improve. In addition to a stronger revenue story, we are generating gross and operating margin improvements, leading to good earnings leverage in the second quarter. Based on mid-single digit revenue growth, non-GAAP net income increased by 15.3%, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew by 10.8%. We generated this operating leverage while increasing our investments in future organic growth, especially in Diagnostics R&D and Breast Health marketing. We believe these kinds of intelligent, targeted investments are crucial to the long-term vibrancy of the company and are more productive use of capital than large-scale M&A transactions. Based on our results in the second quarter, we are again raising our financial guidance for the year. Bob will give you those details in a moment. But first, let me provide some strategic perspective on 3 areas that contributed to growth in the quarter : Genius 3D Mammography, cervical cancer diagnostics and our Surgical business. First, total Breast Health sales growth accelerated to 9.4% in the quarter on a constant-currency basis, a very good performance. Underpinning this, global sales of our breast imaging products, like Genius 3D Mammography systems, grew an even stronger 13.8%. We had a robust quarter of 3D placements and have now installed roughly 1,800 systems in the key U.S. market. While this is excellent progress, we are equally encouraged that we are still less than 25% penetrated into our existing customer base and less than 15% penetrated into the domestic market as a whole, providing significant opportunity for additional growth. There are many reasons for our recent success with 3D in the U.S., including the JAMA study, CMS reimbursement and a competitor entering the market with an inferior product profile. But another factor is the success of our Genius marketing campaign. More than a branding project, our comprehensive marketing efforts reflect Hologic's overall commitment to the space and to our customers. Radiologists know that by partnering with Hologic, they get a better product with better clinical outcomes. But they also get an online presence with patients, a sales force that educates OB/GYNs, reimbursement support and health economic analysis. All of these benefits help radiologist centers attract patients and build their businesses. This is the kind of customer alignment we were looking for when we revamped our commercial team in Breast Health, and it's gratifying to see their efforts paying off. We believe these efforts have clearly accelerated our performance. Before I leave Breast Health, let me mention that we are neither surprised nor concerned about the recent draft guidance issued by the U.S. preventive services task force. By focusing on older data, the task force underestimated the benefits that newer technologies, like 3D mammography, offer women. The good news is that our customers understand these benefits clearly, as evidenced by the immediate reaction of various medical societies and patient groups. Hologic will continue to have a key voice in these discussions, but we do not believe that any potential guidance changes will have a material effect on our business. Second, I want to highlight the progress we've made in cervical cancer Diagnostics. As you know, this is a highly competitive market, and we still face headwinds from the extension of Pap screening intervals. But despite these factors, our global cytology sales were basically flat this quarter on a constant-currency basis as domestic market share gains and international growth offset lengthening intervals. We have long been the #1 domestic player in liquid Pap testing, and we believe we are now #1 in U.S. HPV testing as well. Our leadership is based mainly on a strong combination and differentiated benefits of the Aptima HPV assay and automated instruments like Panther and TIGRIS. It's important to note that even as we have gained share in the HPV market, our pricing has remained relatively stable over the last several quarters. Before I move on, let me say that we were happy to see the publication a few weeks ago of Quest cervical cancer screening data. Quest study was probably the largest retrospective study ever in this field, encompassing roughly 8.6 million women and more than 500 confirmed cancer cases. The Quest study proved what Hologic has always believed, that co-testing with both Pap and HPV tests provides the best care for women. Specifically, the study showed that approximately 19% of women with confirmed cervical cancer received a negative test result from an HPV assay, and that co-testing provided a threefold improvement in the cancer detection rate compared to screening with HPV only. It's clear from the Quest study that both our main cervical cancer products can offer significant benefits for women's health as well as benefits to our shareholders. The third point I'd like to make relates to our Surgical business. As recently as a year ago, this business was declining at a consistent low single-digit rate, in part because of high turnover in our sales force. Today, we have a full motivated sales team and are even adding clinical resources to support them. As a result, global sales of our NovaSure product, which had been in steady decline, increased slightly in the second quarter on a constant-currency basis. Domestically, NovaSure even grew for the first time since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and sales growth of our newer MyoSure system accelerated to more than 30%, leading to overall surgical growth of nearly 12% on a constant-currency basis. Although this growth rate benefited from an easy prior year comparable, we're still immensely proud of the turnaround that our commercial team has engineered. So in summary, Hologic has come a long way in a short period of time. Our financial performance has improved more quickly than I ever imagined possible, and we're deeply grateful to our employees for that. In particular, a lot of credit goes to our commercial teams, especially in the United States, who have quickly stabilized declining franchises and begun to optimize our growth drivers. But as I said at the beginning of my remarks, we believe that the transformation of Hologic is still in its early stages, and that we can continue to improve many aspects of our performance. Our longer-term priorities remain the same as those we outlined at the JPMorgan conference earlier this year. We are defining organic innovation strategies for each of our businesses and identifying the resources needed to achieve our goals. We are building a high-performance organization, one where talented engaged employees, achieved what others believe is impossible. We are developing a long-term international growth and tax strategy, and we continue to pay down debt, both to improve our operational flexibility and to boost our earnings over the long term. In some of these areas, we haven't even begun to put points on the board yet. So while we've made good progress on the commercial front thus far, we have a lot to look forward to in the future as well. Now I will hand the call over to Bob to discuss the second quarter financials in more detail. Robert W. McMahon: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to discuss our second quarter results and then provide our updated financial guidance. Unless otherwise noted, all of my commentary will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. Let me begin by reiterating that we are very pleased with the commercial execution we are seeing across the business. This is the second quarter in a row when we've grown revenues faster than the 7% on a constant-currency basis, and this growth was again diversified across all 4 of our business lines. Based on a strong top line and despite the continued effects of currency, we grew EPS at a double-digit rate. Steve already commented on some of our revenue highlights, so I will discuss the other divisional sales drivers. Starting in Diagnostics. Sales were $296.7 million in the second quarter, up 2% as reported or 4.1% on a constant-currency basis. Like last quarter, blood screening revenues grew strongly, up 8.3% globally based on the new business our partner, Grifols, won with the Japanese Red Cross. As a reminder, this new contract will boost our third quarter results as well, but the growth benefit will annualize in our fourth quarter. Steve highlighted our strong performance in HPV testing, which contributed to overall molecular diagnostics sales of $119.7 million in the quarter, up 6.4% as reported and 7.9% on a constant-currency basis. Domestic molecular sales were particularly strong as use of our Aptima women's health assays continues to grow on our fully automated Panther system. We had a good quarter of Panther placements and are easily within reach of our year-end goal of 1,000 aggregate placements in diagnostics and blood screening combined. And equally important, we have a tremendous opportunity to increase pull through on these instruments with greater utilization and a growing menu of tests. Although revenue from cytology and perinatal declined by 5.2% on a reported basis, we're only down 1.5% in constant currency as declines in ThinPrep sales continue to moderate. Our assessment of the cytology market has not changed. While we still expect structural headwinds from lengthening cervical cancer screening intervals, we believe the year-over-year declines can largely be mitigated by domestic market share gains and international growth. Moving over to our Breast Health division. Sales were $255.5 million, up 7% as reported or 9.4% on a constant-currency basis. We are very pleased with the increase in breast imaging revenue, which was up a reported 11.4% and 13.8% in constant currency. Demand for Hologic 3D mammography continues to strengthen, in part due to our marketing efforts, as Steve noted. I won't repeat the details on our GYN surgical division, but I will say that Skeletal Health sales were $24.2 million, up 3.3% as reported or 8.1% on a constant-currency basis as growth was driven primarily by our new Horizon bone densitometry scanner. Now shifting over to expenses and profitability. We demonstrate a strong operating leverage in the quarter. On the bottom line, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.41 were ahead of our last guidance and up 10.8% versus the prior year. This increase was more than double our reported revenue growth despite increased share dilution as well as headwinds from a stronger dollar that reduced EPS by about $0.02 compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP gross margin was up 90 basis points in the second quarter at 63.4%. Benefits from strong domestic sales, product mix and operational efficiencies more than offset the stronger dollar. Non-GAAP total operating expenses of $195.9 million increased by 4.3%, slightly less than revenue growth. I want to make a further point here on the components of our study. As you have heard us say many times in the past, we are focused on creating sustainable organic growth for the long term. As a result, non-GAAP research and development expenses increased by 9.1% in the quarter, driven mainly by an increase in Diagnostics product development. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses increased 5.7%, mainly due to increased promotional activities in Breast Health around 3D mammography. Given our recent success in that area, we plan to increase our future investments in order to widen the competitive moat around our business. In contrast to these strategic investments, non-GAAP G&A expenses declined by 2.8% in the quarter. These savings helped fund increases in R&D in the commercial areas and help deliver operating leverage at the same time. Specifically, non-GAAP operating margin increased by 110 basis points to 33.5%. To round out the income statement, interest expense declined by 10.4% due to our continued progress in paying down debt. Our tax rate of 33.8% in the quarter was a little better than expected. And finally, our diluted share count increased by 4%, mainly because our share price exceeded the strike price on some of our convertible notes. Before I turn to our updated guidance, I want to highlight ROIC and a few items from our cash flow statement and balance sheet that illustrates how our operational and finance teams are working together to improve financial efficiency. During the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $158 million and have generated $311 million in the first half of the year. EBITDA was $239 million in the second quarter, up 7.3%, and $941 million for the last 12 months. This combination of strong cash flow and EBITDA improvement has allowed us to improve our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. This ratio now stands at 3.6, and we remain focused on reducing it further. In addition, ROIC was 10% in the quarter on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 170 basis points from the same period a year ago. In addition, accounts receivable decreased 3.8% and inventory declined by 9.8%. So good behind-the-scenes progress on multiple fronts. Now I'd like to turn to our updated financial guidance for the full fiscal year and the third quarter. Based on our strong performance in the second quarter, we are raising our guidance. This guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates with the understanding that currency remains a significant headwind for us and other multinational companies. I'm going to cover a lot of numbers in this discussions, so I would encourage you to refer to our press release for clarity. For the 2015 fiscal year and on a reported basis, we now expect total revenues of $2.60 billion to $2.62 billion. Compared to the prior year, this equates to reported revenue growth of between 3.6% and 4.4%, and constant-currency growth of between 5.8% and 6.6%. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for the full year of between $1.57 and $1.59. This translates to reported EPS growth between 7.5% and 8.9% or 11.6% to 13% on a constant-currency basis. Our increased EPS guidance incorporates some incremental investments both to accelerate and extend our growth prospects, especially in Breast Health and Diagnostics. It assumes a slightly lower tax rate of 34.25% for the full year, but a higher diluted share count of 289 million for the year due mainly to a higher share price making some of our convertible notes in the money. In addition, we are increasing guidance despite continued currency headwinds. Even since we provided guidance in January, the U.S. dollars has strengthened. So the full year guidance we are providing today incorporates an incremental revenue headwind of approximately $9 million due to foreign exchange and an EPS headwind of roughly $0.01 over our last guidance. Put another way, if foreign exchange rates did not move since January, the updated guidance we are providing today would have been about $9 million higher in revenue and $0.01 higher in EPS. Now let's focus on guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. We expect revenue between $645 million and $655 million for the quarter compared to the prior year period. This guidance reflects reported revenue growth of 2% to 3.5% and constant currency growth of 4.7% to 6.3%. So despite the fact that our comps are getting tougher, we are still projecting solid mid-single-digit growth on the top line for the third quarter. We anticipate that this revenue performance will drive diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.39 in the third quarter. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow 2.7% to 5.4% on a reported basis or roughly 8.1% to 10.8% on a constant-currency basis. Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying we are very pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter of our fiscal 2015. Our top line grew more than 7% on a constant-currency basis, and we showed significant leverage on the bottom line, aided by our ongoing efforts to boost efficiency and control cost. As a result, we are raising our financial guidance for the year with top line expected growth in the mid-single digits and bottom line growth comfortably in the double digits. As Steve said, the company had come a long way in a short period of time, but we're even more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Maybe my first one is for Steve. Since you've been here, a pretty remarkable turnaround. And if you look at the various moving elements, obviously, 3D is off in a terrific start. It looks like the NovaSure turnaround was particularly impressive. As we look at this company sort of on a medium-term basis, right, how should we think about Hologic from a medium-term perspective? Because clearly, I think on the tomo side, you have the opportunity, it's pretty much greenfield, and I think that 85% opportunity, that leaves you room for growth. I'm more wondering within Diagnostics, HPV just said your #1. Like you said, NovaSure and ThinPrep, it has taken time to turn around. So how should we think about the rest of the portfolio? And what else can you do to sort of firmly put the company on path to mid-single digit growth? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure, thanks, Vijay. We are very encouraged. Obviously, as you pointed out, I think, especially that 3D growth driver here now, our degree of confidence is higher than it's been in terms of really looking good for probably the next few years. We've got a superior product in that driving it. I think we are very encouraged, however, on some of the other piece of the business, you look, we said at the start, a little over a year ago, we wanted to stop the declines or slow the declines of the big franchises that were going down, which were especially ThinPrep and NovaSure. I feel very good that our sales focus in the United States, and then starting to look at opportunities outside the U.S. which will ultimately play out more over time, are seeing a visible change in the trajectory of ThinPrep. NovaSure as well, that one bouncing back to positive this quarter, feeling very good. I think what we're seeing is the sales team is really energized, reengaged. And we have leading products in markets that have probably a little bit more potential, still have some headwinds, but I think feeling better about all of the businesses. And the piece I throw in on HPV and really it's probably a broader comment on our molecular business is, I think, everybody was concerned, probably myself included, that once that Quest deal had rolled off and anniversary-ed, that molecular was going to be in for a rougher time period. I think what we've really seen is the incredible success of especially our U.S. molecular sales force that, while we were reaping the benefits of the Quest deal in '14, they were placing a lot of Panther's systems in the mid-sized labs and other labs, and that started to come through now for us, and I think really providing a little bit more of a positive growth engine for us. So I think we're feeling, especially short, medium term, feeling pretty good about the trajectory. Are we going to continue double-digit growth in Surgical? I don't think any of us could count on that, but mid-single-digit growth, I think we're feeling really good about. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Great, and maybe one for Bob. Bob, it looks like gross margin came in really strong, and part of this is mix. But as we think about sort of -- how should we think about the various moving parts, right, you have the mix, which is going in the positive direction, but I think what some people have point out was whether pricing pressure is within the Diagnostics piece, whether that could offset some of the gross margin benefit on the mix front. So could you just give us some color on how gross margin could play out? Robert W. McMahon: Yes. So obviously, with our performance on the top line, that's helping us with the factory pulling more products through that and continue to look at efficiencies there. To your point, though, around continued pressures, we do see that as well as we look longer term for international business to grow, we will see some downward pressure there. So I think the best way to look at that is we've been pleasantly surprised around our gross margin's better performance than last year. I don't see any reason that it will dramatically change from where it is first couple of quarters here for the rest of the year. And I think that we're going to continue to look for ways to drive efficiencies to offset some of those things that you're talking about. So I wouldn't project significant improvement there, but certainly, look for continued kind of that 63.5-ish range kind of flattish GP as we go through -- go forward. Operator : Our next question will come from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : So on ThinPrep, you guys mentioned, I think, constant currency down about 1% globally. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about the dispersion for that growth rate between the U.S. and ex-U.S., just given that you obviously still early days in growing the ex-U.S. business. I just want to get a sense of how it's doing. Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure, Isaac. Basically, we were down very low single digits in the U.S. So a much better trajectory than it was a year ago and very modest growth o-U.S. Yes, still the bulk of that business is still U.S. As we start to build that internationally over time we would hope that, that number will get a little bit better. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Sure, okay. And then as part of that, maybe thinking longer term, if you could help us get a sense of your action plan, I would say over the next 12 or 18 months to expand the ex-U.S. business just across all the portfolio items there. What kind of infrastructure do you think you need to add? I'm just trying to get a sense of your priorities operationally to get the ex-U.S. business going. Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure, it's a great question, Isaac. Because I would tell you we probably have more -- I'm not going to say rebuilding but actual building to do outside the U.S., particularly as you look at areas like molecular diagnostics and even our ThinPrep business in some of the growth markets that we've identified as well as our Surgical business. So there's a little more building, and I would say really as we're thinking about the business right now, is probably recognizing in the shorter term, we're probably going to get more growth out of the U.S. than we imagined. While the international piece is still going to be, as you talked 12, 18 months, this is still going to be a building process. We're making the investments. Claus Egstrand, our Head of International, has been revamping the team. We still have some muscle building to do on the international front, and I think we'll be continuing to do that over the next year to really set ourselves up for growth. We'll be growing in the meantime, but I think getting to a healthier growth rate probably in '17 and beyond, so I think we've got great carriers in that -- the short term in the U.S. and then international carrying us much more beyond that. Operator : Next, we'll go to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : So Steve, it doesn't come up very often but I think there's a pretty good opportunity for 2D in Europe. And maybe can you speak to that and kind of how you guys are trying to help monetize that business? And maybe kind of somewhat piggybacking off of Isaac's second question. Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. Good one, Bill. Frankly, we'd probably say we think there's an opportunity for 2D, not only in Europe but frankly, most markets outside the U.S., and it's been one of the first things that Claus and the team have identified as more of a growth opportunity. And ideally, we could get 2D systems in, it would be upgradable down the road. Again, a lot of those are tenders. There's a lot of even looking at our dealer network and getting in place to be able to even better compete. I'd say we compete really well in certain markets, but don't have the full global footprint and strength that we would like. And that will be a nice opportunity for us. There's still a lot of the world that's going from film to -- to try to get them to go from film all the way to 3D tomo is probably a step too far and it's part of what Claus has looked at and said, we got an opportunity to go stepwise, just as you've pointed out. So it is an area of greater focus for us. Robert W. McMahon: Let me just add, just to give you some perspective. Claus and team have really looked at, call it -- I'll call it top 10 focus markets. In those top 10 focus markets, there's approximately almost double the number of gantries that -- than there are in the U.S. So it talks about the opportunity. Now many of those gantries are still analog. And so Steve's point, transitioning from analog to 2D is the logical step with an upgradable feature that ultimately get to 3D as opposed to trying to leapfrog to a 3D. And so that's what Claus and his team are really focused on working to dealers. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Very good. And then just thinking, you're shifting a little bit to Diagnostics. Taking a look at the fusion system over the weekend, it looks like it could be very impactful in the clinical space certainly with the combination of TMA plus PCR. Candidly, Steve, it looked to us like a lot of the instrument development costs weren't even spent, so maybe you can speak to a little bit the investment and the timetable around the assay side of that. Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. We are very excited about what that would bring in terms of the instrumentation. On the assay side, we are early stages in terms of really starting to do the PCR work because, as you know, we've been a TMA shop and our team out in San Diego was really refocusing in building that up. I think we're still at least a few years away in terms of having a legitimate assay menu. We would be thinking '17 and beyond. So again, we're kind of viewing it as we think about longer term. We got some great growth drivers near term, and then started to think about things like that to be providing the medium longer-term growth. I wish we were sooner, by the way, but that's one of those things that had been -- the instrumentation work was well done, and we just haven't followed through on the assay work as much. Robert W. McMahon: And that's one of the areas, not necessarily just fusion, but when we talk about kind of the investment that we're making in the near term to fortify some of the longer-term activities. Our R&D investment, overall, grew 9% this year -- this quarter, and we would continue to expect to make investments, not only in fusion, but in the assay development portfolio, so that there would be a complement of not only TMA assays that we've talked about in the past, continuing in our virals, but then ultimately having a PCR complement as well. Operator : And our next question will come from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : So interesting commentary on HPV. Share shifts in that area continue to be a pretty notable, pretty material. You guys are clearly doing well, and there are some successes with some other companies out there as well. Kind of prompts the question, keeping in mind we've seen a lot of progress made in decentralization of molecular, even down to much smaller labs than you guys typically target, and keeping in mind that even Roche has made some investment in areas like lab in a tube systems. Just wondering if you have any updated thoughts on the need to further decentralize within your portfolio? And more specifically, any active efforts to develop anything lower volume in molecular testing? Stephen P. MacMillan: We really don't have much going on there, to be brutally candid, right now. We think there's still a lot of runway for Panther, but clearly that is one of the key questions we are asking ourselves now. But we don't -- we have not had an active program there. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then, I guess, this is topical for me because we attended a DxMA meeting earlier today here in Boston. There's a lot of focus on the outlook for increased adoption of nucleic acid testing in China. And some industry experts asserted that they expect adoption to be fairly quick, and again, relatively decentralized in key areas, including HPV, if not especially HPV. There's been a lot of focus on this call about your efforts to improve your positioning o-U.S. I was just wondering if you'd be willing to provide some color on how you feel you're positioned to capitalize on this opportunity in China and what additional investment, strategic collaborations or, I guess, what role bolt-ons might fit in the context of assessing the outlook for that market? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure, I think we feel reasonably good about our position in China, particularly as it relates to ThinPrep. We've been doing a pretty nice job there. On the rest of the businesses, we have opportunities. Grifols, our partner, obviously as it relates to the NAT testing and the blood piece, we feel good about Grifols presence and our partnership with them. I would say that I think that piece is going to continue to roll out slower rather than faster. We'd rather be pleasantly surprised if the market develops, so I'd say we're positioned there pretty well. But probably not ready to count on explosive market growth. It's a very decentralized decision-making process. It's not like in Japan, where we got the Japan Red Cross and you get the whole country overnight. China is going to be region by region. So I think we feel good about our position there. On any of the markets outside the U.S., I'd put it as best as good, not great, but with a trajectory of getting better. We feel really good. We brought in a new leader of our China business a little over a year ago, a very experienced leader, doing a great job there and very well tapped into the market. Operator : Next, we'll hear from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Bob, Steve, came from a company where the ROIC was much more elevated than Hologic's. And I appreciate you talking about ROIC here and your commitment to it. So I guess the question is, what's an appropriate ROIC for this business? How long does it take to get there? And what is the intermediate target you aspire to? And I have a quick follow-up. Robert W. McMahon: Yes, thanks, Dave. What I would say is, we're not in a position to project a specific target. But I would say is, we're aiming for higher than it is. But to your point, I mean, I think one of the things that we are benefiting from is a very strong cash flow. And this actually is a pretty efficient -- when the assets are utilized, I think more appropriately, a pretty efficient engine. And to the effect that we can actually drive 170 basis points of ROIC in a year, it speaks pretty well to kind of what we're trying to do going forward. Not to say that it's going to be 170 basis points every quarter -- or every year, excuse me, but we need to improve our return on our capital. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay, very clear and fair. And then Steve, obviously, last quarter, we didn't see a dramatic amount of tomo upside versus consensus. This quarter, the highlights obviously is tomo upside. Backlog last quarter was very strong. Can you just comment qualitatively on the backlog you saw sequentially from last quarter to this quarter? Stephen P. MacMillan: Yes, it's continuing to get even better, David. It's part of what gives us a lot of confidence in the shorter term going forward. The orders really for the last few quarters really looking strong in the U.S. Operator : Our next question will come from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Maybe one on ThinPrep. Can you maybe give us a sense of what the tailwind could be from the Quest study? And how long that will take to resonate among OB\\GYNs? And then a follow-up there would just be on ThinPrep pricing. The company still has a dominant share position there. Do you envision at all potentially a price reset on ThinPrep down the road? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure, why don't I start. On the Quest data, we're obviously seeing that getting out into the press. I think what we're going to see in the world of HPV and cervical cancer screening, I think, over the next few years, is you're going to have a lot of different data points and a lot of different messaging out there between HPV primary, co-testing, various messages and probably some ebbs and flows in the data. I do think where we feel very good about is when you really start to peel down, we think the science, the long-term science is on our side. As it relates to co-testing is, by far, going to be the superior outcome. We love the way we're positioned there. And by the way, at the end of the day, it's pretty inexpensive testing to test -- co-test versus single test in this space. On your second part of the question. The AUP for ThinPrep is really been flattening and our goal is to try to keep that as flat as we can. Bob? Robert W. McMahon: Yes, I'll just say if it goes up, we will be pleasantly surprised. Operator : Our next question will come from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I just wanted to ask about 3D in other way and maybe just any color commentary on the pacing of the placements throughout the quarter? And then just with the investments you're making in marketing and the higher outlook, what should our expectations be sort of on the ramp through the end of the year? Stephen P. MacMillan: Yes. I think we just feel good about the trajectory, Jack. And like what we're seeing in orders, like what we're seeing in placements, and think we've seen a little bit of an uptick this quarter that's probably likely to continue here. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, got it... Stephen P. MacMillan: I wouldn't expect it accelerating beyond where we are. This is pretty big move up, and we're going to start going to go into much tougher comps and all of that. But I think we feel -- it's a pretty robust business. Robert W. McMahon: And I think -- yes, the one thing, Jack, on the phasing during the quarter because of the strength that Steve just talked about, we're seeing that in each one of the quarter -- each one of the months continue build working with our -- with the radiologists centers, the hospitals, our customers to place things. And so we're not seeing this huge hockey stick over in the last 2 or 3 weeks of the month -- or of the quarter. We're feeling really good about that business throughout the quarter. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Got it. Yes, that makes sense. And then, is there a way just to frame just the margin improvement in the quarter, how much -- and I know you mentioned Breast Health was favorable within that? Just how much of a contribution that was to the overall total? Robert W. McMahon: Can you repeat the question, Jack? Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just looking at the improvement in gross margin for the overall company in the quarter, just breaking out within that, how Breast Health is? Robert W. McMahon: Yes, well, I'm not going to get into all the components of detail. What I would say is our Breast Health business gross margin didn't improve appreciably as we are moving to more 3D as you would expect. Our 3D instrumentation has a better gross margin than our 2D. And as we shift principally in the U.S., we're enjoying the benefits of that. We're also driving some cost efficiencies on the actuals service side, which is also helping the breast business have the large piece. So our service business continues to grow at a nice clip, and we're able to manage some of the cost side as well that's helping our gross margin. Operator : Our next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I want to go back to kind of some of the question earlier just about the sustainability of the momentum of the business. And I guess on the R&D spending, can you talk to the degree to which maybe you're pulling forward some incremental R&D? And it sounds like we should assume maybe a similar run rate to what we saw this quarter going forward? And then secondarily to that, you haven't commented on M&A last quarter, Steve, you did say, maybe you'll be looking at deals before the end of this year. So I'm just wondering, if you could comment on the opportunity set, gaps in the portfolio, any ROIC hurdles, things like that as you're looking at potential tuck-ins? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure, Tycho. I'll start, and Bob's want to build on that. I think on the R&D front, I wouldn't say we're pulling stuff forward. What we are doing is really revamping the pipeline. If you think about what we had become a little bit as a company, was one that was driven a little bit more by inorganic growth. And so a lot of what we're doing is going back to what really made us great in the early 2000s, and frankly, what have made our legacy companies really great, which was more organic innovation. And I would say we're really rebuilding that DNA in the organization. So we're ramping up the spend and ramping up the capabilities, much of which really won't come through for another few years. So I think at the highest level, the way we're thinking about the company right now is we probably got a short-term pipeline gap. The positive is we got so much opportunity, some great products in the short term to carry us while we get the R&D piece put together. As it does relates to M&A, that will be another way to kind of continue to grow. Our teams candidly because we've got so many new folks, and we've been so focused on executing, I think we're probably still a little further out on the M&A front. And I probably almost would not expect much, if anything, this year. And when we do look at it, it's going to be about looking at things that can help us grow organically once they're brought in to the organization. And probably more what we have said will be tuck-ins. We will be looking at ROIC as well as accretion dilution, but very much focus on ROIC and on growth drivers to supplement what we, frankly, are building with incredibly strong commercial teams. Robert W. McMahon: Yes, just to build on that. I think -- just to build on that for the R&D question, I think we're probably looking at the third quarter as being one of the biggest R&D spending for the year. We're taking the opportunity as we are probably a little ahead of where we initially had thought on the top line to take some of those investments, not only in R&D but in some marketing. I would say longer term, I wouldn't expect the continued 9% multiple years out, but certainly, we're taking the opportunity to do that. I still think and we've talked about improving R&D productivity, and that's still a core attribute that we're working through right now and actually getting more out with the dollars that we spend. But given that we have some opportunities in the short term, we certainly are building some of those capabilities that Steve talked about. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And Steve, one of the earlier things you highlighted when you first came on was potentially the opportunity to take price increases. Can you maybe just talk about the pricing environment? Where are you in the process of potential repricing the portfolio? And maybe also specifically talk about mammography now that you got GE and Siemens coming in the 3D market, what are the pricing dynamics like? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. I'm not sure if I ever really said we'd be taking price increases, but that just we are going to be much more focused on being able to pay attention to pricing. And I think it's probably more not doing deep discounting, which, by definition, is helping us on the realized ASP. And frankly, I give both Bob McMahon and then Eric Compton, our COO, and Claus Egstrand, our Head of International, a lot of credit for starting to put much more rigor and discipline into what effectively and largely been a lot of deep discounting at end of quarters that we're getting rid off. And having said that, on the positive side, we have been able to put through a little bit of a modest price increase in our Surgical business, and we're looking at it kind of the both ways. We're looking at how do we minimize the erosion of discounting and where there are opportunities to take a little price starting to do that. Also, we keep nibbling on the edges here and fundamentally changing the trajectory. As it relates specifically to last piece of your question, Tycho, on mammography, we are seeing certainly our competitors being more aggressive on pricing. We're doing pretty good job in trying to hold the line. We think we got a superior product and don't want to get caught into a deep discount game with a competitor. Robert W. McMahon: Yes, just to build on that, I mean, just to give you kind of frame or reference with the way you look at some of our major projects. Steve talked about it in his prepared remarks, HPV has been -- that pricing has been steady for several quarters. Same with CT/GC, and we talked about ThinPrep as well. And so we're seeing that moderation of that the pricing decline, which we have seen in the past. And I think that's through a lot of the hard efforts and really focusing on price realization and value realization in the market. And to the point around 3D, our pricing per gantry is flat year-over-year, despite the entrance of a new competitor. Operator : And next from UBS, we'll hear from Jon Groberg. Jonathan P. Groberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So obviously you don't give the exact numbers, but it looks like you're close to a quarterly record in tomo. And I'm just curious, you mentioned you're pretty confident despite the U.S. USPSTF recommendations, you didn't really expect a slowdown there. Can you maybe expand on that just a little bit. We've got a lot of questions once those recommendations came out. Stephen P. MacMillan: Yes, as it relates to the USPSTF, first and foremost, they've used a lot of old data. We would also remind you that they're putting it out for guidance. It's still to -- it's in the question basically the public comment period. But at the end of the day, I think we have so many radiologists, so much of the medical community. If you look at ACOG, the America Society of Radiologist, AMA, everybody is looking at, frankly, the more recent data and things like the JAMA study and everything else as well as their own clinical experience. And I think we all know, frankly, women who, if they had waited and followed those guidelines, would not be with us today, people in our own families. And I think those guidelines are pretty far out in terms of what is doing the right thing for human health, and frankly, very small cost to the total system. So I think the users of our equipment, and frankly, if you look at so many in the patient advocate groups and everything else, again, we feel pretty good that they're ultimately all on the same side of better science and a better product, and we happen to be in that space. And for those of you who know me for a long time, no, I'm not one to be dismissive of any potential hurdle on the horizon, and take these any hurdle as very serious. But again, I think we feel really good about our ability to work through this one. Jonathan P. Groberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Just to be clear, it was view that regardless of -- I just want to be clear. It is your view that kind of regardless of what the ultimate final recommendation is that you don't think your business will be impacted? Or is it your view that when the final recommendations come in, the 3D will have kind of rightful place in those guidelines? Stephen P. MacMillan: Regardless of how they come in, we feel fine. Operator : Our next question will come from Bill Bonello with Craig-Hallum. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division : I just wanted to follow up a little bit on your response to Bill Quirk's question about the molecular business, and you talked about some of the longer-term things, the PCR opportunities being off a few years, but you feel very good that the near-term growth prospects, nonetheless. Can you just maybe elaborate a bit more on what those drivers are? If it's more of the customers using more of the assays? Maybe if everybody was using all of the tests that are out there today, how much of a growth opportunities is that just across your installed base? Just something to frame the opportunity within the existing assay base. Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure, Bill. I probably won't give you the numerics that you would like from a modeling standpoint but I'll give you just at a high level. The Panther placements, each time we're placing a Panther, what we love is that's going in today, it starts to come up to speed, there's usually a ramp to that, just as they -- they don't even necessarily go with our full menu upfront, some do, some don't. But oftentimes, they'll go in using just a few of our assays, and then our ability to keep expanding just our existing -- from the existing menu that we have. And then as we add menu over time, so that the utilization of those will continue to build out. But I'd say the core right now is really continued Panther placements. So each of one of these we place today is an annuity down the road and an annuity that will grow as the menu grows. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division : So the growth opportunity right now is still more just getting more hospitals to have to have labs, to have a Panther than it is that you've got a bunch of systems out there that are maybe just doing CT/NG or just doing HPV but not necessarily doing everything? Stephen P. MacMillan: It's really a bit of both. We have opportunity to improve the utilization of the ones we have placed, and we see additional opportunities for more placements. And to get more granular than that, if I've learned anything from our own forecasting, I know it's always hard for you guys to do models, is no matter what we forecast, the numbers always come out a little differently. And so to stress one over the other, at this point, I think we'd really see opportunities in both. Operator : Our next question will come from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Ravi Misra - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : This is Ravi in for Rich. I had one question on the backlog comments that you had made on tomo. In terms of the backlog getting even better in the U.S., are you still sort of winning on existing accounts or do we take that commentary to mean that you're making sort of competitive inroads? And then I have a follow-up. Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. Most of it is still on our existing accounts. As the market leader, we have the most on the existing accounts, and those are the ones, but we are getting the certain wins here and there competitively. The way I think about this market overall is it's probably fairly sticky at all directions, which is beneficial certainly to us, but we are definitely getting some competitive wins in there as well. Ravi Misra - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : And then maybe on MyoSure, that put up another pretty fantastic quarter. Could you may be tease out some of the impacts that you're seeing in the market, if any, from the morcellator warning, the black box issue? Stephen P. MacMillan: I don't think we really see any impact there, given that that's much more of a laparoscopic morcellation issue and really does not affect our business. We're not indicated to win from that. We're also not hurt by the negatives, nor is anybody that's doing laparoscopic morcellation going to shift over to hysteroscopic morcellation. So they're really 2 independent events. I think really what we're seeing driving our business is we've added some clinical specialist, our sales teams fired up, and we've got a lot of good things going out there. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Just a question on your comment about Breast Health marketing programs and increasing the investment there. You talked a little bit on the prepared remarks. But can you talk about examples where you're going to be increasing the spending? And some of the examples where you've seen some good success? Stephen P. MacMillan: Sure. On a high level, Brian, effectively what Pete Valenti, the President of our Breast Health business, as he came in, we've really ramped up the marketing programs, which is really co-marketing with hospitals. And the analogy I draw a little bit is, I think, a lot of the great work intuitive surgical did over the years. We're now both helping hospitals market the procedure, and I think they are feeling in markets, as hospitals start to advertise, it's creating demand from the other hospitals, not in the market. We also are doing a lot of kind of [indiscernible] over the web kind of stuff and using hospital locators and just a lot of I think very smart marketing that our team has developed. It's a competency we did not have in this company 12 months ago, and the team has really put it together and put a great program behind the Genius campaign. Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. And then I might have missed it. But did you guys give what the CT/GC growth was in the quarter? And if not, is it something that you can please provide? Stephen P. MacMillan: Yes, we did not. It's low single-digits global. Robert W. McMahon: Brian, molecular, as a whole, was about -- was up about 8% on a constant-currency basis. Stephen P. MacMillan: With the U.S. growing faster. Operator : Our final question will come from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Just a quick one and then a follow-up. You mentioned a little earlier, I think it was in reference to Breast Health, that you don't expect to see an acceleration from current levels. Just to get a little context, were you referring to the 9.5% Breast Health growth you saw in the quarter? Or was it more related to 3D specifically? Stephen P. MacMillan: I'd say the overall number. Yes, we're going to be starting to go up against bigger comps. We feel really good about the basic trajectory of that business, but it's going to be a very solid grower. Demand is very strong, but we probably don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves either. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And just as a follow-up on the Breast Health. Obviously, it's tough to poke holes in this quarter, but I guess the one area of softness looked to be international Breast Health, down 2% year-over-year. Can you just give us a little bit more detail as to why that was down? Whether it will be -- it didn't sound like pricing, was it just sluggish capital? Robert W. McMahon: You can bet, we've poked a lot more than you will on that internal. I would actually say it's 2 things. One is our International business is actually disproportionately affected by the AG high-tech some of the discontinued items from a year ago that are actually still in there. And if you actually take that out, but we don't allow our businesses to do that, it actually grew very modestly in the quarter. The other piece I'd say just in a higher level is there is some lumpiness that happened with the distributors. And I think any quarter-to-quarter variations, we'll probably still see a little bit more of that internationally. And if one quarter pops up really good, and then the next one is down, neither one is yet a trend. It's going to be watching it over time. So I think we feel good about where we're headed, but that is probably the -- actually on our red green charts, that was our only red out of 15 data points that we track. So you found it, good job. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. This now does conclude Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call. Have a great evening.",

Good afternoon. And welcome to the Hologic Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Don, and I am your operator for today's conference. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call. Mike Watts : Thank you, Don. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today then we'll have a question-and-answer session. If you didn't already see our third quarter press release, a copy is available in the Investor section of our website along with a supplemental financial presentation for today's call. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived on our website through August 28. Before we start, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call maybe forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement, included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release or in the supplemental presentation. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Steve MacMillan : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We\u2019re very pleased to discuss Hologic\u2019s financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. We\u2019ll frame these results today in the context of our annual strategic planning process, which we recently completed. To give away the punch line, we had an extremely strong quarter. We posted double-digit revenue growth both domestically and internationally on a constant currency basis, with 12.2% topline growth overall. Our Breast Health business led the charge, as expected, but our Diagnostics and Surgical businesses contributed significantly as well, so the strength was again broad-based. In fact, in the important U.S. market, every business grew as fast or faster than last quarter, with total domestic revenues up a very strong 12.7%. Equally encouraging, the growth and stabilization of some of our key franchises in the United States, combined with solid pricing discipline and early returns from our productivity initiatives, led to very strong gross margins, 65.2% on a non-GAAP basis. This drove a material improvement in our operating margin and a 16.2% increase in diluted earnings per share even as we made significant investments in our commercial activities. Based on all these factors, we are again raising our financial guidance for fiscal 2015, reflecting confidence in the sustainability of our results. In fact, sustainable growth was the focus of our annual strategic planning process, which we completed this quarter. While we can\u2019t provide all the details of our strategic plan, I would like to give you a little color on how we\u2019re thinking about the business at a high level. Shortly after I joined the company in late 2013, we made four strategic choices that have driven our turnaround thus far. First, we decided to keep the company essentially intact, but try to run it better. While we divested some small businesses, we believed then and continue to believe now that we can create the most value for our shareholders by optimizing the outstanding product and service assets that we have. Second, we recognized the need for a major overhaul of our leadership, our structure and our culture. We are focusing relentlessly on upgrading talent and increasing engagement, and have boosted accountability and performance in part by moving to a divisional structure. Third, we wanted to grow organically, rather than relying on acquisitions as we had in the past. We have doubled down on our key brands, stabilized previous sales declines, and in some cases returned these products to growth. And fourth, closely connected to our focus on organic growth, we have overhauled our approach to capital allocation by reducing and restructuring debt, and increasing return on invested capital. The positive results of these strategic choices were clearly reflected in our financial performance this quarter. Now let\u2019s discuss those results in more detail. I will take you through revenue then Bob will focus on expenses and the balance sheet. Compared to the prior year period, third quarter revenues of $693.9 million grew 12.2% on a constant currency basis. Breast Health was the clear growth standout in the quarter, driven by accelerating uptake of our Genius 3D mammography systems. Total Breast Health sales were $279.5 million, up 20.2% in constant currency. Digging a little deeper, breast imaging sales significantly exceeded our expectations, growing 24.2% in constant currency terms. We should point out that imaging sales included about $5 million of non-recurring revenue related to our divested Sentinelle business. But even without this, sales were exceptionally strong. We shipped a record number of 3D tomosynthesis units to domestic customers in the quarter and are encouraged to see a substantial runway still ahead of us. As expected, most of the new placements replace our existing 2D systems, but we are winning competitive business as well. As we discussed last quarter, our Genius 3D marketing efforts are making a difference and some of you may have seen that we expanded our media campaign in June with actress Kristin Chenoweth, who is encouraging women to request a Genius exam from their provider. While Breast Health was the growth leader in the third quarter, our other businesses also performed very well, highlighting the unique value that our portfolio of market-leading products provides. Our biggest business, Diagnostics, posted sales of $306.9 million in the quarter, a very healthy growth rate of 7.0% in constant currency terms. The story in cytology and blood screening was similar to previous quarters, while the molecular business outperformed. First, global sales of cytology and perinatal products totaled $118.1 million. Consistent with recent quarterly trends, sales were basically flat on a constant currency basis, as domestic market share gains and slight international growth offset continued pressure from longer screening intervals in the United States. Although, we are managing well against this headwind, we do not think it is behind us, as overall Pap volumes in the U.S. continue to decline. Second, worldwide blood screening sales were $64.2 million, up 18.5% on a constant currency basis, compared to a relatively weak prior year comparable that resulted from normal inventory fluctuations. Blood screening growth continued to benefit from the business our partner Grifols won with the Japanese Red Cross, which more than offset a continuing slow decline in U.S. blood donation levels. As you know, the growth benefits of the JRC contract will annualize in our fiscal fourth quarter. Now let\u2019s turn to Molecular Diagnostics, where quarterly sales of $124.6 million increased 8.9% on a constant currency basis. This growth rate accelerated for the third consecutive quarter and included stellar domestic growth of 12.6%. All of our key women\u2019s health assays for chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV and trichomonas grew solidly in the quarter, and all won important new competitive accounts. Much of this success was due to continued adoption of our fully automated Panther instrument. Placements of new Panthers were robust in the quarter and we have now shipped well over 1,000 units to clinical diagnostic and blood screening customers. In addition, utilization per instrument continues to grow. To round out the revenue discussion, let me mention that we remain pleased with the turnaround in Surgical sales. As you might recall, Surgical was a standout last quarter, but admittedly versus a softer prior year comparable. This quarter, our Surgical team achieved a second straight quarter of double-digit constant currency growth, but against a much more challenging comp, as we continue to see benefits from more effective pricing strategies and the new clinical specialists we have hired. Although, we do not yet view this business as a double-digit grower over the long-term, we were pleased that global sales of our NovaSure product were flat on a constant currency basis this quarter and MyoSure sales again increased by more than 30%. Finally, worldwide Skeletal sales were $22 million in the quarter, down 1.4% on a constant currency basis. Sales increased solidly in the United States based on continued strength of our new Horizon bone density scanner, but declined internationally due to fluctuations in distributor ordering patterns. We are not concerned about this single quarterly result, although Skeletal was our only business that didn\u2019t grow this quarter. On the positive side, we\u2019ll have something to shoot for as we close out our fiscal year. We have lots of aspirational goals over the long-term, as well. Hologic has been mainly a turnaround story for the last year or so, but we don\u2019t want to be perceived that way forever. Instead, our goal is to build a sustainable growth company. To do that, we are focused on adding new drivers to the tool box we already have, which contributed to our strong third quarter results. For example, we are focusing on creating an international growth engine for the long-term. We have the right leader in place and Claus Egstrand is building a high-performance team around him. We have identified several attractive growth opportunities, and are building the capabilities to capitalize on that, but we are in the very early innings of this effort. Second, we are boosting the level of innovation and productivity in our research and development activities. This is a multi-faceted effort that involves new leadership, better market insights, more efficient processes, and greater accountability. This will not be a quick effort either, but it can have a significant long-term pay-off. So while it\u2019s clear that we\u2019ve accomplished a lot so far, it\u2019s just as clear that we have a lot of work ahead of us. There are many chapters still to be written in the growth story of Hologic. And we view that as very good news for our shareholders, as our longer-term initiatives will make us an even stronger company. Now I will hand the call over to Bob. Bob McMahon : Thank you Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to walk through our third quarter income statement and performance, describe improvements we've made to our balance sheet, then discuss our financial guidance which we're increasing for the third time this year. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Steve said, momentum has been building steadily in all of our businesses. And this trend continued in the third quarter as our topline grew at double-digit rates both domestically and internationally on a constant currency basis. At the same time, we showed sold leverage on the gross operating and net profit lines. So despite a currency headwind, earnings per share increased by 16.2%, significantly faster than revenues and ahead of our most recent guidance. I should point out that net income grew at an even faster rate but the translation to EPS was diluted by higher share count resulting from the convertible notes on our balance sheet and our rising stock price. One of the highlights for the quarter was our strong gross margin of 65.2%, an improvement of 230 basis points compared to the prior year period. Several factors contributed to this result. First, we benefited from the 12.7% revenue growth in the U.S., where margins are generally higher. Second, in terms of product mix, stabilization of both our ThinPrep and NovaSure product lines, continued growth of our Aptima women's health assays and the acceleration of Genius 3D sales and service, all boosted gross margins. And third we benefited from both the efficiencies that come with higher volumes and very early returns from our productivity initiatives. Total operating expenses of $222.4 million, increased by 12.2% in the quarter. The biggest contributor to this increase was variable compensation as higher performance-based compensation resulted from the strong financial performance we\u2019ve seen this year. We also made additional investments in a few high return areas as we foreshadowed last quarter. For example, non-GAAP research and development expenses increased 8% and sales and marketing spending grew 13.9% as we boost to support for our genius 3-D mammography efforts based on early positive returns. Net-net, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 33.2% in the quarter, up a very healthy 170 basis points from last year. We remain one of the most profitable companies in our sector and are committed to remaining so even as we invest appropriately to generate sustainable growth. To round out the income statement, interest expense declined by 11.8% due to continued debt repayment. Our tax rate of 34.25% was in line with expectations and improved slightly compared to last year. And finally, our diluted share count for the quarter was 292.6 million shares, an increase of 4.8% that resulted mainly from our strong stock performance pushing convertible notes further into money. Before turning to our updated guidance, I want to highlight a few other metrics that demonstrate our commitment to operational excellence and our focus on improving financial efficiency. Total debt outstanding was $3.9 billion, a decrease of $0.3 billion compared to a year ago. We generated operating cash flow of $242.3 million in the quarter, a very healthy increase of 53% compared to the prior year. The significant increase was driven by higher net income combined with working capital improvements primarily from better inventory management. Based on this excellent cash flow generation, we ended the quarter with $888.8 million in cash and equivalents and the net debt position of $3.053 billion, an improvement of $579 million compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $249.7 million in the third quarter, up 12.6% and tracking to a $ 1 billion annual run rate. With the strong EBITDA growth and debt reduction, our leverage ratio -- net debt over EBITDA has improved further to 3.2 times. And we are well on our way to our target of 2.5 times by 2017. The combination of growing topline, improving productivity and lower debt have contributed to a significant improvement in ROIC, which was 10.6% in the quarter on a trailing 12 month basis, an increase of 230 basis points compared to the prior year period. Improving business prospects and strong cash flow also enabled us to continue the transformation of our balance sheet in the third quarter. We refinanced both our bank loans as well as our senior notes, providing us with greater flexibility and lower interest rate. In May, we established a new, five-year secured credit agreement that consisted of a $1.5 billion senior term loan and upsized $1 billion revolver. We pay interest on this new debt at LIBOR plus 1.75% saving more than $8 million in interest annually based on recent interest rates. We used the proceeds to pay off our previous term loans. So our total debt remains substantially unchanged. But importantly, we extended the maturity on the debt to 2020 and gained additional flexibility to retire our convertible notes when they become callable. Then in early July, we completed a private offering of $billion of senior notes at par with an interest rate of 5.25%. The proceeds will be used to pay off existing senior notes, reducing interest expense by $10 million annually and pushing out the maturity two years to 2022. All told, we significantly improve the quality of our balance sheet in the third quarter and gained flexibility to further enhance shareholder value in the future. We are making excellent progress and we still have more work to do to achieve our long-term capital deployment goals. Specifically, we recognized that a capital structure containing such high levels of convertible debt is unusual for a company our size and we\u2019re committed to normalizing this over time. Now I\u2019d like to provide an update on our financial guidance for the full fiscal year in the fourth quarter. Based on our strong third quarter performance, we are pleased to be raising guidance again. As always, this guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates. For the 2015 fiscal year and on a reported basis, we now expect total revenues of $2.687 billion to $2.697 billion. Compared to the prior year, this equates to reported revenue growth of between 7% and 7.4% and constant currency growth of between 9.1% and 9.5%. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for the full year of between $1.65 and a $1.66. This translates to reported EPS growth of between 13% and 13.7% or 17.1% to 17.8% on a constant currency basis. As noted in the release, these percentage changes for the prior year exclude the one-time benefit associated with amending the Roka license agreement, which added $20.1 million of revenue and $0.05 of EPS to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. As we alluded to last quarter, our increased EPS guidance incorporates some incremental investments to accelerate and extend our growth prospects, especially in breast health and diagnostics. It assumes a tax rate of 34.25% for the full year and a higher diluted share count of $291 million -- 291 million for year, as a higher stock price has pushed some of our convertible notes deeper in the money. Obviously this implies that our shared count for the fourth quarter will be higher, probably around 299 million shares. And looking at fiscal 2016, we expect our share count to be close to 305 million based on current market conditions. We note that this share count is higher than what we see in most sell-side models. With only one quarter left in our fiscal year, the math on our fourth quarter guidance is straightforward. We expect revenue of between $685 million and $695 million. Compared to the prior year, this guidance reflects reported revenue growth of 6.9% to 8.5% and constant currency growth of 9.3% to 10.9%. We anticipate that this revenue performance will drive diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.41 to $0.42 in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow 7.9% to 10.5% on a reported basis or roughly 13.2% to 15.8% in constant currency. Again these percentages exclude the one-time benefit associated with amending the Roka license agreement. If we recall whether the company was, when we gave our initial 2015 financial guidance last November, less than a year ago, we\u2019ve clearly come a long way. And in fact, our performance has turned around more significantly and more rapidly than even we thought possible. In the third quarter, specifically, our top line grew at 12.2% in constant currency terms and we showed that material operating leverage that drove EPS growth of 16.2%. While we don\u2019t expect these kinds of growth rates to continue forever, especially as the comps get tougher, our strategic planning process does give us confidence in our future trajectory. With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll now go to Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Tycho Peterson : Thanks. Great quarter, guys. Maybe just starting with breast health at 20% constant currency growth. Can you maybe just talk about what you are seeing in the field? Are you seeing faster conversion, presumably, than maybe you had anticipated and where do you think we are in the tomo upgrade cycle? Steve MacMillan : Yeah. We\u2019re clearly seeing an increase. I think what we\u2019re starting to see is the impact of our marketing efforts and frankly a lot of patient demand actually starting to drive hospitals to really accelerate further. And I think it\u2019s clearly a big uptick and faster than what we would've anticipated but we\u2019re hearing a lot of pressure, certainly from the hospital systems and I think, based on incoming orders continuing to feel good. We then remind you that we\u2019re still in the early to early mid-innings of the potential left just to the United States. So we\u2019re still well less than half of the way at all -- even nearly through our installed base. There is still a lot of runway ahead of us. Tycho Peterson : And then onto molecular, 9% constant currency growth is great. We saw Roche put up good numbers for their HPV business as well. Can you maybe talk about the market dynamics that you're seeing in molecular? And obviously, you don't have the primary screen yet. So maybe just talk about competitive dynamics as well? Steve MacMillan : Yeah. I think we continue to feel really good certainly about our position at HPV and our Panther system. So again as you will know, there have been so much attention paid to the Quest Contract, say, a year ago. But what we\u2019ve really been focused on over the last year or even during that time is additional Panther replacements. And as those Panthers come online, we have more machines in the field and then as people get experienced with them, they start to put more of our assays on them and just builds over time. So we\u2019re feeling very good. There is probably some positive market, overall market dynamics here. So that we don\u2019t want to take all the credit for it but clearly I think if we look throughout the molecular diagnostics industry right now, volumes probably looking pretty good. Bob McMahon : Yeah. And Tycho, I would add. This is Bob. Specific to HPV while we don\u2019t disclose that, we feel really good about our performance in HPV. Believe it, it was that faster than the market and we believe we\u2019re number one in that market place in the U.S. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Alex Nowak : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. This is actually Alex filling in for Bill. So first one for me, any update on the timing for NAT testing in China? Steve MacMillan : It's rolling out sporadically across the country. Alex Nowak : Okay. Great. And then, where are we with the virology launch in Europe and when should we expect these assays to make it Stateside? And then, somewhat related, what\u2019s the potential impact on the business following CMS\u2019s five-year recommended interval for combined HPV and Pap screens? Thanks. Mike Watts : Hey, Alex, it\u2019s Mike. Let me take the question on virology timeline. As you know, we introduced not too long ago, our HIV product with the CE Mark in Europe. We will probably look to the next calendar year to flesh out the menu with additional HCV and HPV assays, and then probably in the \u201817 calendar year to bring the first product to the U.S., which would be HIV as well. Steve MacMillan : And on the question of the five year screening and I think we continue to see as we referenced in the script, an extension of the interval as it relates to Pap. I think in the long run, we frankly think the science is clocked to go to five years and I think that will continue to play out. People will understand that it maybe a little too far but in the meantime, we are dealing with that. Operator : We'll go next to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. So, Steve, I'm just curious on -- given sort of that massive, massive showing within breast health, any comments around where we are -- you know, what the penetration levels are within 3D tomo? And I'm more curious on the potential for share gains here, right? Clearly, it looks like your customer base, they are believing in the new technology, right? So does this sort of provide a longer tail for you to sort of gain share against competition? Thank you Steve MacMillan : Yeah. Thanks, Vijay. Good to hear from you. The way we look at it, in terms of our installed base, we are not giving the exact numbers. But we feel very good on both our conversions, but also the fact that we are well under, well under only halfway there. So, we're not even close to halfway through our base. This should continue to run really for several years in terms of the momentum and so the competitive piece, we are definitely winning competitive customers. And I think we are certainly, I think it is fair to say we are winning more competitive ones than we are losing. And I think people really are seeing the combination of our proven technology. We have the best clinical data out there with the study published in JAMA. We have the best label. We have the fastest scan time. This really is -- frankly, we are more differentiated in the 3D world than we probably ever were in the 2D world. And I think our sales teams are doing a tremendous job of educating customers that way, combined with some patient demand and our marketing efforts, all of which clearly led to an inflection in the quarter, the one that we feel good about sustaining here for ways. Vijay Kumar : Great. And maybe one quick one for Bob. Great margin pull-through. I'm just curious, sort of how much of this was driven by volume uplift, given the top-line performance, versus some of the structural things that you've been talking about, Bob? Can we expect sort of margin upside here as people look over the next few years? Bob McMahon : Yeah. I think we\u2019ve talked about the productivity initiatives that are starting to be put in place. I would say that those are still in the early stages. And as we think about this, certainly the U.S., we benefited from the U.S. growth being much faster than we had anticipated, which really helps from a geography and a gross margin perspective. Our guidance going forward, we anticipate a slight decline sequentially in our gross margin but still up versus prior year. And the way we are thinking about it is, as we are looking to grow our international business longer-term, that\u2019s going to put downward pressure on our margins. We generally see slightly lower margins outside the U.S. and inside the U.S. And I think what\u2019s happening is actually some of the higher volume in the U.S., coupled with some of these initiatives, we are actually seeing some of that benefit before the international growth kind of kicks in. So, we feel good about where we are and the progress we are making. Not ready to say that we are going to continue to see margin improvement enhancements to the level that we have this quarter. Operator : We will go next to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good afternoon. Steve MacMillan : Hey Dave. David Lewis : Steve, you talked about sustainability of the tendon and the strap plan that you just concluded and obviously given this tremendous quarter. You talked about these two major drivers sustainability if I\u2019m catching it right. One was international. The other was you said, innovation, Am I kind of calling at the pipeline. So, just taking the second one here for a second, when do you expect to start seeing material productivity coming out of the pipeline? And when you start thinking that innovation for this business, how heavily do you think you are going to have to rely on M&A? Steve MacMillan : Sure. Great question, David. I think on the pipeline, truthfully, we are still a few years away. I think as you probably wrote shortly after I started. There is investments in cultural shifts that have to happen and I think the way we are thinking of that are high level is those -- the impact of what we are doing today is probably more in \u201918 and beyond event. We\u2019ve been perfectly candid. I think we kind of said that the pipeline was not rich. In the meantime, I think there is so much more opportunity in the shorter term with the products we have to help us bridge through what is probably a longer gap than we would prefer. So, I think we feel pretty good. And I think clearly on the M&A front, we\u2019ve refocused our organic growth. We will certainly start to recrank up what I call small-scale bite size kinds of things. But even nothing in the very short-term on that, as we continue to paydown the debt. Having said that, I think is where -- with the performance we are generating, we are running at a very good pace relative to our debt to EBITDA goals by the end of 2017. We are clearly running ahead of that, which will probably give us a little chance to maybe do some more tuck-ins to help us even bridge a gap if there was one before the pipeline really kicks in. But we are still not returning to the old days of big acquisitions and any of that stuff. David Lewis : That\u2019s very helpful, Steven. And Bob, just a quick question on -- you\u2019ve given the topline performance that I think most would have expected, greater drop throughs. So, obviously, you are balancing significant topline performance and reinvestments in the business, which is the right thing to be doing. So as you think about SG&A, it seems like that was the real reinvestment this quarter. Can you just give us a flavor about where some of those investments in SG&A are going and should we expect those investments to continue here, obviously heading into \u201916? Thank you. Bob McMahon : Yeah. Thanks, Dave. Good question. One of the areas that we really focus and is really helping, I think drive the topline is really the investments around our sales and marketing. So that\u2019s probably one of the areas that we will continue to look to generate incremental investment that is driving the topline. We\u2019ve seen a nice ROI. Principally behind our breast health business is the ramping up of the 3D adoption, continues to go. Even with that incremental investment, we still had a nice operating income leverage of approximately 170 basis points versus prior year. We are probably one of the leading profitability companies in our sector. We will continue to grow and invest appropriately to drive that topline. That\u2019s probably the biggest area as we also talked about there was variable compensation that was really a result of the topline as well, that kind of goes with the investment but the incremental investment was really our sales and marketing investment. Operator : For next question, we will go to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. I wanted to focus on tomo for a minute, putting some of your earlier comments into context here. If we think about what the adoption curve should look like for tomo this time versus what 2D looked like, I noted that you said that you felt like you had a stronger competition this time around than last. So should we assume that to mean that you guys are aiming to perhaps increase your overall market share in this business, even though you have some pretty sizable competitors? Steve MacMillan : I think we always go against formidable competitors. I think we think our product is even more differentiated, which our goal, clearly is to take what is already a strong leadership position but go even higher. So, our goal is not just to replace what we have. We think we ought to be able to win and so hopefully that does give us a little bit more runway. Bob McMahon : Maybe I will just add on that. I think one of the things that we talked about is this cultural shift. I will tell you, the organization, breast health, diagnostics or the surgical business -- they are not satisfied, which is replacing our installed base. Our goal is to grow faster than the market and gain share. Isaac Ro : Great. That's helpful. And then just maybe another question on diagnostics. Obviously, you are doing a pretty good job holding the line in the core Pap business. Wondering when we might get a better sense of your expectations and plans to sort of drive some innovation on the molecular side, given all the assets you have. You clearly have a lot of things to work with. But just curious about when we might know more about pipeline and kind of the longer-term plan to accelerate growth? Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Sure. I think at this point, what we are really seeing on the molecular side, we\u2019ve got the virology program coming first as Mike referenced earlier, certainly outside the U.S. and then inside the U.S. We\u2019ve disclosed that we are working on an upgrade to Panther as well, which will allow the PCR capability and that will then allow us to do more assays in the PCA world. Those are still a few years away. We are in the earlier stages there. But you can imagine, we are going to be doing a lot of the standard menu expansion and those kinds of things that other folks are working on and building off of the strong base we have and really this is a business that every additional Panther we place today will be beneficial down the road. Operator : Next, we will go to Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian Weinstein : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just first start talking about kind of pricing throughout the organization? Maybe talk about -- is tomo pricing holding where it has been? Is there any kind of price reduction from competitors coming online? Also, what's going on as far as pricing on the molecular side? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Yeah. Brian, I will take this. Blood pressure is kind of a way of life and healthcare. And certainly, we see that in our markets. But what I would tell you is the good news is our products, we are selling on the benefits of our products. And I would tell you that the pricing that we\u2019ve seen over the last year has been relatively flat across all of our major product lines. And I think some of that is incentivizing our reps for margin improvement, forming them with the benefits of our products and then also more pricing discipline that we have. I think if you look at it, just looking at our gross margins certainly, they have gone up despite the price pressure. Some of that is a result of the mix and so forth. But I feel good about kind of where our pricing is and our ability to continue to grow despite some of the pricing pressures. Brian Weinstein : Got it. Got it. And then for the fourth-quarter guidance, it implies basically down sequentially from the Q3 levels, except for the very, very high end of the range. Is there anything in particular in the fourth quarter? Was there anything that was pulled forward into the third quarter that is causing that fourth quarter to be down sequentially in your guide? Thank you. Steve MacMillan : There was nothing pulled forward. Let\u2019s be really clear about that. The couple of things, we mentioned there was a $5 million extra, basically from the divestiture, which was us providing basically a trailing agreement there. There is a also a little bit of seasonality and I think what we\u2019ve really done over the last year is starting to normalize this business more so and we are going into the summer months. So, things like surgical procedures for our surgical business were little bit more down in that July, August timeframe I think as we see around the world. So it\u2019s really right along those fronts. Bill Bonello : Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Mike. I would just add on the bottomline, obviously as the share price continues to do well, the share count increases and that weighs a little bit on EPS as well. Operator : We will take our next question from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan : Hi. Thanks. And congrats on the quarter. I just want to start and ask about the better results in molecular. How much of an improvement in the quarter was related to Panther replacements versus instrument pull-through? And then just how would -- as you look through the end of the year, how do replacements look as you look out? Steve MacMillan : We continue to place Panther. The growth is really, it\u2019s multivariate. It\u2019s both more machines out there than it\u2019s ones that we placed previously started to be used a little bit more Jack and we continue to feel good about the pace of placements. Bob McMahon : Yes. I would say we -- to build on what Steve just said, we feel very good about the placements, so actually had the strongest placements in the third quarter of Panther\u2019s. And then it\u2019s really kind of a three-pronged approach. So it\u2019s placing more boxes, the revenue per box continues to grow which said that there is more assays going through those boxes. And that\u2019s also our sales organization has done a great job of also working with the physicians and clinics to drive utilization versus guidelines. So it\u2019s really kind of that three-pronged approach really living on the benefits of strong workflow and automation at the Panther brands. Jack Meehan : Got it. And just want to follow up on the last question as well. Just as you bridge into the fourth quarter guidance, can you maybe just tell us in the past quarter how the pacing of the growth went through the quarter, especially in Breast Health just how you expect the momentum to continue into the next quarter? Thanks. Bob McMahon : Jack, we are not going to get into that level of specificity. What we will say overall we feel good about the overall momentum. Operator : Take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Steve MacMillan : Hey, Doug. Doug Schenkel : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So subsequent to the completion of the recent strategic review, I was wondering if you would have mind providing us with an update on really where Claus and the rest of the OUS team is in the context of building out the OUS infrastructure. And I guess related to that, does some of the recent strength give you an opportunity to specifically maybe accelerate some of the timing of investment related to the OUS build-out? Steve MacMillan : It\u2019s a great question I tell you. I think we are legitimately in the first inning of the international build up because if you really and Bob and I spent fair amount of time over there recently. We are halfway between the startup and real company. When you look franchise by franchise outside the US that some of these businesses were just barely getting going and it is -- it would be a perfect time to invest even more. We would tell you right now we are pacing it based on where we stand. It\u2019s things like I would love to add more sales people around the world and our surgical business tomorrow. The reality is we don\u2019t necessary have reimbursement in place in all the key markets. So it\u2019s going to be a longer build and if I could, I think we would dump a lot of money there right now. But we would be throwing money that\u2019s not as efficient. And with the Bob at might side, he was incredibly good at making sure we are every investment we make we think about ROIC. It\u2019s going to be more paced, which will give us more longevity as we really go forward. Doug Schenkel : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just another follow-up on Panther. For the last few quarters you\u2019ve talked about a robust pick up in the pace of placements in response to a question before you indicated that utilization per box is trending up. Assuming that very few of these are replacements and assuming that the vast majority are regional rentals. Is it right to conclude that you probably feel a little bit better about sustainably growing MDX at least in the mid-single digit range given the predictability associated with these placements? Steve MacMillan : Yes. That\u2019s there. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Jon Groberg with UBS. Jon Groberg : Just to be clear, even you don\u2019t feel like providing your exact clinic placement number. Steve MacMillan : Hey, Jon, we are barely hearing you. Bob McMahon : Jon, can you try that again? Jon Groberg : Yes. Can you hear me okay now? Steve MacMillan : Yes. Perfect. Sorry. Jon Groberg : Sorry. I was just -- one was the clarification, you have been providing kind of updates on gene displacements, I mean I missed that it sounded like maybe you weren\u2019t going to be providing those anymore, just wanted to be clear? Mike Watts : Jon, it\u2019s Mike. We want to give you the color that you guys need, obviously to build your models and such. I mean, honestly, we talked a little bit about it internally and we don\u2019t really want to get in the habit of providing that number on a quarterly basis. I think that lots of factors, some of them beyond our control can affect placements or sales in an individual quarter. And frankly, we want to discourage a little bit of that over infatuation with the quarterly numbers. We had a record quarter this quarter of placements, very, very strong demand, but if you could bear with us, we will probably not to give that out every quarter. Jon Groberg : Okay. In the context of your international comment, is it most to say most of that was U.S. the growth in Genius? Mike Watts : Yes. Steve MacMillan : Yes. Though we did have some reasonable growth internationally in our Breast Health business as well, combination of a 2D and 3D, but clearly the strength was the US. Operator : We will go next to Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Richard Newitter : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. Steve MacMillan : Thanks, Rich. Richard Newitter : So just two quick ones both on tomo. First in the US, I was wondering I know that for period of time you guys have had placed 2D systems that were kind of 3D enabled, but just hadn\u2019t necessarily been lid up. And I was wondering if you can provide any color on whether or not there are many kind of 2D, 3D enabled systems in your US installed base last. Have those kind of all lid up subsequent to the January 1 reimbursement? Steve MacMillan : Yes. So we still have a portion of our 2D systems that are upgradable that are in our installed base, although it\u2019s approximately 15% to 20% of the installed base. So the vast majority of that will require a full gantry system upgrade to 3D. Richard Newitter : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe outside the US as one of the initiatives I think for kind of investment and where there is opportunity. I would imagine it\u2019s kind of improving the market share and performance on the 2D, 3D side. Can you talk a little bit about what steps you are taking there, what initiatives we can expect going forward to kind of improve performance there and it\u2019s really capitalizing that opportunity? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Sure, Rich. It\u2019s really reengaging and assessing our dealer network outside the US, mostly we got through dealers outside the US and I think what Claus and his team had been doing is building stronger relationships with those dealers to really get them driving the opportunity bigger. I would tell you I think as we look back at our history, we\u2019ve probably been more transactional just trying to get orders when we can. And we are building more much of a partnership that includes better pricing, discipline on our part which part of it\u2019s helping the margin structure overall and things like that. So I think it\u2019s reengaging that, it\u2019s getting into the tenders, it\u2019s a longer-term process, and making sure that we\u2019ve got the best dealer market by market to really build the business around the world. So it\u2019s a refocus, it\u2019s also recognizing. In some cases, we should be focusing on 2D, in some of the markets depending on where those markets are and not necessarily just trying to jam 3D everywhere. So it\u2019s really market by market and the heavy lifting of executional excellence, that\u2019s going to drive that business over time. And again we are early stages what we can really be there. Mike Watts : Yes. I think just to build on that. I think one of the other areas focusing on those dealer markets in also looking at what countries we can win and drive success in. And so it\u2019s really a focus on 10 to 12 countries in a much deeper and significant way as opposed to spreading our resources has been. Richard Newitter : Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Anthony Petrone : Good evening. And congratulations on the quarter. Maybe in what the Breast Health and then a couple for Bob on the financials. Maybe just a contribution from service in the quarter. I know that there has been increasing pretty significantly as well and you have a number of 3D systems that are likely off warranty at this point. So maybe the contribution from service as opposed to sales and upgrades. And then maybe Steve anything on the task force guidelines, I know the commentary you closed in mid May. I am just wondering if there is any update there on how you think that plays out and I will follow up with some questions for Bob. Bob McMahon : Okay. Let me just quickly answer the service question and then I will turn over to Steve on the guidelines. The service was a strong growth driver for us as well, actually group up 7%, total company for the quarter actually close to 9.6% on an constant currency basis. So that\u2019s a lot of that is on the back of installed, the acceleration of the installed placements on 3D and the higher service revenue associated with those installations. Steve MacMillan : Yes. And no update really on the preventive services task force guidelines. Anthony Petrone : All right, helpful there. And then just on the Bob on the balance sheet and tax leverage, I think my math is coming up with the debt ratio of little over 4, maybe just kind of update on what the target is and timing on that? And then also just an update on tax and the strategies going forward and what do you think for tax leverage over time? Thanks again. Bob McMahon : Yes. So just quickly the distinction between 4 and now probably 3.2 is net debt versus gross debt and we have been talking about a net debt target of 2.5 by 2017. In terms of the tax, we are still working through some of the foundational elements of that and actually some of the refinancings were much for providing us with obviously pushing up uncertainties and providing us with interest savings. And so it\u2019s as much also helping us with the tax and providing us some operational flexibility, better covenant profile that allows us to move IT around as we are looking at our manufacturing. The way that you should think about tax is really we\u2019re still building that foundation in '16 and start to see some of those savings in leverage on the tax line in fiscal '17 timeframe. Operator : We will take our next question from Bill Bonello with Craig-Hallum. Bill Bonello : Hey, good afternoon. And just a question on the outlook for continued clinical data and other sort of external catalyst that would push tomo like option. Obviously you had kind of a banner here with big studies capital with the reimbursement decision as we look forward beyond your own sales efforts. What external types of things may we anticipate that would continue to drive conversion in the market? Steve MacMillan : Bill, I don\u2019t know if we see any real major external events coming. I do think we feel very good about our ability to continue to drive the business. And as you maybe go on partially we might be going. As you think about '16 for us, fuller, we are not ready to give guidance or anything else, but I think for the total company as you think about some mid single-digit growth on top of the exceptional performance this year in revenue and obviously, we\u2019re going to be looking to have that leveraged on to the bottomline across the total company. But, I guess, no real external events probably expected on the Breast Health piece. Bill Bonello : Okay. And then just one truly related follow-up on that, in terms of the conversion that you are seeing, at one time there was some discussion as to the extent that individual centers were converting their systems whether they were going completely to 3D or whether they were adding a couple 3D instruments and keeping the bulk of 2D? What are you kind of seeing on that front right now, are you seeing a complete the conversion across customers, is this everywhere across the Board and any color on that? Steve MacMillan : We are seeing, probably, a faster adoption rate of institutions that has one or two systems and it\u2019s really being driven by two things, one is the radiologist experience. Now we continue to hear and every time I\u2019ve been on the field, we continue to hear from the radiologist, they don't feel good anymore giving 2D exams to people, once they\u2019ve seen the 3D results. They know they are detecting more cancers with 3D and they know they are preventing more false positives and therefore basically reducing biopsies. So, I think, there's a passionate belief among the radiology community that as they\u2019ve got an experience with 3D, it\u2019s the best patient care they should be offering. And so what you have is in these institutions where they had several, they're probably going back and seeking funding for a more full-scale conversion, faster than we might have imagine. It\u2019s also been partially driven I think by greater patient awareness, some of are on marketing and PR campaigns. As well as, frankly, just a lot of a popular media that's out there, even some of that the mainstream media reacting negatively to the USPSTF guidelines. So you\u2019ve got all these things eating together that are encouraging probably a faster adoption. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill. Derik de Bruin : Hi. Good afternoon. Steve MacMillan : Hey, Derik. Derik de Bruin : So, lot of my questions has been answered but just a couple to follow-up here. So, $56 million, 8% growth in R&D this quarter, is that a reasonable run rate to think about it over the next few quarters? Bob McMahon : Yeah. I mean, I think, the way we kind of think about it is that, we look at -- when we look at R&D at around 8% of our revenue, we think that that\u2019s about right. On a quarterly basis you\u2019ll see some puts and takes depending on what that -- the investments for the development programs, but that\u2019s a reasonable approximate, yes. Derik de Bruin : Great. And then just one quick Panther question, you have said record placements in the quarter. Could you just give us some idea, how many new customers, are there any swaps -- people swapping out Tigris for Panthers, competitive wins, just a little bit more dynamic on that market? Mike Watts : Hey, Derik. It\u2019s Mike. So just to clarify that comment, the reference to record Panther placements, certainly it was a record for this year. Derik de Bruin : Yeah. Mike Watts : But it would not has been a record of all time, so don\u2019t want anyone to think that. Very healthy placements this quarter, best of the year but not the best all time. And we\u2019re seeing, I think we had a particularly good quarter of competitive wins. Certainly, still some customers upgrading, but a good percentage of the placement this quarter were in fact competitive takeaway, so we\u2019re please with that. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Mark Massaro : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. As we look out at the Breast Health business, it looks to me like there's at least two more quarters of relatively easy comps. Steve, can you just talk about the positive sources of upside as you look out with respect to comps. And maybe can you comment on seasonality in this summer quarter coming up? Steve MacMillan : Sure. Obviously, as we start to go into next fiscal year, the comps start to really change. And hence, we\u2019re not going to be growing our breast health business 20% on top of 20% growth. So, I think the comps get harder and yet we feel good about the underlying trajectory really for all of our businesses. So, I think we are feeling pretty good. But obviously, as we start to think about guidance for next year and everything else going to be more tempered relative to the kind of numbers we\u2019re putting up right now. Mark Massaro : Okay. Great. And then with respect to the organizational structure, I know you've done a great job bringing in new leadership. Are you done there, are there additional adds you\u2019re contemplating. And then can you also comment on expanding internationally as well? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Yeah. I think, I\u2019d say we are in the later innings of any major personnel change. We\u2019ve got most of the key leaders in place, still a few opportunities here and there. But for the most part, we\u2019ve really just about made all of the key changes. As you point out the exception -- internationally, we\u2019re still building the team. Bob and I were over in Europe couple weeks ago and Claus had three new leaders literally just started in June. So, I think they are probably a year behind. Internationally what we've done in the U.S. in terms of building up the team, so there are earlier innings there. Operator : We will take our next question from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : Good afternoon. Steve MacMillan : Hey, Jayson. Jayson Bedford : Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations. You guys have done a nice job with the business. Tough to poke holes here, but I wanted to ask about the non-U.S. molecular business, which seemed a little bit weaker. And I just wanted to give you -- if you can give us some expanded thoughts on your molecular business outside the U.S. Steve MacMillan : I don\u2019t have to expand it too much. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s weak. It\u2019s a big opportunity for us and one of the leaders I just referenced and we just brought onboard a couple weeks ago is our new leader of international diagnostics sales. So it is a clear source of upside and now one of our prouder moments -- for prouder businesses at the moment. Jayson Bedford : Okay. That's fair. And maybe just for Bob. You mentioned the early returns on the gross margin line from the productivity initiatives. To the extent you can, can you just give us a little bit more detail on what the initiatives are? How long will they take to fully implement? And maybe, again, if you can, the ultimate impact of these initiatives on the gross margin line? Bob McMahon : Yes. So, Jayson, I\u2019m not going to give you, kind of what the ultimate game plan and what our targets are. But what I would say is these are both near-term and then we have medium-term and longer term. And some of the near-term are just the cost improvement opportunities of driving more efficiencies through the plans. We\u2019ve talked a little bit about in previous calls around sourcing. We\u2019ve seen some early initiatives there that are driving some cost improvements. I still think that these opportunities continue to drive, sourcing savings as we look to centralize that organization and drive. And then longer-term, as we look to streamline our processes within the factories and get more of a lean kind of mentality. I think that there's a big opportunity there. So we\u2019ve got short-term, medium-term and longer-term opportunities. Steve MacMillan : Operator, I think we\u2019ve got time for probably two more questions. Operator : All right. We\u2019ll go next to Jon Block with Stifel. Jon Block : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. First one, Steve, for you, back in the day was the move from film to digital in mammo. There were some metrics where facilities with film were literally seeing lost volumes at their practice. And I'm just curious; you mentioned your marketing spend. Are your reps currently armed with any similar or hard data on the move from 2D to 3D, which is arguably helping accelerate 3D demand or is it mostly media-driven phenomenon at this point and some of that data might still be on the come? Steve MacMillan : There is great clinical data, there is our label and there is consumer demand, so I\u2019d say, its multi-variant. Jon Block : Okay. And then the other one just a little bit more big picture. I think one of the concerns when you took over was, did op margins peak out here at 30%, 31%? Clearly that was the wrong thought. You are 33%. You are plowing significant investments in the business. Can you just talk to us structurally anything that would prevent those op margins from moving to 35% over time? And I guess, Bob, maybe if you want to weigh in here, is it something where the international growth in the margins that company that won't allow you to get there or anything where you just see so many opportunities in front of you where you just won't allow that level of profitability to drop through in the near-term? Thanks, guys. Bob McMahon : Yeah. I think that that\u2019s the way you\u2019re thinking about that in the later part of the question is kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it. So as the international business grows, certainly that\u2019s at a lower margin, which is going to put some pressure on it. We talked about kind of balancing those lower prices. But then also I think as we are we are digging under the covers, so to speak, we\u2019ve still got a relatively new management team across. We do see a lot of opportunities, not only for streamlining but also growth opportunities that we want to appropriately invest in. So that\u2019s one thing I think as we think about not only investing in a relative to ROIC but also to top and bottom lines. We\u2019re not going to be afraid of reinvesting into the business to have that sustainable growth that Steve talked about before. Steve MacMillan : And I wouldn\u2019t see as getting the 35 but the 33 range that we\u2019re at is probably a healthy level. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham and Company. Brad Mas : Hi. It's actually Brad in for Mike. Just two quick ones for me to finish up. Just wondering with the strength in surgical, can you give an update on the sales force? Have you guys been adding reps? Is that kind of what's driving it? And if so, how many? Steve MacMillan : Sure. What we really done there is we\u2019ve added some clinical specialists to help support some of the caseload, particularly with our MyoSure procedure. So what it's done its allowed the sales reps to really focus on hunting and building out the customer base. While we have the clinical specialist serving a lot of the case coverage and that really has helped. Brad Mas : Perfect. And then just wondering how you guys are thinking about the growth profile of blood screening in Q4 and then going forward, just as you guys lap the Red Cross agreement in Japan? Steve MacMillan : Yeah. Great question Brad. I think we\u2019ve had four good quarters of growth clearly from the JRC and that\u2019s now behind us. This was the fourth quarter. So I think we see this pretty flat now. Probably return into a basic market, I think the global blood screening business is probably a flattish to even slightly down. And unfortunately for us, we\u2019ll probably be much closer to those numbers now going forward. I think that is all the time we have. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have questions today. This now concludes Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. Have a good evening.",

Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to the Hologic, Inc., Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Shannon. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and CEO, and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today; then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our fourth quarter press release is available on the Investors section of our website, along with the supplemental financial presentation for today's call. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived on our website through November 27. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known as well as unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement including in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release or the supplemental presentation. I'd also like to remind everyone that last year's fourth quarter results included a one-time benefit associated with the restructuring of our license agreement with Roka Bioscience. This agreement added $20.1 million to Diagnostics revenue in the prior year quarter, boosted gross and operating margins and increased EPS by approximately $0.05. So in our call today, all year-over-year comparisons and percentage changes will exclude this one-time event from the base year unless otherwise noted. This is consistent with how we presented and forecasted our financial results over the last year. Please reference our press release or the supplemental presentation for comparisons that includes the one-time benefit from Roka. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Once again, our performance was strong as we executed well across all aspects of our business. Revenue grew at a double-digit rate on a constant currency basis, while earnings per share grew even faster. And these results capped off an outstanding year, in which our people and our products, enabled us to exceed expectations across the board. In 2015, Hologic achieved financial results that seemed impossible a year ago. And while we have a tremendous amount of work ahead of us to build a sustainable growth company, we begin fiscal 2016 with a healthy sense of optimism. With that introduction, let me dive into our fourth quarter revenue results. Then Bob will take you through the rest of the income statement, the balance sheet, and our initial 2016 guidance. As a reminder, the percentage changes we provide will generally exclude the one-time Roka benefit from last year, as Mike just mentioned. Total revenues were $702.8 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 9.7% on a reported basis and 12.2% in constant currency terms. Very coincidentally, these were exactly the same percentage increases that we posted in our third quarter despite the more difficult comparable. We were very pleased with the breadth of our revenue performance in the fourth quarter. Many of you have seen our simple red-green dashboard, which tracks the sales growth of our four major businesses. We're happy to report that for the first time, all fifteen boxes on that chart were green for the fourth quarter. In other words, every business and, obviously, the company as a whole grew in the United States and internationally. What's more, three of our businesses grew at double-digit, constant currency rates in the quarter, making them dark green on our chart. Geographically, our U.S. businesses performed well again in the fourth quarter, with 12.2% revenue growth. This performance is a testament to the value that our products bring to patients, and the relationships that our sales teams enjoy with our customers. Over time, we want our international teams to build the same kind of success. And while we have a long road ahead of us, we were encouraged by some early progress in the fourth quarter. International sales grew 12.5% in constant currency terms, and importantly, we achieved this growth without much contribution from our blood screening business with the Japan Red Cross. As you know, that growth benefit annualized in the fourth quarter. A few areas picked up the slack. For example, international sales of our cytology and perinatal business increased 10.3% in the quarter on a constant currency basis, and we believe we are just scratching the surface of this long-term opportunity. In addition, after several consecutive quarters of declines, our molecular diagnostics business turned the corner and posted modest growth. And finally, our breast imaging products grew in excess of 20% internationally, although our penetration rates and market shares remain low. Now let's provide some more detail on our divisional revenue performance. In a continuation of recent trends, Breast Health was again the growth leader in the quarter driven by strong adoption of our Genius 3D mammography exams. Globally, Breast Health sales were $286.3 million, up 21.6% in constant currency terms. Underlying this, sales of breast imaging products and service grew 26.2%. Since it's the end of our fiscal year, we wanted to provide you a little more detail on Genius uptake to help you calibrate your models. In the United States, we shipped approximately 300 Genius systems to customers in the fourth quarter. This was our best quarter of shipments to date. On a cumulative basis, we have now shipped approximately 2,400 3D systems in the United States. While we are making excellent progress, this represents less than 30% of our own domestic mammography installed base, so we have a long runway still ahead of us before the market fully converts to 3D. We have also installed roughly 1,200 Genius systems in international markets, so our global installed base is now approximately 3,600. In addition to these strong placement metrics, two other factors have us encouraged about our future prospects in the mammography market. First, we estimate we have gained more than 300 basis points of domestic market share over the course of fiscal 2015. As a result, we believe that our share of the overall mammography market was roughly 60% as of year-end. More importantly, we think we can gain more share, based on our first-mover advantage, our superior product profile, and the excellent work of our commercial teams. Reflecting their efforts, a recent study published by the market research firm KLAS showed that mammography customers scored Hologic highest in all 11 performance measures they evaluated. Second, despite the large number of shipments we have made in the last two quarters, the orders we have in house have never been higher. This is not a perfect indicator of future demand, so we don't intend to provide much more detail here, but it certainly indicates customers are recognizing the significant value that our Genius technology provides patients. We are bullish on our prospects in Breast Health despite what has become a cacophony in the media around the role of breast cancer screening. As I'm sure you've seen, the American Cancer Society recently updated their guidelines in this area. The ACS recommendations are different than what the United States Preventive Services Task Force proposed a few months ago and different than guidelines issued by other venerable organizations such as the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Radiology, and others. As a result, many of these groups, as well as numerous patient and advocacy organizations, have objected loudly to the ACS and USPSTF guidelines in recent weeks. Despite all the noise, we do not expect these guideline changes to have a material effect on our business. We see some good in the ACS guidelines, and the number of mammograms has remained relatively stable in recent years despite similar policy debates. And most importantly, we still have lots of headroom to convert older technologies to our Genius 3D systems. We do, however, have strong opinions on this debate and are advocating for our position with policy makers, doctors, and customers. We believe four points are critically important. First, mammograms save lives, even in an era of better breast cancer treatments. Countless studies have shown this, and both the ACS and the USPSTF acknowledge it as fact. Second, women should be informed about their options and have the right to make a personal decision in consultation with their doctors. The ACS clearly supports this and we're doing our part to promote education through direct-to-consumer marketing, which is having a positive effect. Third, no woman should be denied a mammogram due to her age or her ability to pay. According to the ACS, roughly 25% of breast cancer deaths occur in women who were first diagnosed before the age of 50. So why do some organizations recommend starting screening at 50? In addition, the ACS says that lack of insurance coverage should not be a barrier to screening. That's why Hologic is supporting the bipartisan PALS act in Congress, which would impose a two-year moratorium on implementing the USPSTF recommendations. Fourth, our Genius 3D mammograms were specifically designed to address the limitations of older screening technologies, studies of which have been the basis of the recent guideline changes. If you want greater detection of invasive cancers, Genius mammograms have been proven to identify 41% more dangerous tumors; and if you're concerned about patient anxiety from false positives, Genius mammograms reduce call-backs by as much as 40%. It's clear that all mammograms are not created equal. Our recent commercial success demonstrates that our customers understand this, and we are working hard to ensure that this message is understood even more broadly. Now I'd like to shift gears and focus on Hologic's other businesses, which also performed well in the fourth quarter. Our biggest business, Diagnostics, posted sales of $304.2 million in the quarter, a solid growth rate of 4.4% in constant currency terms. As expected, Diagnostics growth slowed compared to recent periods, as we annualized the growth benefits of the blood screening contract our partner Grifols won with the Japanese Red Cross. As a result, worldwide blood screening sales were $60.2 million in the quarter, up 2.3% in constant currency. Elsewhere in Diagnostics, we are pleased with the performance of our ThinPrep franchise, as global sales of cytology and perinatal products totaled $120.8 million in the fourth quarter. U.S. sales were basically flat, as market share gains continued to offset headwinds from longer screening intervals. But we are encouraged that international revenue grew at a double-digit rate. Based on this, global product sales grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis, our best quarterly performance in a number of years. Now let's turn to molecular diagnostics, where quarterly sales of $123.2 million increased 6.6% in constant currency. Domestic revenues increased a very solid 7.2% based on strong placements of our fully automated Panther instrument, a healthy number of competitive wins, and increasing utilization of our women's health assays. In addition, our international business grew nominally for the first time in many quarters, as highlighted earlier. We recognize that one quarter does not yet make a trend, but hopefully this represents a start to a multi-year growth cycle. To round out the revenue discussion, we remain pleased with the trajectory of Surgical sales, which totaled $86.8 million in the fourth quarter. This represented our third straight quarter of double-digit, constant currency growth and our best overall performance in the last several years. Our MyoSure product for hysteroscopic tissue removal again showed terrific growth, while sales of NovaSure increased slightly on a constant currency basis. Finally, worldwide Skeletal sales were $25.5 million in the quarter, an increase of 13.7% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued growth of our new Horizon bone density scanner. You might recall that last quarter, Skeletal was our only business that did not grow, so we're especially proud of the team for their double-digit performance, which became the final piece of our growth dashboard. Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me conclude by saying that we're very pleased with the transformation that is occurring at Hologic. But at the same time, we recognize that fiscal 2015 is in the rear-view mirror, effective immediately. As our results have shown, we've made good progress in some areas, such as commercial execution in the United States, but in many other parts of the company, we have just begun to put points on the board. So as we strive for sustainable growth, we'll focus ensuring up our strengths while also addressing our opportunities. That will be a lot of fun, and I'm excited to continue the journey. Now, I will hand the call over to Bob. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to review the rest of our fourth quarter income statement, the balance sheet, and our initial financial guidance for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary will focus on non-GAAP results, excluding the Roka benefit from last year, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Steve described, we again demonstrated impressive top line growth in the fourth quarter, with double-digit revenue increases both in the U.S. and abroad on a constant currency basis. In addition, our bottom line continued to grow faster than sales. Margin improvement at the gross and operating levels contributed to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43, 13.2% higher than in the prior year period despite headwinds from both currency and share account. Digging into the income statement, our fourth quarter gross margin of 64.6% was strong, and up 100 basis points compared to the prior year period. Both geographic and product mix contributed to this increase. In the U.S., where margins tend to be higher, sales increased a very healthy 12.2%, and in terms of product mix, gross margin was fueled by increased adoption of Genius 3D mammography and our Aptima women's health assays, combined with stabilization of our ThinPrep and NovaSure products. Total operating expenses of $218.7 million increased by 9.9% in the fourth quarter. As a percent of sales, operating expenses remained flat compared to a year ago. The primary driver of the absolute increase was sales and marketing expense, which increased 15.1% as we continue to invest in our Genius 3D mammography campaign as well as Diagnostics marketing. Even as we reinvested in our growth drivers, we generated non-GAAP operating margin of 33.5% in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points from last year. We remain one of the most profitable companies among our peers and intend to stay that way. Now let me turn to cash flows and the balance sheet. From a financial perspective, one of the great strengths of Hologic is the tremendous amount of cash we generate. In 2015, we generated $786 million of operating cash, while needing to invest only $89 million in capital. And nearly half of that CapEx was spent on instruments for reagent rentals in Diagnostics, meaning it was directly revenue-generating. Not only do we have profitable products, we are working hard to be more efficient with our working capital, and that effort has boosted cash flows as well. For example, inventory actually decreased in fiscal 2015 by 14.4% even as full-year sales increased by 9.9% on a constant currency basis. These strong cash flows provide us with tremendous financial flexibility. We have said many times before that we are committed to reducing the amount of debt we have, while also improving the quality of our debt. Earlier this year, for example, we refinanced both our bank loans and our high-yield bond, resulting in lower interest rates and less restrictive covenants. Our strong cash flows enabled us to further clean up our balance sheet in the fourth quarter. Specifically, we repurchased $300 million in principal of our most dilutive convertible notes for $543.7 million. We recognize that we paid a premium for these notes but if we keep executing on our business plan, we believe they would only get more expensive in the future. Repurchasing and retiring these convertible notes helped us reduce our total debt outstanding to $3.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, a decrease of $628 million compared to a year ago. And our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, now stands at 3.3 times. We are very much on track to meet or exceed our stated goal of reducing our leverage ratio to 2.5 times by the end of fiscal 2017. Despite the significant cash outlay for the convertible notes, we ended the year with $493 million in cash and a net-debt position of $3.1 billion. To wrap up the historical discussion, adjusted EBITDA was $250.9 million in the fourth quarter, up 10.5% compared to the prior year period. The combination of strong profit growth and lower debt has enabled us to significantly improve our return on invested capital. As of year-end, ROIC was 10.9% on a trailing 12-month basis, a 160-basis-point increase over the prior year. Overall, we reported a very good fourth quarter, which clearly illustrated the strength of our business model and the progress we've made toward our financial goals : grow the top line, reinvest in the business, find efficiencies so profits can grow even faster, generate lots of cash, and deleverage. A simple formula but one that's paid off for the company and our shareholders over this last year. Now, I'd like to shift gears and provide our initial non-GAAP financial guidance for the 2016 fiscal year. As always, this guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates. In our guidance, you will see many of the same financial themes I just described. As we alluded to last quarter, we are forecasting mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth in 2016 on top of increasingly challenging comps. And we expect increased profitability and balance sheet improvements to enable us to grow EPS, at roughly a low double-digit rate, significantly faster than revenue. Specifically for the 2016 fiscal year and on a reported basis, we expect total revenues of $2.81 billion to $2.84 billion. Compared to the prior year, this equates to constant currency growth of between 4.4% and 5.5%, with reported revenue growth being between 3.9% and 5%. In terms of the components of this growth, we expect Breast Health and our Genius 3D mammography product to once again lead the charge. We forecast that total Breast Health revenues will grow about 10%, with breast imaging higher than that. We anticipate mid- to high-single-digit growth from our Surgical business, reflecting its dramatic turnaround and high-single-digit growth from our Skeletal products. We expect Diagnostics to grow in the low single-digits as we have annualized the growth benefits of our blood screening business with the Japanese Red Cross. I should point out that our revenue guidance incorporates roughly a $16 million headwind from various products and product lines that we have either divested or recently decided to discontinue. In other words, our guidance would have been about 60 basis points higher if these products were to be sold in 2016. Working down the income statement, we expect improvements in both gross margin percentage and operating expenses as a percent of sales, leading to a better operating margin compared to 2015. We are pleased to be able to increase what are already sector-leading margins, while also investing appropriately in future growth drivers. All this works out to non-GAAP earnings per share for the full year of between $1.80 and $1.84. This translates to EPS growth of 8.7% to 11.1% in constant currency terms, or reported EPS growth between 7.8% and 10.2%. So we expect to increase EPS at roughly twice the rate of sales growth. And as you know, net income is growing even faster than EPS as we continue to work through dilution caused by our convertible notes. This guidance assumes a full-year tax rate of approximately 34% and diluted shares outstanding of between 302 million and 305 million for the year. Now, turning to guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues of $680 million to $690 million. Compared to the prior year period, this range reflects revenue growth of 5.7% to 7.2% on a constant currency basis and reported revenue growth of 4.2% to 5.7%. Obviously, our first quarter guidance is down sequentially compared to our actual fourth quarter results. This is due to three factors. First, we have 3% fewer shipping days in the first quarter than in the fourth. Second, most of our mammography customers, as well as many of our Breast Health sales reps in the U.S., will attend the RSNA conference in Chicago, costing us a week of installations. And finally, both our U.S. and international sales meetings take place in the first quarter, pulling reps out of the field. In terms of the bottom line, we forecast diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.41 to $0.42 in the first quarter. This represents anticipated growth of 7.7% to 10.3% in constant currency terms, or 5.1% to 7.7% on a reported basis. Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that our fourth quarter results capped off what has been a tremendous year for the company. Our commercial teams executed on the delivery of best-in-class products and we are building a foundation for sustainable growth. Building on our strong top line, we improved our profitability and reduced our debt. Based on these successes, we have a lot to look forward to in 2016. Financially, we believe this includes mid-single-digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis and low double-digit EPS growth. With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up and then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, guys. Congrats on another terrific quarter. Maybe one clarification first on the guidance. So it looks like you're guiding to, by my math, somewhere between 70 bps to 100 bps of operating margin expansion. Is that what's baked into the guidance, because I'm not sure the below the line what the interest expense looks like, right, just given the debt refi. So I just want to make sure that we're modeling this the right way on the margin line? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. So Vijay, this is Bob. Yeah, so what we are seeing \u2013 first, I'll give some clarity around the interest expense. It's roughly $18 million year-on-year benefit associated with the refinancing of both our term loan and the high yield bond. And so your math is \u2013 your quick math is pretty accurate in terms of operating margin improvement for next year. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Great. And then maybe one for Steve. I mean it really is terrific, right, this turnaround, and Diagnostics \u2013 if I just had to sum up sort of what you've been saying and what your peers are saying, right. Some of your peers are still looking at cytology and looking at headwinds from the interval expansion for Pap smear testing. And looks like you're clearly gaining share, so I'm just wondering how much room do we have for this share gains, right. What innings are we in, and as we look towards the pipeline, is there something else that we can look forward to on the diagnostic side. Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Vijay. We do feel good that we're fighting through the interval expansion with some share gains in the U.S. We're probably getting pretty far into the innings on how much share we can take there, but there is still opportunities. We're still getting reports every month of little wins here and there on the edges. So I think we're incredibly enthused by the progress both in the U.S., but also starting to try to get that business cranked up internationally. Eric Compton, when he came into the company, really started saying we love ThinPrep and starting to get the team re-energized around that business; and the division leadership, they've all rallied behind it. So I think we feel pretty good. And then on the pipeline stuff, as you know, we've announced the Panther Fusion project that is still probably a couple of years away from coming to market, but we're excited by that. And really, the closer-in piece will be the viral load, and we did just get HCV cleared effectively with our CE Marking, so I think we're going to be able to start to go into the O.U.S markets a little bit this year and then, obviously, filing for that in the United States to hopefully be hitting in that late 2017, 2018 timeframe. So starting to get excited about just the market potential that that will open up for us, which is effectively as large or larger than the total market we play in today. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks. It's actually Joel Kaufman in here for Isaac. To start, just a quick one on tomo. You guys have said that you were looking to achieve higher share for this product cycle than you did in 2D. Just how is that progressing and then where do you guys see the best opportunities to gain share either by customer group or by geography? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, Joel. I think as \u2013 we've gained we've estimated about 300 basis points of share this year, probably moved it by our best estimates from about 57% up to about 60%. And that's on the installed base, which probably suggests share of new installs is probably even higher. So we're seeing opportunities \u2013 first off, geographically, let's call one geography the United States. We see it still as a significant opportunity in small hospitals, big hospitals, teaching institutions, all of our existing customers. Frankly, we're opening up new doors and getting discussions in accounts we haven't been penetrated in before. So, I think, feeling great about the U.S. opportunities, and just in the early stages of really starting to get more serious about our international opportunities as well, where we're still sizeable but, candidly, under-developed and don't have nearly the market shares abroad as we do here. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. I think just to build on that, Steve, I think one of the things that's exciting, certainly in the U.S., Steve mentioned that we're roughly only 30% penetrated into our own installed base. That would translate into being even much lower than that in terms of total 3D opportunities; and so, as we gain share, we feel really good about both the near- and medium- and long-term opportunities to convert and gain share both in the U.S. and then outside the U.S. as well. Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. And then maybe just one on Surgical, regarding the M&A landscape, do you guys feel better or worse about the opportunities you have there to bolt on some complementary assets? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: I think we feel pretty good. It's hard to say better or worse. I think in a simple thing, simple way to look at is we kind of blew up the business development, acquisition activities when I arrived at the company almost two years ago. We've now got teams back in place that we're looking divisionally for the opportunities and Surgical is clearly an area that would be a great tuck-in acquisition opportunity for us. So we've rebuilt the team there to be focused on that as well. Operator : And we'll move to our next question, from Jon Groberg with UBS. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Hi, Jon. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Can you hear me okay? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Congratulations on a solid quarter. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Thanks. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : So can you \u2013 Steve, can you, you know, you ended in the U.S. with 2,400 Genius systems. I don't know, do you have a target that you are shooting towards in fiscal 2016 at for Genius? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Higher than where we ended the current year \u2013 no, not exactly but we told you effectively what we did in the fourth quarter here; we would certainly want to be continuing \u2013 call it at that trajectory or whatever as we go into the year. So, but I think all of it points out \u2013 there's still a long way to go, years' worth of penetration here. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : (33:00) within your guidance that you gave there's not a specific number you guys are targeting? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: No. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Not that we want to divulge. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then my second kind of follow up there is, Steve, when you are investing more on R&D, I know you mentioned on the Diagnostic side some of the things that you're working on. Within Breast Health in particular and some of the dynamics you talked about going on within the country, how important is it for you to explore alternative screening technologies, or how are you thinking about that here at AMP (33:34) for example, there's a lot of excitement around things like liquid biopsies, and I'm just kind of curious how you guys were starting to evaluate that? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, I think \u2013 we think we're fairly uniquely poised as a company when you think about we've got obviously the digital imaging from our Breast Health business. We also have a great molecular diagnostics business. Combined with, frankly, ThinPrep, the cytology business, it's really different modes of diagnostics and all largely in the women's health space for the most part. Part of what we're doing and really driving across the divisions is the R&D organizations looking both how we improve what we have but also starting to look at what can those emerging areas be that maybe between or off sheets of the existing technologies today. So I feel a lot better today than I did even six months ago around our \u2013 and certainly better than 12 months ago around our capabilities to start to get a lot more serious in a lot of these emerging areas. You think about it at the highest level, year one was just put the wheels back on the bus, and year two here has been really starting to build some great R&D capabilities again; and we're early stages, but Bob, Eric, and I have been out meeting with the divisions just over the last month or so, and I'd tell you it's the first time I'm starting to be much more excited about what's coming \u2013 still several years out but some better things coming in the pipeline. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Co. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, Doug. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: So, appreciate the additional data on the Genius installed base, shipments in the quarter, market share, and market penetration. Clearly, there is plenty of room to grow. Beyond additional Genius placements, is there a meaningful opportunity to generate revenue on placements made in fiscal 2015 that have not been yet 3D-enabled? So that's really the first question. And then the related second question is, as we think ahead a few years out when the 3D market becomes a lot more penetrated and the opportunity to place more boxes becomes a little smaller, is there an opportunity for Hologic to be more successful with the service contract attachment rate with Genius than, say, the company was in the past with 2D. And if so, are there any early signs or initiatives that are ongoing that would position you to generate essentially more recurring revenues in breast imaging over the long-term? Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. I'll try to make sure, I nail the first part of that which was, in 2015, I would tell you, most of what we sold domestically was 3D, so probably not a lot of additional revenue other than those service contracts that will kick in. And I'd tell you \u2013 I think we feel pretty good both about our attach rate as well as the service business that is growing nicely and, frankly, will be a great longer-term piece. And candidly, when you look at it, our service business today is about as big as the capital business of our breast imaging business. It's become a sizable chunk and will contribute exactly to that recurring revenue stream going forward. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, Doug, let me give you a little more \u2013 some of the specifics around our existing 2D installed base. So the good news for us is the vast majority of those are actually not upgradeable. And so we think that that will actually convert \u2013 a full conversion. So as you know, we do have a software upgrade; that's roughly 20% of our existing 2D installed base that would be software upgradeable. The rest we believe are going to be full conversions. And to build on what Steve talked about, obviously, the installations of the products that came in 2015, we have roughly a year's worth of warranty so that will then show up as a contract \u2013 service contract, as Steve mentioned, in 2016 and beyond. I think the one other thing ... Operator : Your next question is from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Bob, do you want to go ahead before I ask my question? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: No, no, go ahead. Go ahead. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: It can't be as important as your question, David. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I find that very hard to believe, but thanks, Steve. Thanks for the confidence. So guys, I wanted to come back to guidance here for a second. So and one for Bob, maybe here one for Steve. So optically, you're guiding to half the growth rate in 2016 over 2015, which is slightly below the Street at the midpoint. So I guess, number one, can you give us more detail on these discontinued products, because I think if you adjust for those, you kind of get back to the Street consensus, constant currency at the midpoint. And just a second question for Steve, more broadly, kind of less technical, just given the momentum you described off the fourth quarter, why is 5% or sort of half the growth rate in 2016 versus 2015 the right number? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, I'll take the first and then I'll let Steve answer the second, and the biggest piece of that $16 million was actually the remainder of the Sentinelle business. We had divested that at the end of 2014. We did have some product that, as part of the transition services, that kind of tailed into 2015. That is now finished and complete, and there is some other small ancillary products in our Breast Health business that we just recently talked about, but those are the two big components of that, the $16 million that I referenced. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, and to pick up on it, David, I'd probably come at it two different ways as we think about the guidance for this year. One is, I'd say the macro economy, it gets so easy as you know and we've all watched companies that have a few good quarters and start to get a little ahead of themselves, and as you know we've work too hard to get this company turned around and want to make sure that we continue to deliver on our commitments. So that's certainly a macro approach to how we want to set guidance, and you've seen it, even at your conference a couple of months ago, us just \u2013 while it's fun to watch the investors get so ebullient and start to think about us as a double-digit revenue company, we still know we have work to do to really get there, and, gosh knows, we'd aspire to it, but we're not quite there yet. The other simple piece, if you just kind of break it down maybe a little more analytically from the ground up, this year we ended up probably getting 1.5% in the Japanese Red Cross. That all came through, and if anything, frankly, there was some pipeline build that this year the blood screening might be a slight headwind. So that's probably almost a 2-percentage-point dip, say, versus last year in terms of growth. The 60 basis points that Bob just mentioned in terms of the discontinued items, and then I'd say, just generally, we're going off some pretty hefty comps. Three straight quarters of double-digit growth in our Surgical business, that now, just to jump over those numbers, starting to get pretty big. As well as the Breast Health business, we're coming off a couple of quarters in a row of 20%. So those 20% growth quarters led us to the very high single-digit growth this year. Hard to believe we're going to still have 20% growth on top of 20%. Probably the final piece, I would remind you is, and you've certainly mentioned it, relative to our original guidance for this year, we feel very good that we went way past that I don't see us going that far past it again next year. Now that we \u2013 I think we've got a much better handle on the business, but we still want to make sure we're putting numbers out that we feel very confident in being able to hit. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Maybe just first on the international build. I know you've talked about a number of opportunities going maybe more direct in Breast Health in some markets. You're obviously going to have virology in Europe and then with Surgical maybe pushing more in Lat-Am and in Canada and places. Can you maybe just talk from a resourcing perspective where you're putting more feet on the ground and what we can maybe monitor externally in 2016? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, Tycho. It's still like the first inning of most of those things because we're just getting the capabilities and even things like the ability to go direct. Frankly, we have a lot of great dealers around and a lot of long-term contract, so we're really looking franchise by franchise as to how best to attack this; and I think, as we've been starting to say, the international build-out is one that's going to really play out over time, and we're feeling certainly encouraged by the fourth quarter results, encouraged in general by the progress, but we still got a long, long way to go and are still in the very, very early innings. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And maybe on the manufacturing side, should we expect some news in terms of shifting more of the manufacturing offshore? How do we think about that now that you've freed up some of the IP covenants? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: You know, very minimal. First off, we're making some nice progress on our gross margins. We also, obviously, quality is a big deal, and before we start moving manufacturing around or anything else, we want to make sure that we are doing. Having said that, we are closing our Bedford facility, so kind of \u2013 which makes our Skeletal products \u2013 and we're moving some of that. So we've been setting things up, but we'll be very deliberate in how we proceed here. Our big piece, and I think we are showing a lot of great operational improvements. As Bob said, one of the quiet strengths of the year is we reduced inventory by over $40 million in a year that we grew the top line, by $200 million. So there's a lot of good work going on within our operational footprint. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. I think just to build on that, Steve, Tycho, in operations, there's really kind of a \u2013 in the near-term we have really a couple of opportunities that we're seizing upon and you're starting to see some of the early results, the first being around our sourcing and our strategy around procuring primarily our raw materials. Outside of the service, roughly 70% of our COGS is actually materials, so we've brought in a central procurement \u2013 or a chief procurement officer. She's bringing in some nice savings there as we leverage that. And I think also from our chief supply chain officer, really focused on driving efficiencies out of the plant. So as our volumes go up, obviously, we get to cover the overhead there, but also driving a much more efficient operation there. That's driving the results that you're seeing, and we still see that happening \u2013 and then as we grow internationally, I think that that's something that we would be looking at, but that \u2013 to Steve's point, that's probably more of a long-term piece. Operator : And we'll move to our next question from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I just want to ask a couple on Diagnostics, which is \u2013 I mean, we obviously with AMP now. Just one \u2013 wondered if you had an update on Panther placements and then just the thoughts around the trajectory and how things looked heading into the next fiscal year? Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Jack. Yeah, it's Mike. So a little bit of an update on the numbers there. I think we said in our last call, last quarter that we had exceeded our goal of 1,000 shipments, so that was encouraging. Would tell you that we had a very good quarter in the fourth quarter as well, particularly outside the United States, so perhaps that is some green shoots for future growth down the road. But pleased with the number of placements. An increasing percentage of those now are competitive, as you can imagine, as our existing business on the DTS is pretty small now. So, good number of wins and good competitive share as well. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. And then just maybe one for Bob. I might have missed the number you threw out for guidance, just around the revenue growth in the Diagnostics business. You get blood screening could be a little modest headwind next year. Just wondering if there are any other moving parts to keep in mind? Thanks. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. So, what we \u2013 what we had said, Jack, was kind of low single digits for the Diagnostics business as a whole on a constant currency basis. And we did talk about the benefits of the blood, the Japanese Red Cross win in blood screening have anniversaried themselves here in the fourth quarter; and we saw that growth, where it was significant double-digit growth in the first three quarters, it was roughly 2% in the fourth quarter. So as we look at that, given continued business here in the U.S., we feel good about kind of the placements and so forth, but that's kind of what our forecast incorporates. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Laura Sand - Piper Jaffray & Company: Great, thanks. This is actually Laura Sand, on for Bill Quirk today. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: All right. Hi, Laura. Laura Sand - Piper Jaffray & Company: Hi. In terms of the surgical business that continues to show a strong rebound, can you help us think about the sustainability of the NovaSure turnaround? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, I think we feel good that we've turned that business from a decliner to basically a flat to ever so slightly growing business; probably that's about what we should expect going forward and I think we see MyoSure continuing to be a very strong grower. So, feeling pretty good still about the trajectory of the surgical business. Laura Sand - Piper Jaffray & Company: Okay, great. And then returning to the international business for a moment, can you talk to the pacing of this effort and how should we think about the incremental top line contribution as well as potential tax benefits over the next couple of years? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, I think, probably it's going to be a similar growth rate to the U.S. for still the next couple of years. Longer term, we would certainly want it to be outpacing the U.S. given the underdevelopment, but we're not there yet. And in terms of the tax rate, ergo, the U.S. is still a big chunk of our business and still growing very strong, so you're probably not going to see much tax rate improvement, really, still for another year or two. We're putting all of the pieces in place and, Bob, I don't know if you want to add to that. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: No, you're absolutely right, Steve. Laura, the guidance that we put out for fiscal 2016 has a tax rate of roughly 34%, which is roughly where we ended up 2015 and we would expect some of that to start coming in, in the 2017 timeframe if you will. Operator : And we'll move next to Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and I apologize for the background noise. Can you guys talk a little bit about pricing, both in the U.S. and O.U.S., what you saw in 2015 and what you're thinking about 2016, and maybe break that down a little bit by kind of key product and how we should be thinking about pricing? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, hey, Brian, this is Bob. I think we feel \u2013 we continue to feel pretty good about the resiliency of our pricing, to give you a perspective, certainly in our mammography business despite the additional competition that started at the beginning of our fiscal year and then with Siemens coming in. If you looked at our fourth quarter ASPs domestically, they were roughly flat versus year ago. And I would say in our Diagnostics business, in our key assays, generally flat to maybe very modest declines. Some of that may be just a result of kind of deteriorating pricing and so forth as volumes go up. But we've been very pleased with the discipline that we've put in place here in the U.S. across our major products. And that would also hold true within our surgical business. It was a \u2013 there's some mix, but basically flat in those businesses. Internationally, I think there are obviously lower prices, one, because of the business model that we have with the dealers. But also just generally, the macro economic situation outside the U.S., generally, lower prices. But, again, nothing materially changed year-on-year, and we're not projecting any material change going forward in our guidance either. Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just as far as use of cash, to make sure that I'm clear on this. Any kind of use of cash would be first debt paydown, then buyback of some of the high-yield stuff, and then maybe some tuck-in stuff. Is that the way to think about, the way you guys are thinking about using your cash next year? Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Very well said, Brian. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: Great. Next, operator? Operator : And we'll take our next question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Unknown Speaker : Hi, guys. It's Ann, calling in for Derik. So the first question that I have is regarding gross margin expectation for next year. I mean, I think you'll continue to see the benefit from the rich mix. So can you just talk about expectations there? And then the second question is on the Diagnostic side. I think you mentioned that you're driving better utilization of your installed Panther base. So how are you doing that and what should we expect going forward; will that trend continue? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Ann, this is Bob. I'll take the first one. So, Vijay asked a question about margin improvement, roughly 70 to 100 basis points. I think that math is in the ballpark, and I would say the majority of that improvement is in fact in our gross margin, if you look at it year-on-year. We do expect some operating expense improvement and we've said in the past, small basis points, we intend to reinvest primarily in places like our marketing efforts. We've had a lot of great progress primarily in the work that we've been doing behind our Genius 3D campaign. It's really driving not only awareness but also patient demand and we want to continue that in 2016. Then we're also investing some in Diagnostics marketing, as well as in our (53:18). So that's how you should think about kind of the margin improvement built into our guidance. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good evening and thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a couple. On MyoSure, the growth there continues to be stellar. I'm just wondering, do you think you're benefiting from the withdrawal of the power morcellator last year? And then just as a related follow-up, is there any way to kind of frame the market opportunity for MyoSure just to gauge kind of the sustainability of this growth? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, Jayson. Thanks. We don't think we're really benefiting. It's still really two very different procedures. I think the only word they might have in common is morcellation, but at the end of the day, we just think MyoSure is a great procedure, a great product. Not \u2013 we're probably not ready to define exactly the market size, because I think it's turning out to be bigger than a number we might have put out there at the beginning. So I think there is clearly still runway when you look at, if anything, our growth rate actually accelerated off of a larger base in 2015 than it did in 2014. And that's another one, too, where we're still very early stages, internationally as well, on that business, so a lot of opportunity ahead. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on another strong quarter. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: I would love to hear your comments on direct-to-marketing \u2013 excuse me, direct-to-consumer marketing in the Breast Health business. Obviously, it's something you've talked a lot about in the U.S. market, but as we think about the international markets, how much are you doing in Europe today and to what extent do you think direct-to-consumer marketing can step up, especially in Europe? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, Mark. We're effectively doing none outside of the U.S. It's \u2013 we've really \u2013 our marketing team, even as a company, is really only about a year old, and I think we've made tremendous progress learning a lot in the U.S. There is a lot more that we've got to figure out as we penetrate internationally, just from a regulation, a customer reaction, and everything else, so I'd say it may be something we start to wade into a little bit in the current year, but probably not nearly the driver of growth that it's been in the United States, particularly as you think about it, the biggest piece, a) it's been great to patients, but b) what it's really done is the patients have been going to the hospitals, they've been asking for our product by name. It's really precipitated the hospitals buying it, and I think we just \u2013 still most of the countries outside the U.S., patients just are still not ready, probably, to drive that kind of behavior nor are the hospitals geared to probably accept it, but we'll be looking in opportunistically for areas where we might be able to, but I'd suggest it's going to be very minor. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. And I know that tax rate is an initiative for you. I may have missed it. What do you expect to do for tax rate in 2016, and when do you think you might be able to benefit from relocating to other jurisdictions? Is that potentially a 2016 event or what are some of the moving parts there? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. So \u2013 hey, Mark, this is Bob. Our guidance for 2016 is a tax rate roughly of 34%, and that's effectively the same as what we had in 2015, but I will tell you, we were working feverishly to try to get that done as soon as possible, but it's still \u2013 it's a ways out. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. It's going to play out longer-term on the tax rate. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: That's right. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Great. Time for one more question, I think. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Jon Block with Stifel. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, guys, and thank you, really, for squeezing me in. I think just first on the competitive wins on tomo, you know, 300 basis points of share is a big number in a year, and I'm thinking your 2D base is probably hard to poach. You've got the better label, the faster scan times; can you just talk a little bit, Steve, about how your reps are incentivized? I mean, is there a kicker for a competitive win so that they might be hunting there first in the market? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. We've not put necessarily kickers in for competitive, but our reps are seeing the opportunities and going out after them. We did tweak our compensation plans for last year, and I think they have effectively provided more upside for especially are best performers, and I think we've seen a hungrier, more aggressive sales force kicking in here in 2015 that we think will continue in 2016, both upgrading our existing base, but also, I think we're seeing a lot more activity among competitive users than we've ever seen before. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And lastly, just to stick with mammography, more clarification. I think did you mention the backlog was at an all-time high? Did I hear you correctly, and if so, was that specific to U.S. or was that a global number? Thanks, guys. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: You did hear it correctly. It is at an all-time high, most of it driven by the U.S., candidly, so feeling very good about that. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: So with that, operator, I think we're all set. Thank you, everybody, for tuning in. We feel, obviously, a great year behind us, and we're on to 2016. Thank you. Operator : This now concludes Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call.

My name is Cassandra and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Mike Watts : Thank you, Cassandra. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's first quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks; then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our Web site, we also will post our prepared remarks to our Web site shortly after we deliver them this afternoon. Finally, a replay of the call will be archived on our Web site through February 26. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known as well as unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's in our press release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation from GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Steve MacMillan : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. We are very pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In short, the company is off to a good start to the year. We are executing on our key top-line growth drivers and exceeding expectations on the bottom-line based on the tremendous earnings power of the company, which has become even stronger over time than I initially thought possible. In the first quarter, total revenue grew 8.1% in constant currency terms driven by double-digit growth in the United States, our largest and most profitable market. Our U.S. businesses have turned around more rapidly than anyone anticipated based on better commercial execution and the quality of our products. And over the last few quarters, our domestic sales and marketing teams have kicked it up a notch generating robust growth from our key brands. This commercial improvement has led to significant benefits up and down our income statement. For example, in the first quarter, we posted non-GAAP gross and operating margins that were significantly higher than in the prior year period. We are clearly demonstrating that despite our already sector leading profitability, we can generate additional operating leverage by driving the growth of our most profitable products. Working down the income statement, earnings per share were $0.46 in the first quarter beating our expectations again. In addition, we increased EPS at a pace that was nearly 3x the rate of revenue growth. With that introduction, let me discuss the details of our first quarter revenue performance. Then Bob will take you through the rest of the income statement, the balance sheet and our updated guidance. Total revenues were $695.2 million in the first quarter, an increase of 6.5% on a reported basis and 8.1% in constant currency terms. Geographically, our U.S. businesses performed exceptionally well in the quarter. We posted 12.8% revenue growth domestically, a slight acceleration over the fourth quarter despite a more difficult comp. The strong U.S. performance outweighed what was a mixed bag internationally in the first quarter. We showed good continued progress in cytology, molecular diagnostics and surgical outside the United States. In constant currency terms, cytology grew high single-digit, molecular posted modest growth for the second consecutive quarter. And surgical grew in the mid-teens albeit from a small base. In contrast, we saw weakness in our international blood screening business which was largely expected and which resulted mainly from fluctuations in ordering patterns by our commercial partner Grifols. In addition, our international breast health results confirmed as we've highlighted before that we are a long way from optimizing our relationships with our dealers and distributors. Lower breast health and blood screening sales OUS contributed to total international sales declining a 11.5% in the quarter or 5.4% in constant currency terms. We are moving decisively to strengthen the international breast business drawing on the same tool kit that we employed to turnaround our domestic franchises. We are unifying leadership of all global commercial activities under our COO, Eric Compton. So that we may share some of our U.S. best practices internationally. As part of this process, our head of international has left the company along with our head of European breast health sales. In their place, Eric is diving deep to optimize our go-to-market strategy in key markets around the globe. We are highly focused on identifying the right commercial model for each country in each we operate, while there maybe some short-term volatility, we remain bullish on our international opportunities in breast health and we look forward to sharing more details about our plans as they come together. Now, let's provide some more color on our divisional revenue performance in the first quarter. Our biggest division Diagnostics, posted sales of $310.7 million in the quarter, a growth rate of 3.7% in constant currency terms. But the three franchises within diagnostics demonstrated very different results. In molecular diagnostics and cytology, where we controlled the commercial channel, our results were very good. But blood screening sales declined. Let's discuss each piece in turn. In molecular diagnostics, quarterly sales of $129.6 million increased 9.9% in constant currency, our best growth rate since the Gen-Probe acquisition. Domestic revenues increased a stellar 11.5% and the formula was similar to recent quarters, strong placements of our fully automated Panther instrument, a healthy number of competitive wins and growing utilization of our women's health assays. We said at a recent healthcare conference that the average Panther system globally now generates more than a $170,000 in annual assay revenue despite being less than 30% utilized, this demonstrates both the current value of the system and it's future potential for customers and Hologic as we add new test for viral load and other targets in the years ahead. Outside the United States, sales of our molecular diagnostics products grew nominally on a constant currency basis for the second consecutive quarter as the business stabilizes after an extended period of decline. We are also pleased with the performance of ThinPrep, one of our largest and most profitable franchises. Global sales of cytology and perinatal products totaled a $120.4 million in the first quarter. U.S. sales actually increased by a modest 0.5% as market share gains more than offset headwinds from longer screening intervals. And internationally, we are encouraged that revenue grew 8.7% in constant currency. This drove global growth of 3.1%, our second consecutive quarter of decent constant currency growth. Our commercial team deserves much credit for transforming a business that was declining at a high single digit rate as recently as 2014 into a modest grower globally. In blood screening, worldwide sales were $60.7 million in the first quarter. This was roughly flat sequentially as sales have normalized without the benefit of growth from the Japanese Red Cross contract. Compared to the prior year, however, blood screening sales declined 6.5% on a constant currency basis. This reflects heavier ordering by our partner Grifols a year ago and general declines in blood usage that we are seeing in the United States and other markets. Now, let's turn to Breast Health where we continue to see strong adoption of our Genius 3D mammography exams in the United States. Domestic sales of breast imaging product including our Genius systems increased 18.7% compared to the 8.9% constant currency decline we saw internationally. Global sales of interventional breast products increased slightly on a constant currency basis and we are optimistic that new products will help stimulate growth in this category over the next couple of years. All of this added up to total breast health sales of $262.2 million in the quarter up 9.9% in constant currency terms. We also remain enthusiastic about our future prospects in the mammography market. We continue to gain share in the United States based on a superior product profile and excellent customer service. Our prices are stable despite increasing competition, which indicates that our marketing programs are working and that our systems are providing value to customers. And congressional action is prohibited any near term insurance changes arising from the controversial screening recommendations by the USPSTF. All-in-all, we've a lengthy runway ahead of us to continue upgrading older less effective technologies to our Genius 3D exams. To round out the revenue discussion, we are thrilled with the progress being made by our surgical team. Although the December quarter is typically a seasonally strong one, we certainly did not predict sales of $98.8 million or a constant currency growth rate of 18.8%. These are truly outstanding results, our best overall performance in the last several years. So congratulations to the commercial teams and new leaders who are making it happen. It's worth mentioning that surgical is Hologic's most profitable division on a gross and operating margin basis. So the magnitude of the top-line growth we're now seeing is having a nice positive impact on the company's gross and operating margins as well as earnings per share. Specifically, our MyoSure product for hysteroscopic tissue removal posted total revenue of $36.9 million in the first quarter with accelerating growth of 46.1% in constant currency terms. Equally impressive, global NovaSure sales of $61.7 million increased by 7.5% on a constant currency basis. We do believe NovaSure sales benefited from the recall of a competitive product but estimate that this benefit was relatively small in the context of overall quarterly sales. Finally, worldwide Skeletal sales were $23.5 million in the quarter, an increase of 7.7% on a constant currency basis driven by continued growth of our new horizon bone density scanner a very solid performance. Before, I turn the call over to Bob; let me conclude by saying that this quarter illustrates the value that our portfolio of products can provide to shareholders. Although breast health and blood screening declined outside the United States, we more than compensated by posting strong growth in mammography, molecular diagnostics and surgical. The net effect was top-line performance slightly ahead of expectations and a significant increase in profitability. All-in-all, we are off to a good start in 2016 and remain excited about the future. Now, I'll hand the call over to Bob. Bob McMahon : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to walk through the rest of our first quarter income statement, the balance sheet, and our updated financial guidance for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Steve mentioned, we delivered another solid quarter on the top-line with 12.8% sales growth in the U.S. more than offsetting the international choppiness we saw in breast health and blood screening. Strength in domestic revenue combined with the early returns of our productivity efforts help drive margin improvement at the gross and operating levels contributing to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.46, a 17.9% increase over the prior year period. Even with headwinds from share count and currency EPS grew at a rate nearly 3x faster than sales. Moving down the income statement, our first quarter gross margin of 65.2% increased a 190 basis points compared to the prior year period. Gross margin benefited from mix both geographic and product and from our cost reduction initiatives. Not only did revenue grow at a double-digit rate in the U.S., some of our highest margin products also performed well including our ThinPrep, NovaSure and Aptima franchise. And I should point out that pricing remains stable across our product lines as our commercial team is focused on selling the clinical and economic value that our products provide. In addition, our operations and procurement teams are executing well driving efficiencies and reducing the cost to make our products. Total operating expenses of $221 million increased by 11.3% in the first quarter. This increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expense which increased 15.6%. We continued to invest to extend our leadership in the mammography market and to explain why co-testing the best way to protect women from cervical cancer. Despite these investments better growth margins drove profitability improvement down to the operating line. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.4% in the quarter, an increase of 50 basis points from last year. Although our operating margin has already among the highest in our sector, the last several quarters have clearly demonstrated that they can expand further even as we fund key growth drivers. Moving further down the income statement, we are beginning to reap the benefits of our efforts to reduce and refinance debt. In the first quarter, interest expense was $32.8 million a reduction of 25% versus the prior year period. In addition, we are pleased that a lot of hard work to reduce our tax rate has begun to payoff earlier than expected. We now estimate that our effective tax rate will be around 33% in fiscal 2016 lower than our initial guidance and this added about a $0.01 to EPS in the first quarter. Although, this is just a first step in our multiyear tax improvement strategy, we are encouraged by the progress we've made so far. Finally, diluted shares outstanding were $292 million in the first quarter. As you know, we are focused on minimizing share count dilution by eliminating the convertible notes from our capital structure. In the fourth quarter for example, we repurchased $300 million in principle of our most dilutive convertible notes. And this had a beneficial effect on share count in the first quarter. In addition, the recent decline in our share price had the rather perverse effect of further reducing dilution from the converts. The combined effect boosted EPS by almost a $0.01 in the quarter. Now, let's talk about cash flows and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow was strong again in the first quarter at a $164.3 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year period. We spent $19.7 million on capital in the quarter leading the free cash flow of $144.6 million. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the first fiscal quarter with $650 million in cash, 19.5% improvement over the prior year period. This strong cash position provides us with dry powder for potential tuck-in acquisitions even as we continue to pay down debt. At the end of the first quarter, we had total debt outstanding of $3.6 billion, a decrease of $322 million compared to a year ago and net debt of $2.98 billion. Our leverage ratio net debt over EBITDA now stands at 3.1x and we are on track to achieve our goal of lowering our leverage ratio to 2.5x by the end of fiscal 2017. To wrap up the historical discussion, adjusted EBITDA was $252 million in the first quarter up 8.1% compared to the prior year period. And we are tracking to generate EBITDA of more than $1 billion for the full year. Our consistency in delivering strong profit growth and lowering debt as allowed us to steadily improve our return on invested capital. As of our first fiscal quarter, ROIC was 11.3% on a trailing 12-month basis, 160 basis point increase over the prior year. Now, let's shift gears and turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and second quarter. We are updating our guidance based on our solid performance in the first quarter, a stronger U.S. dollar and greater than expected earnings power. As always, this guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates. As you know, the dollar has strengthened since we provided our initial 2016 guidance, compared to last year; we now expect currency to represent a $25 million top-line headwind in 2016. This equates to roughly $0.03 in earnings per share. And importantly, compared to when we initially guided in November, the stronger dollar is subtracting an incremental $11 million from our top-line. So for the 2016 fiscal year, we are maintaining our guidance for constant currency growth of between 4.4% and 5.5%. But on a reported basis, we are updating our guidance to reflect the additional currency headwind. So based solely on the stronger dollar, we now expect reported revenues of $2.8 billion to $2.83 billion representing reported growth of 3.5% to 4.6%. As Steve said earlier, we continue to forecast improvements on both the gross and operating margin lines based on favorable geographic and product mix as well as early returns from our productivity efforts. In addition, as you probably read, the omnibus budget bill that was passed by congress in December included a 2-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax among other key provisions. We are thrilled that congress has recognized the negative effects of this tax on domestic innovation and job growth. In fiscal 2015, we paid $23.6 million under this tax which was reported under general and administrative expenses. It's important to note 2 points however. First, since the moratorium took effect on January 1, we only recognized three quarters of this benefit in our 2016 fiscal year. In addition, we plan to reinvest most of the benefit in some of our more attractive R&D and commercial programs. Continuing with our full year guidance, we now expect our effective tax rate to improve to approximately 33% for the year and believed diluted shares outstanding will total between $296 million and $298 million for the full year. Given these updates and our strong first quarter results, we are increasing our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. For the full year, we now expect EPS of $1.86 to $1.90. This translates to growth of 13.1% to 15.5% in constant currency terms or reported growth between 11.4% and 13.8%. So despite the currency and share count headwinds, we anticipate growing EPS more than double the rate of sales demonstrating bottom-line growth and operating leverage that seemed unlikely at best just a few quarters ago. Turning to guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues of $680 million to $690 million. Compared to the prior year period, this range reflects revenue growth of 4.5% to 6% on a constant currency basis and reported revenue growth of 3.7% to 5.3%. We expect a sequential decline in revenue for two main reasons. First, our surgical business is seasonally weakest in the March quarter, especially in comparison to the strength we saw on the December period. Second, we are allowing for some potential choppiness in our international business. In terms of the bottom-line, we forecast diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.45 to $0.46 in the second quarter. This represents growth of 11.2% to 13.6% in constant currency terms or 9.8% to 12.2% on a reported basis. It's worth mentioning that we anticipate a substantial R&D increase in spending in the second fiscal quarter based mainly on the timing of projects. Before opening the call for questions, I would like to reiterate that Hologic is off to a good start in 2016. In the first quarter, our momentum continued with Genius 3D mammography in our surgical and molecular diagnostic businesses priced to the upside. As a whole, our domestic business has performed great. These positives outweighed weaker than expected results in our international mammography business which we are dealing with aggressively. In the middle of the income statement, we are demonstrating the tremendous earnings power of the company by improving gross and operating margins and below the line, we are beginning to see the benefits from our efforts to reduce debt as well as our effective tax rate. With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up and then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to our first question from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Thanks. Steve, I guess I want to start on the international breast health where we have been getting a lot of questions on the decline. Can you maybe just walk through the extent of the dealer issues, how contained this is, how quickly you can work through it and what kind of cushion you are baking in for the remainder of the year? Steve MacMillan : Yes. On the wall of worry, Tycho, it's something we think about, I wouldn't be overly freaked out by it. I think the way we are thinking about it is, we got just about every business performing better than we expected. But I think the deeper we dug in the second half of the year and you continue to hear us say really going back a few quarters. Hey, we are probably closer to a start-up than a real turnaround here. And we have a lot of work to do even building our relationships with the dealers. And I think what -- as we go back and look at it, clearly, our fourth fiscal quarter was really strong and followed up a weaker quarter. And that's not what we want to be delivering and don't have that sustained relationship. So we are making some changes internally and we are not going to blame the dealers. We are going to always look at ourselves. And I will say that we need to be a little closer to it. But it's the only little piece of the puzzle, I think right now for us to continue to work on. And I will also say, I think we are all accustomed to not every business is always firing on every cylinder the day it does, we are probably in trouble. This is kind of one of our areas of opportunity. I think the next couple of quarters; we will probably be a little bit softer. We are going to plan for that while we get to the right longer term place. But as Eric -- as Eric Compton after his first reviews of it said it's -- obviously reminds him of a little bit of when he walked in the door of Hologic two years ago and some of the same rebuilding needs to occur. And things like pricing discipline and marketing, market access, just a lot of the fundamentals that we have never put in place. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And just a follow-up, the management changes you alluded to, are the changes done, do you have team in place now you need for Europe? Steve MacMillan : No. We are putting those in place. So we've exited a couple of people and we are in the process of putting new ones in. So that's why I think over the next quarter or two, price doubles, softness and that's basically what we've baked into our guidance. Operator : And we will go next to Jonathan Groberg of UBS. Jonathan Groberg : Great, thanks and congratulations on incredibly solid quarter. Obviously, a lot of questions on international breast health but you just answered some of those. So can you maybe talk a little bit about your -- looks like you know for the quarter, at least to start the year, your operating expenses grew quite a bit more than sales, kind of what's your expectation for OpEx growth for the year versus kind of gross margin for the year? Bob McMahon : Hi, Jon. This is Bob. So as we mentioned in our prepared remarks what we are looking at is actually is very strong performance on our gross margin basis combination of product and geography mix as well as some of the productivity efforts that we are doing. And we are looking to reinvest a portion of those. Our gross margin is probably operating a little better than what we had anticipated and we are looking to reinvest that in those growth drivers and places like our marketing and to a certain extent some of the R&D investments to drive that growth rate on the top-line. That being said, we are still expecting operating margin expansion consistent with that we had guided to in November and we believe that we are able to do that and we have demonstrated that certainly in the first quarter continued to have operating margin leverage and we expect that throughout the course of the rest of the year. Jonathan Groberg : So just a follow-up on that kind of tie it into the first part of the conversation around international, is it more about getting the right people, I know you thought you had the right person in your first hire, but is it more about getting the right people or is it more about throwing more money at the issue? And have you contemplated how -- is that kind of in your guidance now the outlook for -- how much you might need to spend in order to -- to get the start up going internationally? Steve MacMillan : It's all about the right people. It's not about spending Jonathan. So we will have it nailed. Operator : And we will go next to Jack Meehan of Barclays. Jack Meehan : Thanks and good afternoon. So just want to ask about the U.S. mammography business and just curious on your view for the landscape this year whether its hospital CapEx trends or the competitive dynamic just your view on the rate of placements from here? Steve MacMillan : Jack, we still feel really good. The U.S. says -- we said the U.S. breast imaging business was up 18.7% in the quarter. That's coming off of some pretty good comps and everything we are seeing and hearing. As we continue to feel we are making very good progress both with our own customers as well as competitive in-roads. And I think we feel as good if not better about that business and the fact that we are going to end up by the end of the 3D curve. I said early on we think we will end up with a little bit higher share than we started. And I think if we anything we feel better and better about that prediction and more and more confident everyday that goes by. We continue to hear great stories from our teams. Jack Meehan : Got it. And then just curious as you see hospitals taking on the new 3D units, do you still see them adding new capacity or you are seeing some replacements of 2D units as well? Steve MacMillan : It's largely replacement is the way to think about it. I don't think we see the number of gantries being significantly different at the end of the 3D curve versus where we are today. Operator : And we will go next to Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company. Doug Schenkel : Hey, good afternoon guys and thank you for taking my questions. Steve MacMillan : Hi, Doug. Doug Schenkel : I just want to cover really two topics. One is really just a math on guidance and then really the other topic is just on pricing in certain product categories. So first on, guidance, just to try to run through the waterfall, you beat earnings guidance at the high-end by $0.04 this quarter. You increased EPS guidance for the year at the mid-point by $0.06. We estimate lower share count gets you $0.03 to $0.05 and lower tax rate gets $0.03 to $0.04, so it seems like we might be missing something here. Is there a change in mix that you expect to occur or are there areas that maybe you're investing a little bit more in either in sales or R&D relative to your last guidance. Why don't I pause there and I will come back with the pricing question? Bob McMahon : Hey, Doug. This is Bob. You're generally on top of it for both the share count and the tax benefit. I think what the other piece that we alluded to -- the incremental headwind associated with FX. So if you think about the very -- at a very high level the tax and -- tax benefit and share count roughly we think about $0.06 offset by about $0.02 of FX and then we -- the operational beat in the Q1 like you said about $0.06 growth. Doug Schenkel : Gets you in the neighborhood. Okay. Bob McMahon : Yes. Doug Schenkel : And then on pricing really quickly, some of our recent checks suggest that there may have been a pick up with more aggressive pricing from competitors particularly in chlamydia and gonorrhea, CT/NG. Can you talk about if you are seeing anything that's really different from kind of the normal pricing pressures you see in the market and if there is -- basically what's baked into your guidance outlook for pricing changes in molecular? Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Yes. I will tell you. I think we feel as good as we felt since we have been here about pricing. And I think, we have got so much more discipline. I will tell you, we are hearing more and more competitive attempt frankly in both the molecular side as well as on the mammography side where there is some pretty big disparities and with Bob McMahon and Eric Compton's leadership in the divisional presidents, we have been doing a much better job of fighting on price -- not fighting on price, fighting on the features and benefits and not going down there. And it's part of the hidden piece and I think that we are seeing in our gross margin expansion. As we talk about the gross margin piece, it's clearly it's a -- the incredible progress we are making on the operational side. It's a mix benefit. But also frankly I think much better pricing discipline and we're holding pricing far better and in some cases getting a little bit of up ticks even in and what is a much more competitive environment. Operator : And we will go next to Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Hi, Isaac. Isaac Ro : Hi. How are you? Steve MacMillan : Good. Isaac Ro : Wanted to just maybe come back to the breast imaging comments that you guys touched on earlier. And wondering if you could put those in context with that we are seeing from the other major equipment player this quarter. And I'm specifically curious, if you are seeing any more signs of aggressive bundling or pricing practices from those players and whether or not that's a factor we should be considering in the market? Steve MacMillan : We are seeing it. And Isaac, I would tell you what I'm really, really proud of our team fighting it off. I think we are actually winning more based on the overall success of our business. The combination of our product, our label, the ease of use and our Genius marketing campaigns which frankly has probably been the single biggest differentiator of hospitals understanding. They are better aligned with us in the mammography space than with anybody else because we are driving patients to the hospitals that have our systems and I think it's been a dramatic step change in our own organizations ability to ward-off going down the pricing games. And I've heard more and more anecdotes of much bigger pricing discounts from competitors on accounts that we have not lost and in fact we have won. Bob McMahon : Yes. Just to build on that, Steve. I mean over the last 18 months we had two competitors come into a market where we were the sole competitor. We've not only maintained stable pricing but we gained share. I mean that\u2019s a huge credit to the -- our domestic breast health team led by Pete Valenti and that team, just tremendous job. Isaac Ro : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just several question on the balance sheet and M&A didn't come up so far this quarter, I'm curious if it's possible whether we might see you guys get in the marketplace this year where the tuck-in deal or two to augment the business. And if so kind of what -- how is the shopping list look, how would you characterize evaluations in deal funnel? Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Sure. Isaac, I think we are still in the earlier stages probably than I preferred to be on the true business development side. We have rebuild the capabilities aligned them with the divisions, I think the divisions are starting to look and starting to get the shopping list. But I put it really in, probably the first inning. And we started to look at a few things we said no to. I do think valuations are going to be our friend as we go forward and obviously, with the tremendous cash generation and getting our balance sheet cleaned up. We are going to be ready. I think our teams have been so focused on great commercial execution and getting the R&D pipelines back in shape that sort of the next piece that will start to play out. But we are probably still a little slower, so I wouldn't anticipate anything super quick on that front. Operator : And we will go next Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Bill Quirk : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon everybody. Steve MacMillan : Hey, Bill. Bill Quirk : Hi, there. First question, Bob, you mentioned that obviously there is a number of factors that help drive the gross margin improvement year-over-year and you alluded to the fact they were in kind of the early days from a supply chain standpoint. So I guess, two part question here, one, can you help break this down a little bit further in terms of what the contribution was from lining your supply chain? And then, again, I don't want to put words in your mouth, it sounds kind of really early days for this initiative? Steve MacMillan : Yes, we are. I'm not going to give you the level of specificity that you probably would like to have there. I would say it is a -- the productivity enhancements that we were talking about are -- through our sourcing organization as well as looking at running our factories more efficiently and I think -- our operations team has done a great job of driving that. Obviously, we started that last year and we are seeing one of full year benefit. We are starting to see the full annualized effect of that this year. And it felt really good about that. I would say it was a fairly meaningful component of the gross margin expansion, obviously, with our U.S. business driving significant growth that also had a big impact as well. And as we are thinking about the -- way that the U.S. business grew with the higher margin products in our surgical businesses, so that actually helped us -- overall as well. So it was a nice balance between the kind of the three of those things. But I think we are in the early innings of sustained kind of improvement on the gross margin basis. Bob McMahon : Hey, Bill. I would add to that. You heard me say certainly a year ago, I didn't think as a company, we would probably see much gross margin expansion. And if I say things that have changed over the last year in my own outlook that's one that -- I think we are seeing much better opportunity than I ever imagine possible. So it's back to that -- it's always puts and takes. That's one of the really good guys coming our way. Bill Quirk : Good to hear. Second, I guess just kind of a bigger picture question on blood screening and blood utilization in general. I mean, certainly, we have had the trend of the lower hemoglobin transfusion triggers in the U.S. for a while. You alluded to that we may be starting to see this internationally as well. So I guess similar question here, guys, kind of how much through the process are we, both in the U.S. and OUS? I would just be curious what your partner, Grifols, has been telling you on that. Steve MacMillan : I think we see -- in the U.S. I think we see continued low single digit declines probably in the blood screening business. Internationally probably more flattish as more countries adopt our nat testing but some more advanced ones start to cut back a little bit. So I think we see the international business more flattish. Having said that we got a couple of quarters right now that were absorbing the inventory fluctuations particularly from the year ago with the JRC where frankly we were both doing consumption plus inventory build. And now as the inventory is contracting back, we just got a couple of rougher comps that we are getting through. The underlying business slightly down but still a very good business for us but certainly it's not going to be accretive to our top-line growth rate over time. They would be dilutive to that. Operator : And we will go next to Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners. Richard Newitter : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Steve MacMillan : Hi, Rich. Richard Newitter : I was hoping just to start off on the investments that you guys are making and one of the more frequent questions we get are about your pipeline and when we will get greater visibility into what you guys have in store as you eventually come out on the other side of the tomo ramp. So first, just can you give us any sense as to whether organic or external -- where the priority is? You alluded to some of that, Steve, earlier. And then, two, any color on when we will learn about the pipeline in greater detail and what can you give us today? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Sure. Sure, Rich. Clearly, the primary focus has been on rebuilding the organic growth pipeline and I think the simplest way to think about that is probably also why we are not further along on the business development front. We feel pretty good what we are putting in place. The other piece that I start to give you a little bit of a tidbit is, a lot of what we are working on or what I call singles and doubles. And the company was built historically on every eight years we launch a mega product like 2D and then 3D Tomo. And a lot of what we are looking at is how do we cushion the blow in between and looking at some smaller things that we can be doing to bring in between those big cycles. And the diagnostics business, it's about building out menu and in the breast health business it's not just what's the replacement for 3D tomo, it says there is a lot of other stuff that we can bring out in IBS and other stuff along the way. So I think what you will start to see and as you know with me stylistically, I like to get a few points on the board before we start talking about them. And given an organization we inherited that had a few launches on the table that we had to scrap when I got here because they weren't really ready for primetime. I want to make sure, we really have our ducks in a row before we, a) start talking a lot more but I would tell you we are -- we feel better and better but it's going to be more singles and doubles than probably triples and home runs. So we will continue to update it as we go but that may give you a little more flavor from what you had historically. Richard Newitter : That's helpful, Steve. Thanks. And then just maybe one more on the surgical business. Steve MacMillan : Hey. Richard Newitter : Yes. There you go. Nice growth acceleration there and I am just trying to get a sense for how sustainable this is. Should we be thinking of this business on a kind of a newer double-digit trajectory going forward and then do you have the portfolio you need to achieve that? Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Yes. Thanks Rich. I wouldn't go there yet to the sustainable double-digit. Having said that, they posted several quarters in a row. The 18.8% clearly shocked us. We quietly put a new leader in that business late last summer. And we don't talk about all the changes we make. But that business is actually just in the last six months, we have a new VP of Marketing, a new President and new Head of Business Development, a new Head of R&D. And are more bullish and excited the team that Eric has put in place there is really, really good. And they are doing that with just two products today. We stopped the declines on NovaSure. You know it better than most that hey, just two years ago, NovaSure was a high-single digit decliner. We stopped that one and actually turned it into a positive. And the -- and MyoSure, I know when I first came here, it was growing 20% people figured we are about maxed out, last year went to 30% and we just had a 46% growth quarter. And that's even when the people asked just the market size a year or two ago and I couldn't quite answer it. And I think we are seeing -- there maybe more potential there. And then, it's a great sales team that clearly could take on another product. So I think that's an area where we are very willing and stepping up our activities and looking at bolt-on acquisitions. It's an area we're in the nascent stages frankly we're starting to expand internationally. And it's a business, it can do a lot for the profit margin and profitability profile of the company. So it's one -- we are more and more excited about. I just still model single-digit growth. But like everything we are -- we're certainly aspiring to continue the great trend. But, clearly, we did mention there was a competitive recall we think helped us in that last quarter. And so that we certainly don't see the 18.8% growth as sustainable. Aspirational, yes. And we will take it back to the division head and set that as a new goal. But pragmatically speaking we are not that good yet. Bob McMahon : And Rich, I guess the only thing I would add to that on surgical is, is the quarter that we are in now which is our second fiscal quarter does tend to be seasonally weakest quarter for us. And typically the first quarter of our fiscal year is the strongest one. Steve MacMillan : Yes. This quarter is typically a 7% to 10% decline just because of the reset of insurance plans and all that stuff from a sequential basis. Operator : And we will go next to Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Brian Weinstein : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Steve MacMillan : Hi, Brian. Brian Weinstein : How are you doing? Just wanted to ask a little bit about breast imaging again. You commented last quarter that quarters in-house had never been higher. I'm curious kind of what your backlog looks like right now and if you have seen any impact at all in terms of time to close from any discussion around the task force or any of these insurance companies that have been kind of reiterating non-payment for tomo. Is there anything in the field that you are picking up on that? Bob McMahon : Hey, Brian. This is Bob. What I would say is our -- our backlog continue to be very robust. And we have not seen any extension or time to close or anything like that. I think that's a lot of noise that people may fear about kind of in the press but when it actually comes to -- actually making purchase decisions and so forth that hasn't affected us one bit. Brian Weinstein : Great. And then if I -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. Steve MacMillan : Go ahead. Brian Weinstein : I was going to say, on cytology, you continue to reference share gains. Can you kind of talk about what inning you are in on those share gains, where you think you are in terms of market share at this point? Steve MacMillan : Sure. We are not quite sure on market share but we feel very good. We are obviously a very strong leading thing probably in the three quarters of the market share range. So up in that 70-plus percent, certainly in the U.S., we think we're much lower outside and I think part of where we are really encouraged and where I think we have made great progress internationally over the last year, year-and-a-half, is starting to get the belief and the conviction of what we need to do to grow the cytology business outside. You remember we said, one of the first things we can do to return this company to growth would stop the sharp declines on the ThinPrep business. And I think we feel pretty good about what we are doing there actually feel great. Operator : And we go next to Raj Denhoy of Jefferies. Steve MacMillan : Hi, Raj. Raj Denhoy : Good afternoon. Hey, how are you doing Steve? Steve MacMillan : Good Raj. Raj Denhoy : Wondered if I could ask -- maybe start with Panther. You have given this metric now of $170,000 per machine. Is there any updates you can give us in terms of timing on when you can get the menu expanded and when you expect viral load in the United States and then subsequent tests beyond that? Steve MacMillan : We are just rolling out viral load outside the U.S., we got the CE Marking and so we are rolling that out off of and I think that will help our molecular business. We are obviously coming off of a pretty weak base candidly internationally. It's nothing like what we have here. And really it's going to be a fiscal 2018/2019 event in terms of the true viral load impact for us in the U.S. We'll get HIV approved sooner but frankly we ultimately want to have the full range of HIV, HBV, HCV, which we won't have really until later on in 2018. So the way we think about that is, it's probably going to end up hitting at a beautiful time for us as some of the mammography business maybe slowing a bit in the U.S. and that one kicks in and provides another leg up for us. Raj Denhoy : Okay. That is helpful. And maybe just another question, too, on R&D spending was actually down this quarter relative to last year. And although you did make a comment that you expected to step up pretty dramatically, as you move through the back half of the year, is there anything you can give us in terms of what dramatically stepping up means and why it has been somewhat low up to this point? Bob McMahon : Hey, Raj, this is Bob, simply timing when we look at the clinical programs that we are having. We expect to ramp up in Q2. So don't read anything into that other than just timing. Operator : And we will go next to Jon Block of Stifel. Jon Block : Great. Thanks guys. Good afternoon. Maybe just the first one, Bob, for you. Constant currency growth was left unchanged for 2016, but how do we think about the changes to the components of the guidance that you broke out last quarter? Again, GYN was so big. International breast health was maybe a little shy. Should we just flow that through the best we can or any official changes, again, to the components of the top-line? Bob McMahon : No, specifics, I mean. I think you would flow those in obviously we were pleasantly surprised to the upside on the surgical business and then the U.S. I think our U.S. business is doing a little better than what we anticipated in our international business a little more choppy and so forth. So outside of that we are not going to give specific guidance to the individual components other than to say that any softness that we maybe seeing in the near term or the short-term internationally is going to be offset, we expect by the strength in the U.S. business. Jon Block : Okay. Got it. And then, Steve, my apologies if I missed this on some of your call there, but we have seen the international breast health business bounce around a good about before, but when you talk about what is currently going on and we have the headline risk of international and what we deal with every day from where we sit, can you just give a little bit more detail? In other words, is it the way that you are working with dealers, the relationships that you think you guys can strengthen in the coming quarters, or has there been any change to, call it, end-user demand out in the field in certain countries? Thanks, guys. Steve MacMillan : Sure, Jon. I think this is more an internal execution issue of us dealing with our dealers versus the market per se. Having said that we were hopeful to get some bigger orders in some of the emerging markets this year and we will probably just backing off that we are making some progress in Brazil and places like that. We are probably being a little more cautious about as we go in but it's much more our own execution. And frankly, again, it's a small part of our business that we know as great potential. And we will realize it. But it's more than I think than anything external or macro that we would really point to. It could be macro but we are not going to look to say it's that. I think the opportunity is still there. Operator : And we will go next to Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So maybe one on -- Steve MacMillan : Hi, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Hey, Steve. One on breast imaging and I'm sorry to sort of pick on this, but the dealer issues that you are having in international sort of what gives us the confidence or visibility that this is a short-term issue? And it looks like the U.S. growth slowed down sequentially. So I'm just wondering if you can give us some color on what happened U.S. versus OUS. Steve MacMillan : Yes. Two pieces. I think first off the U.S., we continued to feel really, really good. I mean, obviously, the growth rate Vijay what you pointed out will be slowing down as we were going against some monster comps especially when we come into the second half of this year, but really already from here on. We are now going in against much tougher comps from here guys. We are still growing the business but we are not going to be putting 20% growth rates up on top off strong growth rates from year ago. The outside of the U.S., I look at this folks, it just like every other issue we faced since we came to the company. We are not the perfectly well-oiled machine. I think we are making a little bit of progress, having made the progress that I would like to see. And it's just a matter of better execution which is something we know how to do. And it just requires a little greater focus than probably what I was providing. Vijay Kumar : Great. And then, one follow-up on diagnostics. I mean clearly, this was a monster diagnostic quarter. And it is U.S. business, you grew high singles. It feels like you are clearly gaining share. Can you provide some color on what is going on and how sustainable is the share gain, right? Because when you look at sort of the Aptima franchise, I mean those are some pretty big product lines and pretty mature. So I am just wondering why this business is so strong and what is going on. Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Yes. Vijay, I think it's been the hidden piece and back to a focus on execution where we've clearly been a little more focused in the U.S. But our team has been continuing to place Panthers, continuing to speak to the benefits that our products bring and obviously, you know us well enough to know we are not one of these out there trumpeting, gee, we are number one. We beat this person. We got this competitive win. But quietly we are really proud of what we've done on the HPV franchise in the U.S. and combined with cytology, combined with the co-testing message, combined with Panther placements. They are all -- no one thing is magic. But when you systematically pile them up it provides a very nice outlook and has us feel pretty good, this is -- this strength is going to continue. Operator : And we will go next to Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Derik de Bruin : Hi, good afternoon. Steve MacMillan : Hi, Derik. Derik de Bruin : A lot of the questions have been asked, but let me just do a couple here. So can you talk a little bit about the contribution to services for the breast health business? I know it is going to be more of an impact on the business going forward as some of those systems sort of that you placed earlier now start -- people have to start paying for service contracts. Can we think about instrument placements versus services and how it goes in the mix? Steve MacMillan : Yes. I think we feel pretty obviously the service revenue in the quarter was not as strong as the overall product revenue. But that will be a great kicker as basically every system for the most part in the second year is when those will kick in. And we will say this. We are seeing a higher attach rate on the 3D service revenue contracts than we did on 2D. So a) it's a little bit higher. So I think it's sort of one of those pieces that will kick in and we feel very good about for the future. And the team is doing a better job of actually selling service contracts today probably in a tougher environment than we ever have. Bob McMahon : Yes. Just one other thing Derik just to kind of give you a little more color on that. While on total service when we looked at it for the total company only grew roughly kind of 2%, when you actually peel the onion back and look at the biggest component of that, which is our domestic U.S. mammography business that grew in the mid single digits which is consistent with what we have been talking about as that business with that high attach rate, higher ASP relative to the service contracts on the lower ASP 2D. So we continue to feel good about that business. Derik de Bruin : Just a little clarification for me on this. So why was the 2D attachment rate on services so low historically? Steve MacMillan : Well, it wasn't -- well -- it was extremely high and we are going from an extremely high level to actually any -- even extremely higher level. It was well into the 80% and we are doing even better than -- Bob McMahon : Yes, 85-plus percent. Steve MacMillan : Yes. Operator : And we will go next to Mark Massaro of Canaccord Genuity. Mark Massaro : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the good quarter. Steve MacMillan : Thanks Mark. Mark Massaro : I wanted to ask, you acknowledge that you have seen some bundling from some of the competition in breast health and meanwhile you've also stated that you gained share. I was wondering if you could just talk about the dynamics internationally. Is the bundling occurring more frequently internationally than it is in the U.S., and can you just help us understand some of the pressures you saw internationally in context of gaining market share? Steve MacMillan : Sure. I think it's less bundling internationally than it still the stage of development internationally. We've not done nearly as good a job of selling the benefits of 3D. Just on government affair standpoint from a marketing standpoint, a lot of what we've going in the U.S., we were doing a great job of internationally because where through dealers. We have not worked with them closely enough to really segment the market. We started it, obviously, there is a lot of opportunities for 2D. We need to do that but we had so much focus on 3D and I don't think we've just done as good job of fully marketing it through. So that's a part of the whole issue of consolidating the international business under Eric. We kind of I set it up, when I first got here to have Eric really focus on the U.S., Claus focus internationally. It probably led to two silos more than sharing the learning across the geographies and frankly I feel like it's done a great job overall. But, it -- we probably left a little bit on the table related to our international development. So now, Eric is on the case and here we go. Mark Massaro : Maybe a little outside the box here, but would you consider identifying countries in Europe where you could go direct in the breast health side in particular? Steve MacMillan : Yes. We are looking at it everywhere as to what's really the best model. And that will be something I think you can expect us to report back on over time. I would tell you there is a lot more complexity to it all in that candidly in a number of geographies, we had given the marketing authorizations to the dealers. So the dealers actually own the marketing authorizations, which is not something you would typically expect of a company this size. But a) it's one of these, you go into the onion and peel it back a little more, more work to be done, which is why, we just think it's going to take us a little bit longer. I kind of viewed it as, it would be a great thing to have in the out years when things slow down in the U.S., we probably aren't getting there as fast as I would like to but we will probably end up getting there at a time that would be ultimately actually pretty well timed for the total company. Operator : And we only have time for one more question. And we will take our final question from Jason Bedford of Raymond James. Jason Bedford : Thanks for squeezing me in. I will ask two questions that require one word answers, so we can keep it within an hour here. Steve MacMillan : Right Jason. Jason Bedford : So what was the installed base of Genius at the end of the quarter? And then, what are the -- what's your latest thoughts on gross margin expectations for 2016? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Higher and higher. Yes. We're not getting -- Jason Bedford : Any better words than that, Steve? Steve MacMillan : You asked for one word answer Jason. As a reminder, we're only going to give the placement numbers on an annual basis rather than getting into quarterly pieces but we were very pleased with the additional placements of certainly the Genius systems, frankly, Panthers as well looking into our diagnostics business. And then, gross margin I think, we are basically guiding to, we think there was a 100 basis points of improvement year-over-year. And feeling very encouraged by that opportunity. Jason Bedford : Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Great. Thank you, Jason. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's first quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. Have a good evening.",

My name is [Rene] and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Mike Watts : Thank you, Rene. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks; then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website, we also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of the call will be archived on our website through May 27. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known as well as unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation from GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Steve MacMillan : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. We are very pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. We posted very good results overall, highlighted by 14.6% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. The strength of our business model was evident on three levels in the quarter. First, our U.S. businesses grew revenue at a low double digit rate continuing a recent pattern of outstanding commercial execution. Second, we again improved both gross and operating margins while making significant investments in our future and third we entered a new phase of our capital allocation strategy by repurchasing our common stock while continuing to pay down our convertible notes. Together, these strategic actions drove EPS growth more than double the rate of sales. More specifically, domestic revenue increased 10.6% in the quarter, led by strong performances by our breast health and surgical businesses. International sales were lower mainly due to expected declines in blood screening and the discontinued products we discussed in our initial guidance. But international breast health showed signs of stabilization which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. Globally, total revenues grew 5.8% on a reported basis or 6.3% in constant currency terms and if we would exclude the headwind from discontinued products second quarter revenue would have increased more than 7% in constant currency. Non-GAAP gross margin was 65.8% in the quarter, a significant improvement of 240 basis points compared to the prior year period. We reinvested much of this incremental profitability for future growth and will continue to do so in the future. But still increased non-GAAP operating margin to 33.9% in the quarter, 40 basis points higher than last year. At the same time our strong cash flows enabled us to be opportunistic in buying back our common as well as our convertible debt to continue improving our capital structure into enhanced future earnings power. Bob will cover the details in a moment, but net income represented a very robust 19.6% of sales and grew 14.1% while non-GAAP EPS totaled $0.47 up 14.6% compared to the prior year. With that introduction and overview out of the way, I\u2019d like to cover five subjects in my comments today. The first two have been topical over the last quarter, our domestic and international breast health businesses and obviously these franchisees will continue to be important to our future as well. But as we write new chapters in the Hologic story, but this course is broadening as we build on our successes and add new strategic tools. With that in mind, today I\u2019d like to highlight our surgical business, gross margin improvement opportunities and the research and development pipeline. Hopefully this discussion will provide a little incremental color into the multiple levers we can pull to generate sustainable revenue and earnings growth overtime. Let\u2019s start with our domestic breast health business which grew a very solid 11.2% based on continued adoption of our Genius 3D mammography. Genius placements were strong, increasing both sequentially and year-over-year and we saw a good increase in service revenue as well. We continue to gain market share and our investments in customer marketing are enabling us to do that while maintaining stable price amidst fierce competition. As a result, domestic imaging sales grew at a healthy mid teens rate. We believe we still have runway ahead of us as our 3D Systems are only about a third penetrated into our own installed base, and roughly 20% into the market as a whole. We remain confident in the long term opportunity as customer interest and orders inhouse remain high and as clinical evidence continues to mount on the benefits of Hologics exams for patients and physicians, specifically a longitudinal study published in February in the peer-reviewed JAMA Oncology showed that the benefits of our Genius exams [Indiscernible] and improved cancer detection can be sustained and even improved overtime with consecutive years. In addition, a separate study published just yesterday in JAMA showed that these benefits hold true for women with both Dense and Nondense Breasts. Further bolstering the case for widespread adoption. Now let\u2019s turn to our international breast health business which generated a lot of attention last quarter. While we still have a significant amount of work to do here, we did signs of stabilization in the second quarter and are optimistic that we will see further signs of progress and predictability in the quarters ahead. While revenue declined by low single digits on a constant currency basis in the second quarter, it\u2019s important to note that last year\u2019s results benefitted from sales of products that he had since discontinued. If we back out this headwind international breast health sales would have increased at a mid single digit rate in constant currency, a materially better performance than a decline we saw last quarter. As always, business improvement starts with people and our Chief Operating Officer, Eric Compton has made several important organizational changes internationally in recent months. We moved one of our key U.S. breast health leaders to Europe and he is now in charge of building stronger, mutually productive relationships with our dealer network. Towards that end we had signed several new, performance based contracts with our top dealers. In addition, we have hired a new European Head of Service, which we have identified as a critical role to support our dealers and direct customers. We also have brought our new leaders of marketing, molecular diagnostics, surgical and regulatory, so the team is coming together nicely. Now let me turn to those three new topics surgical, gross margins and R&D. Lets cover surgical first. Global sales were $90.9 million in the quarter and grew 15.9% in constant currency. Surgical has exemplified the tremendous commercial turnaround that has occurred at Hologic with the second quarter representing the fifth consecutive quarter of double digit growth in the United States. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that Surgical was viewed as a non-strategic asset that should be divested. Today, however, surgical is a vibrant business with strong profitability and cash flow plus good growth potential and I couldn\u2019t be proud of the team who has made it happen. Their formula for success has been straightforward. Stabilization of our NovaSure franchise which was declining at a high single digit rate only a couple of years ago, combined with excellent growth from our MyoSure products for [Uterine] and fibroid removal. We remain enthusiastic about the potential for MyoSure as we seek to expand the addressable market and replace older treatments. And now with the market withdrawal of our competitor to NovaSure we have an opportunity to drive material growth for that product as well. We believe that NovaSure sales benefitted from the competitive recall by a few million dollars in the quarter and we are investing in marketing and physician outreach programs to ensure this continues for the balance of the year. The second topic I want to cover is our ability to improve gross margins. A year ago, we weren\u2019t overly bullish in this regard, but our operations team deserves a tremendous amount of credit for improving upon already strong profitability. To highlight what we\u2019ve been able to achieve in the second quarter, non-GAAP cost of goods sold for our products was lower, in absolute terms than it was in the prior year period, despite an increase in sales. This is far bigger than a mix shift story. It is reflecting tremendous work by our teams. To make this possible, new leadership is instituted productivity improvement targets for each of our plants and local managers have responded with scores of specific projects. We are closing our Bedford facility, our former corporate headquarters and moving the skeletal manufacturing that was done there to a contract manufacturer. And as we have discussed previously we are doing a much better job of leveraging our corporate purchasing power across the business. The third area I want to discuss is our research and development pipeline and it\u2019s important to begin with a bit of context. The unfortunate truth is that our R&D pipeline was weak, reflecting years of a growth by acquisition mindset. Too often R&D spending was viewed as a plug in the income statement. The amount that was left over while attempting to meet short term financial goals. To reverse this mentality we have been adding talent and rebuilding processes across the company to make R&D a driver of sustainable growth again. Although this process is far from complete, we are beginning to see the fruits of our labor. In diagnostics for example, we now have a robust menu of molecular assays available on Panther in Europe spanning women\u2019s health as well as virology. Recently we have secured CE-marks for new tests for HIV-1, Hepatitis-C, Hepatitis-B and a sexually transmitted disease called Mycoplasma genitalium. In the United States we are already the leader in women\u2019s health. We have filed the pre market approval application for our HIV viral load asset. And the PMA for our hepatitis C Assay is scheduled to be submitted late this calendar year. Finally, our Panther fusion platform which will provide customers the flexibility to perform PCR testing in a single unit dose format is on track to be introduced internationally next year. In surgical we are now in the process of launching a line extension called MyoSure, Reach. MyoSure, Reach increases clinical utility by providing surgeons the access to polyps and fibroids in more areas of the uterus. And we believe that will play an important role in extending our leadership position in the field. Finally in breast health we are excited about two new biopsy products that will further build on our positions as the innovative leader in the market. Our new 3D enabled Affirm prone biopsy system was introduced in Europe in March and is being launched domestically now. Affirm represents the first real innovation in the biopsy space in roughly 20 years and leverages our growing installed base of Genius systems by enabling physicians to perform a more accurate biopsy using 3D technology. To further enhance our biopsy business, we expect to launch an entirely new biopsy tool in Brevera next year. Brevera has break through potential as it allows real time analysis of the biopsy sample, thereby vastly improving the patient experience. Stay tuned for more information on this. Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me conclude by saying that we are pleased with our second quarter financial results which in some ways opened a new chapter in the Hologic story. As in recent quarters, our commercial teams generated robust growth in the United States. At the same time, we generated operating leverage through productivity improvements while simultaneously investing for the future. And we boosted our bottom line performance by opportunistically deploying capital. All-in-all a solid well rounded performance. Now I will hand the call over to Bob. Bob McMahon : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I am going to highlight our other divisional sales drivers and some key financial metrics and then wrap up with our updated financial guidance for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. Overall, we had a strong second quarter, with double digit growth in the U.S. in addition three of our four businesses demonstrated global growth in the quarter. Steve already discussed breast health and surgical, so I will focus on diagnostics and skeletal. Diagnostics our largest business reported sales of $304.4 million in the second quarter, growing 3.2% in constant currency terms. We are pleased to report another positive quarter in our cytology and perinatal business which generated $116.1 million in sales growing 3.5% in constant currency. U.S. sales grew mid single digits which was by far our highest growth in several years, even with lingering headwinds from path interval expansions. Turning to molecular diagnostics we posted sales of $126.1 million up 5.8% in constant currency. Domestic sales increased at a faster rate as our fully automated Panther system continues to accumulate new placements and competitive wins. In addition, utilization in sales of our assays for Trichomonas, HPV chlamydia, gonorrhoea continue to grow. Internationally, we had another solid quarter of Panther placements. This keeps us optimistic about our future growth potential in Europe, where we now have a full menu of women\u2019s health and viral load assays as Steve mentioned. In blood screening, worldwide revenue of $62.2 million decreased 2.4% in constant currency as expected. While there were some geography shifts as our partner Grifols balanced inventory, the overall decline was mainly due to stronger ordering in the prior year period to support the rollout of our business with the Japanese Red Cross. We do continue to see however trends towards lower blood utilization worldwide and therefore anticipate that quarterly blood screening sales will settle in the mid $50 million range as the market and customer usage patterns mature. In skeletal health, we had $22.2 million in global sales, a decline of 8.2% in constant currency. Domestically, sales increased at a low single digit rate, but international sales were negatively affected by distributor ordering patterns. Because this business is so small, it is not uncommon to see these kinds of fluctuations and we do expect that skeletal will be a solid contributor to growth overtime. Now let me switch gears and discuss operating expenses in the second quarter. Total expenses of $221.2 million increased 12.9% mainly as a result of our continued investment in breast health and diagnostic marketing programs along with the timing of R&D program which we foreshadowed last quarter. This increase in spending which will continue into the second half of the year is planned and deliberate, and the key component of our strategy to generate long term sustainable growth. Two factors contribute to our willingness to support these incremental investments, first and most importantly we see good returns on the specific projects we are pursuing. For example, our investments in consumer marketing for Genius are enabling us to gain market share while maintaining stable price in the face of new competition. Second, we already have an industry leading operating margin and have shown that we can and will increase this margin overtime, but our goal is not to drive operating margin to unprecedented levels for our industry, instead we want to steadily improve them while also investing in appropriately in DCF positive projects for long term growth. At the same time, our goal is to allocate capital to enhance shareholder returns and during the second quarter, we accelerated our efforts in this regard. For the last few years our primary use of excess cash has been to pay down debt and our long standing goal of reduction net debt to 2.5 times EBITDA by the end of 2017 remains in effect. As evidence of this, we spent $311.4 million in the second quarter to repurchase convertible notes with the principle value of $226.6 million. While our convertible debt totaled over $1.3 billion in principal less than 12 months ago, it is now down to $793.3 million a reduction of more than $0.5 billion. And given the continuing strength of our cash flows we are in a position to supplement debt reduction with opportunistic repurchases of our common stock. Specifically in the second quarter, we brought back 4.3 million shares of our stock for $148.8 million. While stock buy backs have always been part of our long term plan, market weakness in the second quarter enabled us to pounce a little earlier than expected. These strategic actions enabled us to sequentially reduce our share count in the second quarter, the first time in a long while that our diluted share count declined. In fact, diluted shares outstanding or 288 million were basically flat compared to the prior year period no longer diluting EPS growth, specially non-GAAP EPS increased 14.6% about 2.5 times the rate of sales. Let me just emphasize that our debt reduction and buy back activities will not prohibit us from seeking other opportunities for tuck in acquisitions. Our business development teams are settling in and while no transactions are eminent, we are actively evaluating opportunities across our businesses. Before I move on to guidance, let me cover a few other financial metrics from the second quarter. Improvements made to our balance sheet contributed to a total debt outstanding of $3.4 billion a decrease of 534.1 million compared to a year ago and net debt of 3.1 billion. Our leverage ratio net debt over EBITDA now stands at 3.1 times. In the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $253.8 million up 6.4% compared to the prior year period. In addition, our trailing 12-month EBTIDA surpassed $1 billion this quarter, a nice milestone for the company. Our ability to generate strong profits while lowering debt has again allowed us to increase return on invested capital. As our second fiscal quarter, ROIC was 11.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, a 170 basis point improvement over the prior year. Finally let\u2019s turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and third quarter. Starting with the full year, we are raising the low end of our revenue guidance by $10 million to reflect the solid performance in the first half of the year. We now expect reported revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.83 billion in fiscal 2016 representing reported growth of 3.9% to 4.6%. Based on recent exchange rates, this equates to constant currency growth of between 4.6% and 5.4%. Compared to our last guidance, there are a few puts and takes related to revenue. On the positive side, the market withdrawal of a competing surgical product should provide a tailwind to NovaSure and the dollar has weakened slightly. The currency benefit for us is less than you might expect however since much of the dollar weakening has been relative to Japanese Yen and other currencies where we have minimal exposure. In terms of headwinds we are more cautious on near term blood screening revenue given macro trends in the market and we do risk our international forecast slight I should also mention we have made the voluntary decision to stop selling CF InPlex our test for cystic fibrosis due to manufacturing quality issues at a key component supplier that recently resulted in a recall. This will represent a headwind of several million dollars to our U.S. molecular diagnostics revenue in the second half of the year but shouldn\u2019t have much effect on margins. In terms of earnings for the full year we now expect EPS of between $1.89 and $1.91 which translates to reported growth between 13.2% and 14.4% or constant currency growth of 14.6% to 15.8% this is based on the effective tax rate of approximately 33% and diluted shares outstanding of roughly $292 million for the full year. As we work through your models you will see that our increased EPS guidance implies a healthy expansion of already industry leading operating margins while accommodating increased investment, specifically we intend to continue investing behind our Genius campaign in breast health and cervical cancer co-testing and diagnostics. We will aggressively fund the commercial activities to launch important new products such as our Affirm prone biopsy system and capitalize on the competitive investment environment surrounding NovaSure. We also expect to make some key hirers in our international business which typically comes in with initial sign in cost for relocation and the like. And we are pursuing some entirely new R&D initiatives such as developing a blood screening test for the Zika virus while also seeking out opportunities to accelerate R&D timelines for existing initiatives for example by increasing the breadth of outside support. Not all of these investments are permanent in nature, but we do expect them to push operating expenses upward in the second half of the year. At the same time however, our capital deployment activities are effectively offsetting the impact of the strategic investments on the bottom line. Now turning to guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues of $695 million to $705 million. Compared to the prior year period, this range reflects a reported growth of 0.2% to 1.6% or 0.6% to 2% on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, these lower growth rates are due to a much tougher comparable in the prior year period when revenue jumped almost $40 million on a sequential basis. In terms of the bottom line, we forecast diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47 to $0.48 in the third quarter. This represent continued strong growth of 9.3% to 11.6% on a reported basis was 10.1 to 12.4 in constant currency terms. Our full year guidance obviously implies the sequential step up in the fourth quarter revenue. This is due to normal sequential business momentum that we expect contributions from new product launches and the timing of some royalty revenue that is expected later this year. Before opening up the call for questions, I would like to reiterate that our view on the second quarter is one of a good multi level execution. Revenue grew at a solid rate based on continued outperformance domestically and stabilization outside the United States. We improved already strong operating margins while accommodating increased investment in key growth drivers. In our capital deployment activities helped to pay for these investments at the EPS line while setting the stage for leveraged growth over the long term. Now that we are half way through our fiscal year we are optimistic about our full year forecast. We are anticipating solid, mid single digit revenue growth in line with our original expectations as strength in the U.S. offsets the weakness we have seen internationally. We forecast solid expansion of operating margins while simultaneously investing for the future. And we expect the acceleration of our capital redeployment activities to allow us to leverage operating gains all the way down to EPS which should grow at a mid teens rate. With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus or related follow up and return to the queue. Operator we are ready for the first question. Isaac Ro : Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Hey, Isaac. Isaac Ro : Hey, Steve. I wanted to start with the outlook in the ex-U.S. business and specifically understand kind of what's embedded in your outlook for this quarter. You obviously made some changes to the team there as you pointed out. I'm curious if you talk a little about how the changes in the team will justifies with just the operating environment and just that we understand the guidance little better? Steve MacMillan : Yes. I would say, still very conservative near term, because we started the signal about this time last year. The deeper we dug into international, international for context is really much more of a start-up than a turnaround. We've got our three franchises across the geographies and so what Eric is really doing in part of what specific data, the changes we need to really build out a team not just get a team that was in place operating differently, and so Eric is really going out. We're already recruiting and bringing in different people, different leaders, but it\u2019s going to take that \u2013 that's going to more a 2017, 2018 event, I think, and really we're thinking about international as drivers in especially frankly 2018, 2019, 2020 and not as focused on the near term. So I think the near term is pretty cautious and conservative. But it will be coming through right when we need it. Isaac Ro : Got it. That's helpful. May be second question would be on [Indiscernible], just curious if you could update us on what you've learned about the nature of the products like here in terms of the pace and magnitude of adoption. You've given us some color for last couple of quarter, but curious on update there, especially if you put in context with the [Indiscernible] study earlier this week and then just what you're seeing in terms of how effectively your customers are able to get reinvestment and all that. Just an update on how that's going. Steve MacMillan : Sure. I think if you go back two years and I described at the time we probably saw a building a freight train, clearly I think the combination of better reimbursement and especially our consumer marketing efforts and our sales efforts really dramatically accelerated that. And instead of a freight train, it definitely look for like an aeroplane I think taking off. And you saw that especially as you know in our third quarter last year when you starting really positing this 20% growth numbers. I think what we see is we still feel very good about the order trends and about frankly the biggest piece I think we're incredibly excited about is the way we're holding pricing. And the demand still looks very good, having said that we're going against obviously now as we go into this third quarter, we're going against the huge comps and therefore again as we try to signal of last year that the absolute growth rate will probably be slower here for the U.S. breast health business, as certainly as we into the coming quarters, but I think still feeling really good, that there is a lot of runway ahead and I think when we talk to investors I think people often think there's going to be a peak in that huge trough. I think we're seeing it is probably would be much more of a Plato, whereas we hit a peak, but there is still a lot of runway that should have us last for quite a while here. Bob McMahon : Hey, Isaac, this is Bob. Just a follow-up on what Steve is saying. The numbers where we expected them to be and what I would say is also in terms of the placements where we're not going to get specific number, it was up sequentially as we expected and also up versus prior year. So we feel continued good about our continued adoption in driving that business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Groberg with UBS. Steve MacMillan : Hey, John. Jonathan Groberg : Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on a solid quarter and hitting on all these important themes. I guess there is two questions from me both on the molecular diagnostics front. One, can you maybe talk about [Indiscernible] kind of what you're seeing and some of the key test there both in the U.S. and internationally, I think you specifically mentioned you'd had some pretty uptake on the menu and panther in Europe. And then two, if you just clarify Bob on the cystic fibrosis test that you're exiting, are you exiting or is it just a recaller, because of the recaller you are now exiting that business and was that a few million dollars on an annual basis, was that kind of be the headwind? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Yes. Actually it\u2019s going to be a few, we are exiting it. I'll take your second question first [gap audio] we are exiting it permanently and it will be a few million just in the second half of the year, so it would be larger than that on an annual basis. It\u2019s roughly a $10 million annual number, annual product. So we'll absorb that. And then in terms of the test, I think we feel really good about the continued uptake of both the full menu in the U.S. and starting to see some encouraging signs on the update of the menu in Europe, but again we wanted to be very careful, making sure we're not declaring victory until we start to string together a number of quarters. But I think we're starting to see some better panther placement. We have a new leader of molecular business in Europe who actually came later last year and so he starting to get his traction and driving its. So I think feeling pretty good about where that business should be going. Bob McMahon : And I think we continue feel good about gaining share here in U.S. as well and across the major assets that we have. We start breaking up and track all the things. We're seeing growth, nice growth really across each of the asset. Jonathan Groberg : Could you just maybe comment on annual consumable run rate, is it increasing in panther, where we are in terms of the annual utilization? Steve MacMillan : We spoke Jonathan, we mentioned 170,000 on a worldwide basis last quarter and its actually increased from there, this year. And the U.S. being higher than that in terms of the average sell for panther. And I think I give you the highest level how we're feeling about the diagnostics business right now. We're incredibly [Indiscernible] with what's [Indiscernible] is going, remember that was a really ugly situation just couple of years ago that business is now clearly flattens to modest growth, molecular is looking good and blood screening is probably a little bit behind, you know blood screening and that's the one we don't control the commercial channel on. We're seeing probably greater inventory reductions, certainly than what we expect in start of the year and we're absorbing it based on the strength in the parts of the business. Operator : Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Hey, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : Hey. Bob wondering if you can maybe comment on gross margins, you guys were about 150 basis points of what we've been modeling. Just wondering how much of this is function of mix versus maybe some of the operational improvements and what should we expect for our gross margins going forward? Bob McMahon : Yes. So we're not going to give a specific target on gross margin going forward, Tycho, but what I would say is, it is an element of geography mix, product mix and productivity. Actually geography mix is the smallest component of that, roughly about 25% of that improvement was due to geography. And the rest being the product and productivity and what I would say it is probably equally split between those two. And we feel good about our continued improvement there with the initiatives that Steve talked about across all of the functions of our business, our operations team are really executing well and identifying opportunities to continue to improve efficiencies and obviously as our sales growth drives more units to the factory that also helps us well. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Then question for Steve. I know you get a lot of questions on managing kind of the tomo cliff. And just wondering with the pipeline components you've laid out today plus the service business, which you guys continue to highlight do you feel like you've got enough of a line of sight that that's going to be kind of a smooth transition. And if not can you maybe just touch on capital deployment. I mean you talked more about buybacks today, but how do you view the opportunity set? And then do you need to rely on tuck-ins to effectively manage the tomo cliff when that comes? Steve MacMillan : Sure, Tycho. First I'm going to try to dissuade you from using the cliff because we've been working very hard to make sure that it won't be a cliff, and I'd say that in all seriousness. We've been very focused on what happened with the 2D curve and everything else and by thinking about how we extend out and do some line extensions and other things that's been a huge part of our focus to be able to have more of a plateau or very soft decline in that segment of the business at some point in time as suppose to real cliff. I think it\u2019s part of what we have coming things in biopsy and frankly people [entities] running that business for us. It\u2019s a longer track record being about to put even some singles and double on the board in addition to just the every home or every five or eight year home run that we've tended to have in this business. So I would tell you I'm feeling incrementally better every time Bob and I and Eric Compton are down meeting with that business on what's happening in their pipeline and we'll talk more and more about that certainly in the coming quarters and years. But I think we're feeling better about being able to mitigate that. To the other piece, I just want to jump even though your question on margin to Bob, because I was very adamant early on when I came was probably not expecting much margin expansion. This has been one of the very positive surprises to me. And I think the big piece that I want to be clear on is, we're going to use a lot of this gross margin expansion to continue to invest into the business which leads to the second part of your follow-up question there, which is as we go forth we are certainly spending more on R&D, more in marketing and it will allow to do tuck-in acquisitions based on the cash generation. And so I think we're really opening up a new leg in the store, where we got more levers available to us than we did two years ago. Two years ago we were so hamstrung with the debt and the converts and everything else. We didn't have really an ability to potentially manage, because as we all know we're going to see some ups and downs in the rate of sales growth. We're going to continue to grow. We're going to have some periods that will be a little bit slower while we wait for the next new products to come through. I think we're feeling better and better that we're going to be able to deliver very strong earnings growth consistently and in the periods when we are growing faster we\u2019ll probably reinvest a little bit more in the periods that are slower, we may not have quite the accelerated investments in that type. So hopefully that starts to give a little more of a longer term view of what we are thinking about. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays Jack Meehan : Hi, thanks good afternoon. I just wanted to ask kind of little bit more granularity on the blood screening business and what you are seeing the market today and I think I caught a mid $50 million number you referenced. Just, what is the trajectory of that business look like over the next maybe three to six quarters? Steve MacMillan : I think it\u2019s going to be slightly down. I think if we look Jack at the global market, let\u2019s take it by U.S. The U.S. clearly hospitals are getting better and better at managing their inventory at minimally invasive surgery at being able to limit their use of blood. So I think we are forecasting that the U.S. is a slight decliner. This quarter, our U.S. business was actually up fairly significantly in blood that was more an inventory correction, but I think the way we are thinking about it is this is a low single digit decliner. Internationally, I think we see the business very slight grower, but globally I think because of the declines in the U.S. we think about blood screening as a flattish to slightly down business. And that\u2019s -- you go back to the headwinds we had as a company facing us a years ago it was blood, it was NovaSure, it is MyoSure. I\u2019m sorry; it was blood, NovaSure and ThinPrep. The two that we control the commercial channel feel great about changing the long term trajectory. I don\u2019t think we are quite as ready to declare a change in the trajectory of blood screening. Then I think the other thing that\u2019s important to note Jack there is this is a macro trend, we are not [losing gap] contracts, we have not lost any contracts. We are the market leader so as the market goes, so goes our business and I think that\u2019s important to say that we continue to feel good about continuing to secure the contracts that we have and this is more a utilization factor as opposed to loosing contracts to competitors. Jack Meehan : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one on Panther, the incremental Panthers that you are placing in the field now, I\u2019m just curious what\u2019s the mix of the customers look like, is it existing customers adding capacity, is it new customers, how much of a driver has been year up, any additional detail will be great. Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Yes it\u2019s a bit of both in terms of existing and newer and to some degree it\u2019s starting to go [Indiscernible] slightly smaller accounts. We\u2019ve penetrated most of the large ones and part of this is we look at our menu of the future and what we have coming we realize if we can get a few more Panthers placed even in midsize accounts, hospital labs other reference labs that\u2019s going to benefit us as well. And frankly, Panther has got a pretty good footprint for OUS, but we\u2019re never really put the resources behind it and so we are starting to place a few more internationally especially in Europe right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Chris Lin : Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Chris on for Doug today. Thanks for taking the question. Bob McMahon : Sure. Chris Lin : Bob, can you help us walk through the bridge for the EPS guidance. Our math suggests that just the share count reduction relative to the prior guidance should get you about $0.03 of benefit increase EPS by $0.02 at the midpoint. And this was despite AP this quarter. I guess the question is, are you changing any other operating investment or assumptions that would impact EPS growth? Bob McMahon : So your math is very similar to our math. We calculate that the change in share count calculates about $0.03. We\u2019ve raised the midpoint $0.02 and we talked about the increased investment that we plan to make and are going to be delivered about making in both R&D and marketing in the second half of the year. And that\u2019s essentially the math that you should be able to walk through. We are expecting higher operating expenses in the second half as a result of the benefits that we are seeing in those to generate long term sustainable growth both in R&D and marketing. And so we are taking some of that benefit and reinvesting into the business. Steve MacMillan : Yes Chris to add to that is if you think about it we grew EPS about 14ish percent last year at the high end of the range this year it\u2019s going to be another 14 on top of 14. There\u2019s a point at which you don\u2019t want to go too far because we are thinking about this over the long haul. Chris Lin : Great. That's helpful. And hopefully I'm right on this but can you talk about the OUS cytology perinatal growth. It appears OUS growth for that business slowed on a sequential basis. Is this right, and what was the cause of this? Steve MacMillan : Hey you are exactly right. I think we saw a little bit of inventory correction in China, primarily and I think we probably with some distributor changes and everything else there is a little more inventory probably in the channel there than what we had fully grasped. So I think it\u2019s a underlying consumption. It looks good, and I think we may have another quarter or so with a little bit of adjustment here and then probably be as Eric has dug in deeper and deeper we are getting better granularity, better visibility and I think it\u2019s more of a an inventory contraction issue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray Bill Quirk : Great. Thanks. First question is timing around the Zika virus assay. I know you guys have one in development. I know one of your competitors has introduced it in the southern part of the country, but just kind of thinking about timing around that rollout and then I guess a second part of that question is, is the testing strategy here has been a little different than what we've seen historically, where it looks like we are doing region-by-region testing rather than the whole country. So I would love to hear your comments on those two? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Sure, Bill. On the first part, we\u2019ve been working very aggressively with both CDC and FDA on the topic and we should have a blood screening product via IND for use here in the coming months by early summer certainly by the peak mosquito, in time for mosquito season. We don\u2019t yet know exactly how the market is going to play out. We\u2019ve been through this script before with dengue and West Nile and not being quite sure clearly it does look like there is rationality to this and we are prepared with the various centers to be ready and responsive to what is needed to be done. And our primary focus initially is on blood screening. We are also and as part of the additional investment in the second half also looking on the diagnostic side of it as well that would be further out time wise. Bill Quirk : Got it. And then just a real quick follow up. The PMA that was filed on HIV viral load, I'm assuming that happened during the quarter, can you give us any incremental color there? Steve MacMillan : It will be; excuse me\u2026 Bill Quirk : And then about -- just about a 12 month turnaround time on that, guys? Steve MacMillan : Yes -- so HIV has been filed in recent months and for a PMA we typically assume about a year. Bill Quirk : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Steve MacMillan : Hey Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Hi guys. Steve MacMillan : Why don\u2019t [Indiscernible] Boston Scientific headline today by the way. Vijay Kumar : Thank you, Steve. I'll make sure I have a better one for you guys. Just maybe turning to -- this is the guidance. And when you look at the 3Q to 4Q sort of ramp, can you just explain to me, Steve or Bob your comfort on sort of the -- it just seems to be 3Q to 4Q it seems to be slightly higher than sort of the QoQ ramp? Bob McMahon : Yes hi Vijay, this is Bob. Obviously the sequential spike is greater when you are modeling at the top of the guidance range, so I would suggest that you model kind of to the midpoint. But it\u2019s driven by our confidence in sequential growth of 3D, that\u2019s a big piece of it as well as the other businesses. So the impact of our new product launch is such as the Affirm biopsy which had been built into our plan. The -- some of the growth in the NovaSure business as you recall that would be strong there and then we also have some royalty revenue that shows up in our molecular diagnostics business in the fourth quarter again which we had anticipated this year. Vijay Kumar : Great. And maybe one last big picture question for Steve on cap deployment. I saw that you guys took out the convert in the queue. I'm just curious at what point do you feel, Steve, comfortable on maybe deploying capital for M&A versus lowering the debt load? Steve MacMillan : Yes we are ready and willing to spend there on M&A and actually we did make an acquisition of our own stock in the quarter. That was actually a pretty good acquisition that we made and we are feeling pretty good about that. The teams are definitely looking and where Bob and Eric and I are now reviewing on a more regular basis ideas. We also just looked and so we will not let it get in the way. Ultimately I look forward to the day that we have no converts left on the balance sheet, but I would suspect we will be doing some acquisitions along the way while we continue to clean those up. So, still in the way at this point in time still focusing the division on what we call bite size, things that supplement the existing businesses and we are very willing and ready to go, but I would say as Bob said in his script nothing eminent wouldn\u2019t even necessarily expect any, anything much in this fiscal year necessarily. So we thought mop up some share as well that the market gave us a nice opportunity. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian Weinstein : Hey guys thanks for taking the question. Seeing, if we can get maybe a little bit more granular on Genius. If we use the airplane analogy, when do you guys think that you will level off at 35,000 feet in other words, I mean is it -- do you think you have -- through sometime through 2017. Do you think it's a longer ramp than that, anything that you can help us triangulate on, on when you hit that plateau? Steve MacMillan : Sure. It probably is 17 at some point in 17 and we have thought originally it would have been 18 or beyond I think the success and the faster climb. We are getting to 35,000 feet faster probably a good year faster than I would have imagined, but I think we\u2019ll definitely be able to stay up there for a while. Brian Weinstein : Okay, and then\u2026 Steve MacMillan : I think we are starting to think 17 is probably it. Brian Weinstein : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you and then on the repurchases, can you remind me do you have anything in your covenants that restrict the repurchase amounts that you have. And what your current authorization is for share repurchases? Thanks. Bob McMahon : Yes hey Brian this is Bob. We have currently an authorization for 250 so we roughly have about 100 million at the end of the quarter. There is nothing significant in our covenants that would prohibit anything of that size and nature. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies Investments. Raj Denhoy : Hi, good afternoon. Steve MacMillan : Hey Raj. Raj Denhoy : I wonder if I could explore this idea of you guys plateauing a bit in tomo. The guidance you gave for the third quarter as well as the fourth quarter sort of implies that that's happening, right? And when we think about 2017 though, is the growth that you've implied for the back half of the year which is something in the 2% to 3% range really what we should think about for the business until you get to this next product cycle whether it's in diagnostic or otherwise. Is that how we should think about the business over the next 12 to 18 months or so? Steve MacMillan : Sure, Ray. I think first up we are not quite plateaud yet. We are still implying some growth in the final couple of quarters but definitely much slower growth. And I do think we are preparing for 2017 it\u2019s going to be slower top line growth than where we\u2019ve been over the last four or five six quarters. I think just being pragmatic about it. And as part of the investments we are making today so that we know we can set ourselves up to continue to deliver frankly very healthy EPS growth even in what might be a slightly lower top line growth environment. Raj Denhoy : But is something in that sort of 3ish percent range the way we should think about 2017 for you guys from a revenue growth standpoint? Steve MacMillan : We are just not ready to get into pre announcing 2017 guidance at this point, but it certainly going to be lower than where it was, probably not a horrible number to use at this point in time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from [David Luis] with Morgan Stanley. Scott Wang : Hi guys it\u2019s actually Scott in for David. Steve and Bob, I think guidance for this year implies comp adjusted stability into third quarter versus second quarter, and then kind of a sharp acceleration into the fourth quarter. Can you just give us an idea of what's driving that effect? Steve MacMillan : Yes hey Scott, we -- in the fourth quarter we talked about continued growth in 3D sequentially. We also have the benefit, the continued benefit of some tailwinds around our NovaSure business with the competitive market withdrawal. And we have some royalty income that shows up in the fourth quarter as well as the new products, products like the Affirm prone biopsy cable that show up more in the fourth quarter than they do in the third quarter. Scott Wang : Understood. And just a follow up I guess on the GYN surgical part on NovaSure, can you -- I think you so mentioned in your commentary earlier that the impact from the competitive recall was about $1 million to $2 million. Can you seize the opportunity from here? And do you expect kind of pro rata share going forward or a higher share going forward? Thank you. Steve MacMillan : We will always expect a higher share. We don\u2019t have a completely great handle on exactly what that number would be going forward, but I can tell you we are just with our surgical team this week and they are having a lot of success, doing tremendous job on both NovaSure and MyoSure. It\u2019s clearly been one of the more positive upsides to the business. Again, if you look over the last two years where surgical was and where it\u2019s going we are feeling really good about the trajectory. But that is -- that is one of the areas we are making incremental operating investments in to capture that, and so that\u2019s part of the second half in investments as well as the 3D Genius campaign and they are contesting in the marketing side on the diagnostics business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Steve MacMillan : Hey Derik. Derik de Bruin : Hi, good afternoon, how are you? Steve MacMillan : All right. Derik de Bruin : So in HPV, one of your competitors mentioned they've seen some share gains in the U.S. on their primary testing assay. Can you sort of comment on that. I mean, I obviously, your gains in cytology would suggest that your co-testing isn't suffering from this. So could you just talk about -- first of all I guess certainly share gains in the cytology market. And then just on the primary testing situation. Steve MacMillan : Yes I think we are feeling pretty good about I mean ultimately the science on -- the science as well as many, probably some of the best. I think the science is very much on our side on co-testing and we feel very good about what we are seeing both on the cytology side and frankly on our HPV side. So, I don\u2019t -- we certainly don\u2019t see us loosing share on HPV. Bob McMahon : No I would say both on HPV and ThinPrep Derik in the quarter grew above market. Derik de Bruin : Great, that's helpful. And just one quick follow-up. I guess when you look at where you are in Panther placements versus the total addressable market, I mean how far would you say has Panther penetrated? Steve MacMillan : Fifth or sixth [indiscernible] Derik in the U.S. Derik de Bruin : In U.S. Great. Steve MacMillan : In our earlier inning in U.S. And then [Indiscernible] we got to build the capabilities outside the U.S. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Newitter with Leerink Partners Rich Newitter : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Steve MacMillan : Hi, Rich. Rich Newitter : Hi, how are you? Just wanted to make sure that I had the buckets right for the moving parts on your constant currency guidance, and what went up and what's kind of good and what's bad -- or incrementally good and incrementally bad. So it sounds like the blood screen reduced outlook is call it, maybe $10 million in the back half. It's a bad guy. You didn't have FX, which is a good guy. If you could quantify that on some level or quantify each of these buckets that would be great. It sounds like you have a little bit better of an outlook in GYN with a competitor off the market. So maybe incrementally better there. And then you also have the new MyoSure product, so that's the third bucket. That's a good guy. And then you said that you had a slightly weaker or more conservative OUS outlook, and I'd love to know just kind of where that factors in -- in magnitude relative to the blood screening which my math is getting to about $10 million incremental weakness. Bob McMahon : Yes Rich, we are probably not going to give all that level of detailed \u2026 Steve MacMillan : Cause no matter what we do will be wrong, but\u2026 Bob McMahon : [Indiscernible] I think your numbers are not that far off. I would say the FX is probably a little smaller than you may estimate for others, because we do have about a little over a third of our international business is actually based in U.S. dollars. The other piece is the CF recall and market withdrawal that we mentioned before which is roughly we mentioned that that\u2019s a $10 million annual business, so think about that as roughly a $5 million headwind in the back half of the year. Rich Newitter : Okay. And just the weaker OUS kind of -- or more conservative OUS outlook, is that separate from blood screening, or is that part of that? Bob McMahon : Yes, it\u2019s a little different, but it\u2019s not that -- it\u2019s small. You captured the other big pieces. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Jon Block : Great, thanks and good afternoon. Steve, maybe the first one for you, and I get all the airplane analogies but at the end of the day, we are still in a tomo product cycle that's arguably 20% penetrated for the industry. If I look back, that's were sort of film to 2D at this massive inflation, and so I get the tough comps and maybe one in the plateau than the cliff word, but can you just talk to why the 2017 growth plateau in tomo? When again, arguably, when I look back, at least at the last product cycle that's really where you saw the incremental penetration start to take off? Steve MacMillan : I think if you really look, we had such a positive inflection point in the third quarter last year, we're in that run up for right now. I think we would always rather be a little conservative on potentially preannounce the fundamental realities we're not totally sure. The dynamics are different than they were at that point in time from both competitive set as well as where hospital stand, everything else. We do think there are probably some upside in private sector insurance that will continue to kick in as it plays out. And I think it\u2019s why we still feel really good about where it\u2019s going. But I think pragmatically we are picturing it as less of this incredible spike and probably just reaching kind of a new level where its continuing to increase slightly for a while and but not the 20% growth rates that we were getting for few quarters in a row. Jon Block : Got it. Perfect. Then just one more. It\u2019s a little bit more granular, but international molecular, I know it's small, but were the revenues up year over year like the prior two quarters? And then just at a higher level, can you talk about what you are seeing with international molecular? You've got the viral load assays over there. Are you seeing that help sort of gain market share on the heels of some of those approvals? Thanks, guys. Steve MacMillan : Yes. As a backdrop remember our international molecular business is still frankly weigh too small, so it was roughly flattish in the quarter. We're seeing some growth in Europe and I think that's where we really want to see the growth and probably its taking a little more of an opportunity. Still some fluctuations in some of the other smaller markets around the world, but I think what we expect over time is we're placing \u2013 we actually have started to really place some Panthers in Europe. I think we'll see that as Europe probably being the beachhead for building out that international molecular business, that also should start to provide some steadier growth and steadier foundation to the business to build out. Fundamentally what we lacked in the company as a true foundational business for really any of our franchise that's outside the U.S. We had sales here and there from certain tenders but we haven't had the fundamental strength what you starting each quarter knowing you got a nice book of business that's automatically coming in. Even in the old days, we used to sell the Panthers instead of reagent rentals and things like that. So we are just trying to get a lot more disciplined to get a much healthier business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bedford with Raymond James. Jason Bedford : Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to follow-up on the 3D discussion, do you think the lack of widespread private payer coverage is impacting the uptake of 3D? I've noticed that you guys have become more aggressive on the marketing side there. Steve MacMillan : We don\u2019t think it\u2019s -- we feel pretty good about the uptake. And I think it\u2019s an incremental opportunity. I don\u2019t see we see it, we don\u2019t see it as a real barrier, we see it probably as additional upside. Jason Bedford : Okay. And then just to follow up on the international build out, I realized that it's a long term initiative. But when do think, Steve you will have the team in place internationally? Steve MacMillan : We\u2019ll have most of the team in place by the end of this fiscal year and we\u2019ve got a lot of the key team. We had quietly started to rebuild the team particularly in Europe late last year, that\u2019s when we brought the new molecular diagnostics leader in, the new service leader was hired in the last quarter. Our new breast health person over, so I think we feel pretty good about the team coming together by the end of this fiscal year and some of them are already hitting the ground and getting it. But it\u2019s definitely more of a 17,18,19 as we really get into the longer term planning. And we are really upsizing that team. We don\u2019t want just some quick wins for the sake of wins; we want it to be the enduring business because part of what we got in the last couple of years was the occasional big win but it didn\u2019t necessarily translated the ongoing business. Mike Watts : Operator, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity Mark Massaro : Hey guys thank you. So you noted that you are closing the Bedford, Mass, facility. Can you comment on timing and cost savings? And related to that, have you been able to realize any benefits related to optimizing your supply chain? Steve MacMillan : Yes I think starting on the second part, optimizing the supply chain you are clearly seeing it in our gross margin. I think the part that might have gotten missed in my script and it was the part that probably shocked me the most when I was going through the financial for the quarter. Our absolute cost of goods is lower this year than last. So we are producing more product at less absolute money than last and that\u2019s clearly a result of some of the procurement and productivity initiatives that Mike Kelly, our supply chain leaders put in place under Bob McMahon\u2019s guidance and a lot of help from Eric Compton as well. The Bedford facility will be closing later this later, candidly it\u2019s going to have a fairly minimal impact on the true P&L because it\u2019s the least facility and we are stuck with a bunch of lease costs and other stuff in there. But it\u2019s -- we are still just doing a lot of cleaning up through the company and we\u2019ve consistently said we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in the last couple of years and there is still a lot of opportunity ahead to be better on so many fronts. Mark Massaro : Thank you. Nice quarter. Steve MacMillan : Hey well thank you. Thanks a lot, Mark. And I think that wraps it up. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. Have a good evening.",

Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to the Hologic Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Matt, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Michael J. Watts - Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications : Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today, then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them today. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived on our website through August 26. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known as well as unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also, during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Our results were very solid and illustrate how far we've come and how quickly we're progressing on our journey from turnaround story to sustainable growth company. Revenues of $717.4 million exceeded expectations as all four of our businesses grew on a global basis, despite a difficult comparison resulting from very strong results in the prior year period. In our last call, we focused on the emergence of our Surgical business as a growth driver. This quarter, Surgical led the way with exceptional performance, but we're also pleased with how our breast imaging, molecular diagnostics and cytology businesses performed and we made progress in strengthening our international franchises, which we believe will be important contributors to future growth. Our performance this quarter highlighted the breadth of our top-line growth drivers, which is often overlooked even as performance has improved ahead of schedule in many areas, new drivers are beginning to emerge thanks to the deliberate and proactive efforts of our team. And while this quarter is only a single data point, our results do give us increased confidence that revenue growth can continue at a healthy pace in the future. Our third quarter results also demonstrated once again our ability to increase profitability above and beyond already high levels. We boosted both gross and operating margins even while reinvesting aggressively to drive future growth. We've been pleasantly surprised at our ability to achieve productivity gains and enjoying many other levers to drive earnings growth. For example, strategies that we had expected to play out over the longer-term horizon are materializing sooner than expected. Various internal restructuring yielded a lower tax rate in the quarter and the combination of strong cash flows and market volatility enabled us to buyback more shares. Together, all these efforts led to a very robust net margin of 20.2% in the quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.51 and excellent EPS growth of 18.6% on a non-GAAP basis. Based on the strong earnings performance, we are raising our financial guidance for the year and now expect non-GAAP EPS of between $1.93 and a $1.94. As a reminder, the midpoint of this new guidance is roughly $0.12 above our guidance at the beginning of the year. We're clearly exceeding our own expectations for a sustainable bottom line growth, and feel good about our future prospects in this regard as well. With that introduction out of the way, I'd like to walk through our revenue highlights in the balance of my remarks then Bob will discuss expenses, the rest of our financials and our updated guidance. Unless otherwise noted, percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. Starting with the big picture, total revenues were $717.4 million in the third quarter, an increase of 3.4% on a reported basis or 3.6% in constant currency terms. These figures include roughly $8 million headwind from divested and discontinued products, such as Sentinelle breast coils and the molecular test for cystic fibrosis. If we were to back out this headwind, total revenues would have been grown 4.8% in constant currency terms. These growth rates are stacked on top of a very difficult comp from the prior year. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2015, total revenues increased 12.2% in constant currency. So our ability to jump over a high bar this quarter, gives us increasing confidence in the ability of our commercial organization to drive solid growth next year and beyond. In terms of geography, U.S. sales grew 4.7% in the third quarter, continuing a string of good results and indicating the improvements we've made in commercial execution. We continue to enjoy strong leadership positions and good momentum in the domestic marketplace. International sales declined 1.2% on a reported basis, driven primarily by blood screening as expected. In constant currency, international sales declined 0.4%, essentially flat, and we were to normalize for divested and discontinued products, international sales would have increased slightly. It's also worth mentioning that international sales increased sequentially as well, an encouraging sign. Overall, we believe, our international results in the third quarter show we are building a foundation for strong and consistent growth over time. Toward that end, our Chief Operating Officer, Eric Compton, has made good progress in filling out our international leadership team in recent months. In last quarter's call, we highlighted new executives in-charge of European Breast Health and Service, as well as marketing, molecular diagnostics, surgical and regulatory. More recently, we have added new geographic sales leaders to run Latin America, Canada and Asia Pacific, so our efforts to upgrade talent are coming together nicely. Shifting to the types of revenue we generate, I want to emphasize it for all the attention our mammography systems received capital equipment represented just 23.4% of revenue in the third quarter. Said another way, more than 76% of our sales were recurring. More specifically, disposables such as our diagnostic assays and surgical tools represented 60.4% of sales, while service and other totaled 16.2% of sales. Now, let me discuss divisional revenues in the third quarter. I will start with the growth leader in the quarter, our GYN Surgical business. A couple of years ago, no one would have said those words in the same sentence but today our team has achieved what others thought impossible. Worldwide, Surgical sales were a $102 million surpassing $100 million on a quarterly basis for the first time. Sales grew, 19.8%, in constant currency, the fastest growth rate for this division in recent memory. In the United States, the team delivered double-digit growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. And internationally, the business grew by nearly 40% albeit of a very small base. As many of you know, a competitor recently withdrew its endometrial ablation product from the market and to capitalize on this, we increased marketing and sales activities in the quarter. As a result, global sales of our NovaSure product totaled $61 million, an increase of 14.6% in constant currency. Not to be overlooked, sales from our MyoSure products for uterine fibroid removal, also continue to show strength. Global MyoSure sales of $40.8 million increased 29.8% in constant currency. Now let's turn to Breast Health, which has received a lot of attention in recent months. While this is understandable and appropriate, it's just as important to appreciate that Hologic is much more than a mammography company today. Hopefully our results this quarter help illustrate that point, and provide confidences that the entire company can continue to grow revenue solidly and EPS much faster even as growth from 3D adoption naturally slows. We're very pleased with our Breast Health performance in the quarter. Global sales of $282.5 million increased 1.1%. Breast imaging sales totaled $239.3 million, up 2.3% in constant currency driven by continued adoption of our Genius 3D mammography systems. Domestic imaging sales grew more rapidly and exceeded our internal expectations based on Genius placements, which increased both sequentially and year-over-year. We estimate that Genius systems are continuing to gain market share, while our investments in customer marketing help us maintain stable prices, amid fierce competition. We still have lots to look forward to in Breast Health. Genius systems represent less than 40% of our own mammography installed base today and by our estimate, less than 25% of the market as a whole and we remain confident in the long-term conversion opportunity, as evidence continues to mount on the benefits of Hologic's Genius exams for patients and physicians and as we differentiate ourselves competitively. As evidence of this, mammography customers recently surveyed by the independent market research firm KLAS scored Hologic highest in overall product satisfaction. One Director of Radiology said, \"Hologic seems to be the only company that really understands the tomosynthesis market. It was clear from our implementation and our usage of their system that they are a full generation ahead of other vendors. Everybody else is playing catch-up.\" This is only one anecdotal comment, but it's consistent with the customer feedback we receive everyday and validates our leadership position. As our installed base of Genius 3D systems grows, our sales and marketing programs are focusing on ways to leverage this leadership position. For example, service revenue is becoming increasingly important and represents an annuity that complements and smoothes out our capital sales. Some of you may not appreciate the size of our service business in Breast Health. To frame it for you, service revenue in this business exceeded $100 million in the quarter for the first time and grew at a mid-single digit rate. Similarly, we have revamped our research and development efforts to capitalize on our growing Genius footprint and generate a more continuous stream of product innovations. For example, we recently launched our new Affirm Prone Biopsy System, which provides a better patient experience and enables doctors to capitalize on the increased sensitivity of 3D technology. Although it's still early days, customer feedback on the system has been positive both in the United States and internationally. Another component of future growth in Breast Health will be our international business. While we still have a lot of work to do here, we are making good progress and are optimistic that the business is becoming healthier and more predictable as we create the foundation for solid growth in 2017 and beyond. In the third quarter, international Breast Health sales declined 2.9% in constant currency. But if we back out the headwind from divested and discontinued products, sales would have been flat, and on a sequential basis, sales increased slightly. With this in mind, I want to remind everyone that last year's international Breast Health number was exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter and as a result, we anticipate a year-over-year decline in the coming quarter before the business returns to growth in 2017. As we move into 2017, we do believe that the combination of multiple tailwinds : a still underpenetrated 3D opportunity, growing service revenue, a revitalized R&D effort, and international expansion, will enable Breast Health to be an important contributor to corporate growth. Now, let's cover Diagnostics, which is our largest business and greatest source of non-GAAP operating profit. Diagnostics reported sales of $309.9 million in the third quarter, growing 1.2% in constant currency. Within Diagnostics, our cytology and molecular businesses performed well, while our blood screening business declined as expected. Global sales of cytology and perinatal products totaled $122.2 million, growing 3.9% on a constant currency basis. Breaking this down a little further, both our ThinPrep and fetal fibronectin franchises grew in the United States and internationally. Despite lingering headwinds from Pap interval expansion domestically. Turning to molecular diagnostics, we posted global sales of $131.8 million, up 6.0% in constant currency. Excluding sales of our discontinued cystic fibrosis product, molecular sales would've grown at a high-single-digit range rate. Our domestic business was solid, as our fully automated Panther system continues to accumulate new placements and competitive wins and as utilization of our assays for trichomonas, HPV and chlamydia/gonorrhea continues to grow. But the real standout here, was our international business. Over the last couple quarters, international molecular sales had turned slightly positive under new leadership. And we had added viral load assays to the Panther menu. Building on this, the business took a significant step ahead in the third quarter with constant currency growth exceeding 20%. In addition, we had a record quarter of Panther placements outside the United States coupled with a significant step up in per instrument utilization. All these data points have us feeling good about the potential for international molecular diagnostics to become a new driver of growth for the company over time. Shifting back to the United States for a moment, during the third quarter we gained an emergency use authorization for our Zika virus test for diagnostic use. In addition, blood banks began testing donated blood for Zika with our Procleix assay under an Investigational New Drug protocol. While we do not expect significant sales from these two new products, both of which run on the Panther system, our ability to rapidly develop these tests, shows we can react quickly to public health emergencies in close cooperation with regulators and customers. In addition, should the Zika virus spread in United States, we will be well positioned in the marketplace. Apart from the highlight of the Zika IND, our blood screening business declined in the quarter as expected. Worldwide sales of blood screening products were $55.9 million down 12.9%, with all the decline coming outside the United States. As in the second quarter, this decline was mainly due to stronger ordering in the prior-year period to support testing at the Japanese Red Cross combined with continued trends toward lower blood utilization. Before I turn the call over to Bob. Let me wrap up the review of product sales by mentioning that our Skeletal Health division posted revenues of $23.0 million in the quarter. This represented a constant currency increase of 4.8% with growth both domestically and overseas primarily driven by our Horizon bone density scanner. So, in conclusion, we are very pleased with our third quarter financial results and with the progress we've made towards building a sustainable growth company. Despite very challenging prior year comps, all four of our businesses grew in the quarter reflecting the many growth drivers at our disposal. Sales growth in the U.S. Breast Health slowed due to a challenging prior year comp, but remained healthy. At the same time, strong results in Surgical, molecular diagnostics, and cytology demonstrated that Hologic is much more than a mammography company. We continue to execute well in the United States and made good progress in building a foundation for international growth. We once again expanded profit margins and redeployed capital contributing to EPS growth at the highest rate in many years. Now, I'll hand the call over to Bob. Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I am going to walk through the rest of our third quarter income statement, highlight a few balance sheet and cash flow items, and then wrap up with updated financial guidance for 2016. As a reminder, I will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. As Steve discussed, our revenue performance in the third quarter exceeded expectations, highlighted by global growth in all four business segments. This growth, coupled with favorable product mix and productivity gains, again drove improvements in gross and operating margins. At the same time, we continued to invest in initiatives that position us for long-term, sustainable growth. Net-net, we delivered EPS growth well in excess of sales, reflecting the impact of operational improvements, capital deployment and a lower effective tax rate. Now let's dive deeper into the third quarter income statement. Gross margin of 65.7% increased 50 basis points, and benefited from the growth of our Surgical, cytology and perinatal, and Aptima franchises. We continue to manage pricing well, as we focus on commercial excellence and our marketing initiatives highlight the clinical and economic value of our products. In addition, our operations teams continue to drive efficiencies and reduce costs across our supply chain. Total operating expenses of $229.2 million increased 3.1% in the third quarter. This increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expense, which increased 15.5%. Given our gross margin expansion, we have invested deliberately and opportunistically in commercial areas where we see a good return. These include our Genius marketing campaign in Breast Health, our cervical cancer co-testing initiatives in Diagnostics, and efforts to gain competitive market share with NovaSure. These strategic initiatives are paying off through increased brand awareness, market share gains, and price stability, all of which contribute to higher sales. Despite the increased sales and marketing spending, operating margins improved 60 basis points in the quarter, slightly more than gross margins, based primarily on leverage in general and administrative expenses. Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $33.9 million was 12% lower than in prior year due to our efforts to both reduce and restructure our debt. And in addition, our tax rate is improving earlier than expected, based on changes in our income mix and internal restructurings implemented this year and last. We now estimate that our effective tax rate will be around 32% for the full-year 2016. We trued up to this rate in the third quarter, reducing our effective rate to 30.6%, but we expect the rate to normalize back to 32% in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our tax rate was 34.25% just last year, so we are making good progress. We are pleased that all these efforts have enabled us to grow net profits even faster than operating profit. Our net margin was 20.2% in the quarter, a very strong level, and an improvement of 190 basis points over the prior year. To wrap up the income statement review, diluted shares outstanding were 282 million in the third quarter, roughly 10 million lower than a year ago. Over the course of this year, we have worked to pay down a portion of in-the-money converts to reduce their dilutive effects. And more recently, we have taken advantage of market volatility to repurchase our common stock. In the third quarter, we bought back 3 million shares of stock for $101.2 million, which exhausted our prior, $250 million repurchase authorization. Recently, our board of directors has approved an additional $500 million repurchase program, and we're very pleased to have that arrow in our quiver going forward. While we're pleased with the progress we've made thus far in improving our capital structure and achieving a more competitive tax rate compared to other medtech companies, we know we can continue to improve. And we believe these improvements will help us deliver EPS growth much faster than revenue over an extended period of time. Now I'd like to highlight a few balance sheet and cash flow items, beginning with inventory. Inventory decreased by $14.5 million, or 4.9%, compared to a year ago, despite a 3.4% increase in sales. This speaks to strong alignment between the operations and sales teams, who know that every dollar saved in inventory serves as dry powder for debt reduction, acquisitions or share repurchase. And speaking of our debt, at the end of the third quarter, total debt outstanding was $3.4 billion, a decrease of more than $0.5 billion from a year ago. During the quarter, we paid off $175 million that had been outstanding on our $1 billion revolving line of credit using proceeds borrowed at a lower interest rate under a new, $200 million accounts receivable securitization program. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, totaled $262.5 million in the third quarter, an increase of 5.1%. Based on EBITDA of more than $1 billion over the last 12 months, our leverage ratio, calculated as net principal debt over EBITDA, stands at 2.97, the first time this ratio has fallen below 3 since the Gen-Probe acquisition. In addition, we are well on the way to achieving our target leverage ratio of 2.5 times by the end of fiscal 2017. Strong profit growth and lower debt have continued to improve our return on invested capital, or ROIC, which was 12.3% on a trailing 12 months basis, a 170 basis point increase over the prior year. Robust cash flows and minimal capital expenditures continue to be hallmarks of Hologic's financial performance. Operating cash flow was $246.2 million in the third quarter, an increase of 1.6%. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $225.1 million. Notably, free cash flow was 55.1% higher than non-GAAP net income. Our financial health clearly extends well beyond our P&L as we continue to focus on working capital, and control our capital expenditures. Now let's turn to our updated financial guidance for the full year and fourth quarter. At the midpoint, we are raising both revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance based on the company's strong performance in the third quarter. Let's cover the revenue guidance first. For the full year, we are increasing our previous guidance by $10 million at the low end, and now expect total revenues of between $2.82 billion and $2.83 billion for fiscal 2016. This represents solid, mid-single-digit growth of 4.3% to 4.6% on a reported basis, or 5% to 5.3% in constant currency terms, despite the headwind from divested and discontinued products. With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance obviously implies revenues of $714 million to $724 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period, which is another tough comp. This range reflects revenue growth of 1.6% to 3.0% on a reported basis, or 2.1% to 3.6% in constant currency terms. In addition, our guidance includes an expected headwind of roughly $4.5 million from divested and discontinued products, which depresses our constant currency guidance by about 60 basis points. Based on our revenue range, our fourth quarter guidance implies that revenues will be about the same, or slightly above our third quarter actuals. We no longer expect the significant sequential step-up implied by our prior guidance, as some revenue that we originally forecasted for the fourth quarter materialized a little earlier than expected. In addition, we forecast another quarter of incremental softness in blood screening sales, as inventory levels and ordering patterns continue to normalize. Turning to our updated bottom-line guidance, we now forecast non-GAAP EPS of between $1.93 and $1.94 for the full year. This translates to reported growth between 15.6% and 16.2%, and constant currency growth between 16.9% and 17.5%. This earnings guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates, a full-year tax rate of 32%, and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 288 million for the full year. This full-year guidance translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.49 to $0.50 in the fourth quarter. This represents growth of 14% to 16.3% on a reported basis, or 15% to 17.3% in constant currency terms. Implicit in our fourth quarter guidance is a sequential increase in operating expenses, several million dollars of which relate to a change in the retirement provisions of our equity plan that will make it more consistent with our peers. Before opening up the call for questions, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the financial results we have achieved so far in fiscal 2016. From a revenue perspective, our Surgical business continues to exceed expectations. We still enjoy momentum with Genius 3D mammography, remain pleased with our molecular diagnostics and ThinPrep businesses, and are turning the corner internationally. And from an earnings perspective, we continue to generate tremendous growth through gross and operating margin improvement, a lower tax rate, and capital deployment. With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. And we'll move to our first question, which is from Jonathan Groberg with UBS. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks a million and congratulations on another solid quarter and raise. Can you maybe talk a little bit, Steve, about international and Diagnostics. I think, you said that was up 20% currency neutral, record Panther placements. Was there anything beyond new management, better execution, that benefit from the Zika that you mentioned. I'm just kind of curious if there was any \u2013 if you can \u2013 any other color you can provide on that? Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Jon. Thank you. It's really, to be very clear it is the new management that we put in place. We actually hired a new leader for our European Diagnostics business, really just about a year ago, last summer and he has been revamping the team getting up to speed. And then, we did launch, we got the clearance if you recall early this year \u2013 really early this calendar year to the viral loads. We got the HCV, HPV and HIV. So they're rolling out in conjunction with the new leadership team and the Panther placements and those things are really driving it. Zika by the way is not in those numbers, so that's really just our core women's health assays plus the viral load. So I think what we are excited about as we started to look forward in Diagnostics. Molecular has effectively been non-existent outside the U.S., I mean, not non-existent but pretty small. And now, we're really getting that footprint and as we're placing these Panthers starting to feel like okay, this is the beginning of something that really is sustainable and has some good growth ahead of it. As well, the cytology business continues to tick along as well with some modest growth outside the U.S. also. So I think (33:07) Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer : I was going to say \u2013 hey, Jonathan, this is Bob. Just to build on what Steve was saying. I mean, I think, really what we're seeing right now is a very competitive assay menu when we are going up against the competitive nature with the viral loads and the STD. And so I think, we've got as competitive of a menu as anyone else does. But I think what we have seen is a series of strong quarterly placements for the last several quarters and we are starting to get those back on. They are up and running in that test of record. And so I think, we are seeing that pull through and seeing the benefits of the Panther system, which we've seen here in the U.S. around benefits of automation and so forth, which I think will really play well, particularly in Europe. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : I guess, if I can just follow up, the basis for my question is, is there anything that you can learn from kind of the new management and how long it took and what you are seeing that is it all applicable to what you may be able to achieve in Breast Health or are they just two different businesses? Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : They are different businesses but there is a lot to learn. I think, Jonathan, probably the way to think about it is, as we started to describe, really about this time last year, we really are moving in \u2013 we are really a start-up company outside the U.S. franchise-by-franchise. I think, what we've seen, the new leader within the European Diagnostics business, he is bringing a level of focus, he is building out a team. There were some people there, he has changed some out, gotten the others to operate up, but he really is starting to build it up. And I think that's what Eric Compton has really been driving, especially this year is getting the right people in place for the longer-term. I'd give, just anecdotally, Bob and I happened to be in Japan last week and again, half of our employees in Japan have been with us less than a year. So it truly is \u2013 we look at a company of our size from the outside and think okay, they just have to get it going and turnaround what's there, this really is building it out. So I think, we've seen some emerging signs in Diagnostics over the last couple of quarters, didn't want to quite say yet until we thought okay, this is now sustainable. And I think we're in the same infrastructure building in Breast Health and other stuff. Breast Health because more dealers involved, will probably take a little bit longer. But I will tell you underneath the surface we're feeling very good where as I always say, the infrastructure gets better before the numbers show it, and I think that's kind of the stages that we're in right now. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Congratulations again. Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : We'll move now to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Steve, wondering if you could talk about the sustainability of GYN Surg. Obviously you've seen some good strength there, particular on NovaSure, are you able to disaggregate how much of that's coming from the Thermochoice recall and maybe picking up some share there? Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Great question, Tycho. I think the way we should think about it right now is we're clearly benefiting and most of the NovaSure growth I think we should say is candidly coming from the competitive recall, of which we still have another, call like it quarter, quarter-and-a-half-ish ahead of us with that. Having said that, I'd remind everybody, as we said, this was our sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth both domestically and globally for our GYN Surg business. So that business had turned it around and strengthened dramatically and was then well poised when the competitive issue happened. So, we're taking advantage of it. MyoSure continues to grow. And I think the way we think about our GYN Surg business here is, we're not ready to declare it a sustainable double-digit grower, but it's clearly a very solid grower. And again, this is one where internationally we're just in a very early stages as well. So, again, it's moved from what I'd call an appendage on the company a couple years ago to something that can actually start to meaningfully contribute to our total growth. It's also hugely accretive to our gross margin, operating margin. It's a great cash generator. There's a lot of good things and it's helping on our tax rate, frankly. Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Hey, Tycho, this is Bob. Just to build on that, we actually referenced some of the exceeding expectations. We actually think that some of the share gains materialized a little earlier in the third quarter than what we were expecting in the fourth quarter really on the back of the work that the team has done there and the investments we've made in sales and marketing. So, that's some of the \u2013 we think that there still is legs there, as Steve said, but that ramp has actually happened nicely for us in the third quarter. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, and then just a follow-up to the question earlier on Diagnostics, it's early days for viral load. I don't know if you can put any metrics around how that business has tracked relative to your expectations but can you also talk about whether that's a good proxy for when you ultimately do roll out in the U.S. and what's the latest thinking on timing. Could you have viral load here by the end of next year or is that more of a 2018 event? Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. It's still pretty small within Europe. It's not yet material to the company but I think the initial signs are pretty good. And what's I think very encouraging to us is in Europe, we're launching from a much weaker base than where we are when we bring the viral loads to the United States. So, when we bring the viral loads, which to the second part of your question is really in 2018, a fiscal 2018 and probably, really second halfish of 2018 by the time we have all three. So, we will have likely one much sooner but by the time we have HPV, HCV and HIV, it will be later on in 2018, and by that point we will be launching in the U.S. from our much bigger install base, much stronger position overall. So I think the fact we are able to even have some success in Europe in other people's backyards is already an increasingly, encouraging sign for it, when we do come to these States. Operator : At this time, we will move to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Bill. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Good afternoon everyone. So, Steve, just start off on tomo here, I think your tomo was little more positive perhaps than last quarter and I am curious if we can dig into why? I mean, does this have anything to do with the competitive dynamic? I mean, it strikes me that, there is potentially an opportunity here over several years to take some incremental share from your two principal competitors in the mammography space domestically. Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure, Bill. Probably, because I just met with our Breast Health sales leadership team earlier today but no, aside from that, we continue to feel very good about where that business is going. I think some of the comments \u2013 one of my comments on the last call might have been more misinterpreted. I think what we are really seeing fundamentally in the Breast Health business is our ability to take more market share than I ever would have imagined call it two years, two-and-a-half years ago. But I think the business is also very encouraging. It's going to be stronger for longer and while there has been so much obsession from the outside of what I call the peak followed by the cliff, we still see \u2013 we are still, as we said in the script, we are less than 40% even into our own install base. We are less than 25% even into the installed base in the market place. And as we are gaining market share it says there is still a lot of runway ahead of us. What I have been trying to signal all along is don't expect the kind of growth rates we'd had historically, but the business fundamentally has a lot of great quarters still ahead of it. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Fantastic. Separately on Surgical, just spend a couple of minutes here on the Bovie Medical deal. Is this a sort of, I guess deal we should be expecting or deals we should be expecting in Surgical going forward, kind of a try it before you buy it sort of deal, Steve, or are you still looking around at additional products for the bag? Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Thanks. As we've said, we are clearly looking for additional products for Surgical. Having said that, right now, I'm really glad we don't have much more because we've been handed this opportunity to permanently increase our market share, obviously with a competitive situation. And I think as we go forward, we are just beginning the business development efforts, and I think you'll see a series of things, whether it's a very limited distribution deal like this one where we are trying it with a few reps and that were, two, outright right acquisitions. I would say on the business development front, everybody should know, we've gotten much more active. We said no to a number of things over the last quarter or two. And, I think a lot of that has been our teams getting very much more disciplined about what we are looking at and more active. And I think frankly getting to the stage where you're saying no to deals and why is the no, and what you should we be looking for, I think, as we go into 2017 feeling better and better that we'll be finding some things that we will be saying yes to. But certainly some maybe distribution, some will be outright acquisition. I wouldn't view that as the model of what we'll necessarily be doing, we'll just be flexible. Operator : At this time, we'll move to Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Maybe first question for Steve, second question for Bob. Steve, in the third quarter there were a number of nice developments. Molecular is better than expected, particularly OUS, and Surgical growth was quite strong. You remain enthused about a firm in Brevera. Recognizing one quarter usually doesn't make a trend, would it be fair to say you feel a bit better about your ability to power through the impact of US 3D growth plateauing than you did maybe even a quarter ago? And then for Bob, you beat the midpoint of guidance by I think it is $17 million this quarter. You're increasing full-year guidance to midpoint by only $5 million. I was hoping you could provide a bridge between the quarter and the full-year guide. Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thanks, Doug. I would say I feel a little bit better. I think the truth is, I've always felt a lot better than I probably communicated on the last call. I truly believe it was a complete overreaction. And my strength does continue or my confidence continues to build as I watch each quarter play out. We were going up against a monster comp this quarter. And our team is still really, call it two years old or less for the most part, and wanting to make sure that we can deliver before we get out ahead of ourselves. So I think I feel a little bit better, but I think overall I feel very confident about where we're headed. I felt more confident than came off last time. So it's not a dramatic shift in how I feel, but it's clearly probably a dramatic shift in the perception and I own that, but feeling very good about a lot of things we've going on. Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Doug. Hey, this is Bob. Just to follow-up on the second part of your question. Yeah, as you mentioned, we did raise the guidance by $5 million at the midpoint versus the $17 million beat. If you recall our previous guidance included a fairly sharp sequential increase in Q4 revenue and some of that revenue as I mentioned actually earlier materialized a little earlier than expected places like our Surgical business. And then beyond that, we do see potential for incremental kind of sequential weakness within our blood screening businesses as that business continues to normalize from an inventory perspective. So that said, our fourth quarter guidance still implies solid year-over-year growth despite another challenging comparison and a headwind of about 60 basis points from those divested in discontinued products. So we feel good about the guidance and just as importantly, maybe more importantly, our EPS guidance is even stronger, multiple \u2013 a series of multiples above that for the fourth quarter growing at 14% to 16% on an as reported basis. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, very helpful. Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thanks, Doug. Operator : We'll move along to Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks, and congrats on the quarter. I want to start with some of the commentary around the service contracts in Breast Health. And I think I caught this was the first quarter over $100 million. I know there is some moving parts around warranty and just how that's rolled through since you hit the inflection at this point last year in terms of the instruments replacements. Could you walk us through what you think the sustainable rate for that is and whether you're seeing better attachment with 3D placement? Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Jack, this is Bob. I think from an attachment rate perspective, we continue to feel very good about our attachment rate. We haven't seen any incremental change either up or down and have continued to be very strong in excess of 85%. And so, I think that's a real testament to our sales teams and more importantly our service teams and the customer satisfaction that we have with our products. So, I don't see any change there and I think what you would expect to see is a continued \u2013 the nice part about that is it's a nice solid annuity in that probably mid-single digit growth rate area going forward. Some of this is we are actually transitioning from a 2D system to a 3D system where you'll get the incremental benefit associated with the higher service contract and then the beauty of actually the competitive share gains is you get the full benefit of the service contract on that. And we are seeing both of those as well. So, we think that that has a lot of legs, not only for the rest of this year but certainly into 2017 and beyond. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And one on the early success with viral load in Europe. Just where you are seeing some wins \u2013 where do you think you're differentiated in the market? Could you just walk us through the value proposition for the Panther? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think it's the same benefits largely we have here which is workflow automation and the Panther system, the footprint is a very nice addition for Europe. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : We'll take a question now from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, David. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, Steve, I was hoping you could \u2013 it's hard to miss this qualitative commentary around stronger for longer. You just said it so much this call, I thought maybe you would make it the new Hologic tag line. But the reality is, I would like you to maybe take that qualitative commentary and I wonder if you could make it quantitative for us next year. I know it is too early to give guidance, but I think about the fourth quarter, there is stability. Your guidance for the fourth quarter suggests that stability continues. So, as you think about next year, low-single digits versus mid-single digit revenue growth for the business. Are you comfortable in more of a mid-single digit outlook? Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey David. Based on the market reaction following our last call, I think we'll stick to giving the guidance in our fourth quarter call rather than commenting on a number before we formally approve the budget. Having said that, we do believe we'll have a solid year in 2017, and we'd clearly be disappointed with the low-single digit 3% number that was mentioned last time. So wherever \u2013 and I think the bigger point I was trying to make last time is \u2013 by the way wherever revenue guidance ends up, we believe we'll deliver EPS growth at a multiple of that. I think that was the broader point I was trying to make that how better we're feeling about the earnings growth, but do feel incrementally better about the sales growth. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. I think that resonated. Thank you, Steve. And then a couple points, maybe one for Steve and one for Bob. The first thing, Steve, M&A has not been a part of the story here since you arrived. But given Bob's comments about the leverage and where you will be by the end of 2017, I wonder, is 2017 a hunting period for M&A and sort of 2018 is when we should expect more action or given what you see on cash flow and what Bob said about the levels of debt by the end of 2017, is next year a year where M&A can become more active in terms of deal consummation? And could you give us any sense, if that is true, kind of size of those transactions? Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : David, as you know it's really hard to predict on exact timing. I'd say we're looking at stuff right now, so it could be any time. Having said that, just given the pragmatic realities of where we stand in our current fiscal year 2017, I would expect we'll probably actually execute something in the 2017 timeframe. Our hunting activity is clearly ramped up in I'd say the last three months to six months in our activities. And I think 2017 will be likely that certainly would contribute as well to 2018 growth, some of that. But again, we will \u2013 as you know, we will pounce when the opportunities are right, and feel like we are in a position that we could today. We are going to continue, as we are talking about, bolt on, bite size kinds of things. We are not looking at billion dollar deals. Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer : And I think, David, just to build on that, I mean, I think, what we feel, we are very comfortable is that we have plenty of capacity to be able to do things when we want to and we will look at many more than we will ever do, and we will be very disciplined in our approach to do deals. And so, I mean, just in this last quarter, free cash flow of $225 million gives us a lot of flexibility, and we continue to use all levers to continue to drive that higher. Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And we do, and David, I think you know from a couple of years back looking at it \u2013 and talk about our exec comp plan, we are very focused on ROIC, and given the history of this company and where we've been and that's still been part of a decision to say no to a few of the things we've been looking at. So, we'll continue to be very disciplined on that. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. I think investors will certainly appreciate that, Steve. And then, lastly, Bob, just looking at the fourth quarter guidance, as I mentioned the revenue trends look stable with the third quarter. Is there any reason why margins in the fourth quarter wouldn't show the kind of year-on-year improvement you've been showing through the prior three quarters? Just our back of the envelope math suggest the fourth quarter margin won't be as robust year-on-year relative to the prior three quarters? And I'll jump back in queue. Thanks, guys. Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Thanks. Just quickly, we talked about \u2013 we anticipate continued commercial investments that are going to drive incrementally or sequentially from Q3 to Q4, and probably more importantly the change in our retirement plan that I mentioned before will be effective in our fourth quarter, that's roughly a $0.01 impact to the quarter. Operator : Moving along to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks a bunch, guys. Bob, just a question on tax rate, to start. You mentioned in your prepared comments some of the internal restructuring initiatives you've got. Curious if that's an ongoing process that could carry through to next year. As I look back on your prior comments on tax rate in general, you characterized 2016 as a foundational year with leverage to show up next year. So, given that you said things are moving a little faster, just curious if a lot of the leverage that you had hoped for next year has already played out or if we're still kind of in process? Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So we feel very good about the progress that we've been making, Isaac, and have been working very hard. As you know, our tax rate is much higher than any of our med-tech peers. And so that is one of the big focus areas that my team has got. What I would say is it's too early to tell you specifically what our number in 2017 is. We actually have been able to pull forward but what I will tell you is over time we continue to have opportunities there and expect that effective tax rate to go down. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then just the last one, coming back to mammography, you covered a lot of ground there. But if I look at what is going on broadly in capital equipment in med-tech, there's been pretty good pockets of strength across various categories. And I think yourselves and your competitors have talked about maybe a little less growth in mammo than you would have otherwise guessed given where we are in the adoption curve for tomo. So, I'm just curious if you could put any more color on the feedback you're getting, at least in the US, with regards to customer appetite for mammography equipment. Is there anything out there that's kind of causing a temporary slowdown in the adoption process that might explain the trend here versus other categories of equipment? Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, Isaac, we're not seeing any real slowdown or pushback from the customer. It's as much a capacity issue of the hospitals to take what they have and natural replacement cycles more than anything. And I'd say, if anything we've had more customers pull stuff a little bit forward because they wanted to compete and offer it, so we're not seeing that. There is just \u2013 I kind of remind people, there is a fundamental limitation to how many systems can be installed and used. The auto industry is an example, right? If every company launched a new product next year, auto sales don't suddenly jump up from 16 million to 20 million. There is just a natural rate of replacement that is still happening here and I think that's what lead us back to the stronger for longer that the market is not going to grow by 25% this year but it's going to be there and it's there for us as we keep converting. Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Hey, Isaac, this is Bob. Just one of the things that we look at that that we continue to feel good about and pleased with is the actual bookings as well, those continue to meet and exceed our expectations. Operator : We'll move now to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys, congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe I'll start with a big-picture question, Steve. I know you said that you wouldn't comment on the 2017 outlook, but just maybe if I think out loud on some of the moving parts for next year, right, so it looks like Diagnostics international has to come in better. We're feeling better about Breast Health. And when we really think about next year, you have blood coming, declining maybe for the first half of next year but offsetting that you have GYN. Is that sort of the mix of when you talk about balance, is that how we're supposed to think about growth for next year? Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Vijay, I'd love to give you a better answer but I really want to get the budget nailed but I think we're feeling good about the trajectory of where we are headed. And sorry I can't be specific at this point but... Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : No, no fair enough and... Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It didn't serve me well last time to \u2013 pre-talk about the next year. Fundamentally, we're feeling good about where this company is headed. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : That's fantastic and maybe one question on breast imaging or interventional breast, I guess. I know you guys launched a table launch and it maybe looked \u2013 a tad little softer on the interventional side. We don't talk a whole lot about it. I'm just trying to understand is this a function of \u2013 does this allow you to bundle your table along with mammo systems. Is there an opportunity in that area? Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. What's really in the interventional today is mostly the disposable activity and that has been under a little bit of pressure. I think as we do launch the table, whether it's bundling per se or just the fact that we've got probably the best product and we've got a great sales team I think we have good hopes for the Affirm table and that'll really be \u2013 we're in the very early stages right now of getting the quotes and getting the orders, basically the sales process. We think that will be a nice contributor to start to kick in here in 2017 for us and it will help just the overall Breast Health business. Michael J. Watts - Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications : Operator, I think we have time for one or two more quick questions. Operator : Okay. Next question is from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks. So maybe just staying on Breast Imaging for a minute. There is still lack of insurance coverage for I think most women in United States for 3D imaging. Is there any progress on expanded coverage at this point or anything we can look forward to over the next few quarters? Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think Raj, we are deeply engaged in a lot of discussions. And I think, I've said historically that was not \u2013 the private pay competency was not something we had as much in our company but our team has really made a lot of progress just in the last \u2013 I'd say, last six months or so. It's hard to predict timing and I candidly for any modeling or whatever, I wouldn't assume we necessarily have anything this calendar year. Having said that, we are getting a couple of state mandates. And if you saw recently both the State of Illinois and the State of Connecticut have now mandated coverage, and we're probably overall in the 40% to 45-ish percent coverage, maybe up to 50% in terms of covered lives but the private pay piece will be probably the next step up for us. And having said that, just like prior to getting the incremental reimbursement from CMS, we're not sitting there waiting for this to come to sell our systems. Operator : We'll take the final question from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks. Just a quick one. I wasn't sure if you provided it, but the OUS Breast Health growth rate, did you guys give that number and can you remind us what it was last quarter and what the trend was? Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Oh yeah, go ahead Bob. Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Down in constant currency 2.9% and if you adjust it for the divested and discontinued, it's roughly flat. Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : And what was it last...? Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And sequentially it was about flattish... Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer : Right. Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : As well Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer : Right. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : And the year-over-year rate (01:00:27) last quarter? Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer : Sorry, you faded out. Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We just got a garble. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : I was just looking for the trend, what was that year-over-year growth rate trend from last quarter to the current quarter? Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer : Improved. (01:00:44) Yes. Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. This quarter versus same quarter last of last year net of divestitures was about flat yeah. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings calls. Have a good evening.",

Good afternoon and welcome to the Hologic Incorporated Fourth Quarter fiscal 2016 earnings conference call. My name is Kamille and I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Kamille. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us for Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the Company's Chairman, President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today, then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the investor section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived on our website through November 25. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release, and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings release. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Mike and good afternoon everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We once again posted strong results that illustrate the progress we're making toward building a sustainable growth company. In addition, our results capped off a very good fiscal 2016 in which we delivered on our commitments. Today, I'll first provide a high-level overview of our fourth quarter results. But since it's the end of our fiscal year, we'd also like to provide a strategic update on the journey we've shared over the last three years. We'll focus on our revenue and financial drivers for the full-year, and provide some color on the behind-the-scenes progress we're making in research and development. Let's start with our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $726.8 million grew 3.4% on a reported basis or 3.8% in constant currency; a healthy performance despite a difficult comparison to the prior-year period. We also absorbed a headwind of nearly $4 million from divested and discontinued products. Net of these, total revenues would have grown 4.4% in constant currency. Our Surgical business again set the pace with its seventh straight quarter of double-digit growth globally. We are also pleased with how our breast imaging and molecular diagnostics businesses performed, and encouraged that new products began to contribute to growth. We'll come back to this point in a minute. In terms of geography, U.S. sales grew 7.4% in the quarter, continuing a string of strong results. Even if we exclude the $5 million royalty payment from our fourth quarter results, our growth rate accelerated on a sequential basis. As expected, international sales declined 9.6% as reported or 7.8% in constant currency, versus a difficult comparison in the prior-year period. Apart from this tough comp, international Breast Health was stable sequentially in the quarter. There were also some pockets of strength globally, namely molecular diagnostics and Surgical, both of which posted double-digit growth. Although these businesses are relatively small today outside the U.S., we believe they will be important growth drivers in 2017 and beyond. Profit margins remained robust in the quarter. Most importantly, non-GAAP net income grew 14.6%, more than three times faster than sales. And our net margin of 20.0% increased by 190 basis points. With the benefit of additional capital deployment, we posted non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 or 20.9% better than in the prior-year period. So all in all, we posted a very strong fourth quarter that exceeded expectations and capped off an excellent year. Thinking about the year as a whole, we made good progress in our journey from turnaround story to a sustainable growth company. To-date, our successes have been most visible in domestic sales execution, which in turn has driven the improved financial performance of the company. One of the first goals we established three years ago was to stabilize two highly-profitable products that had been declining sharply, ThinPrep and NovaSure. In 2016, these products were more than stable; they returned to solid growth. Cytology and perinatal sales increased 2.8% on the year in constant currency. Even more impressive, NovaSure sales grew 10% in constant currency, as our team capitalized on the market withdrawal of a competing product. As we stabilized ThinPrep and NovaSure, we also set out to maximize growth drivers such as our Genius 3D mammography systems and the Panther platform in molecular diagnostics. Both of these products performed well in 2016. Genius drove 5.2% constant currency growth in total Breast Health sales in 2016, and we remain bullish on the opportunity ahead of us. While there has been lots of debate about a peak in system placements, we have a fundamentally different and more positive view of the future. The 3D curve is very different than the 2D curve for a number of reasons, and we believe Breast Health sales will be stronger for longer than many anticipate. Although we've placed about 3,600 systems in the United States as of the end of the fiscal year, the market is still under-penetrated. For example, 3D installations represent a little more than 40% of total Hologic mammography systems. And if you look at MQSA statistics, 3D installations represent just a quarter of total systems. We have been placing roughly 300 units per quarter in the U.S. recently, and at this pace should enjoy many more quarters of solid performance. We are also gaining significant market share from our competitors, while our innovative marketing strategies enable us to maintain stable pricing. As our domestic installed base of 3D units has grown, so has the related service opportunity. Breast Health service revenue again exceeded $100 million in the quarter and increased at a high-single digit rate, boosting overall growth. This increase in service revenue, combined with the potential of new product, gives us confidence that Breast Health can continue to grow even as 3D adoption matures. Now let's turn to a second major growth driver, the Panther system, our fully-automated diagnostics instrument. Panther helped our molecular business grow 7.8% in constant currency in 2016, behind increased sales of women's health tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV, and trichomonas. By the end of fiscal 2016, we had shipped more than 1,000 Panther units just to diagnostic customers. And we're encouraged that a growing number of these placements are coming internationally. Panther shipments to customers outside the United States grew dramatically in 2016, and we believe we are just scratching the surface of this long-term opportunity. At the same time, our sales team is partnering with lab and physician customers to ensure that patients are tested according to the best clinical guidelines, providing better care while increasing organic volumes. In fact, on a global basis, the average Panther generated more than $190,000 in assay revenue in 2016, a high-single digit increase in utilization. And we are optimistic that this number will increase further as we roll out viral load assays in Europe and the United States. As we look back on fiscal 2016, the stabilization of ThinPrep and NovaSure, combined with strong growth from Genius and Panther, drove excellent full-year results. You might recall that 12 months ago, our initial guidance called for revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.84 billion for the year. We finished at $2.83 billion; so we delivered on our commitment. At the same time, we achieved significant margin improvement in 2016. For the year, non-GAAP gross margin was 65.6%, an impressive 140 basis points better than last year. This enabled us to make incremental investments in marketing and R&D to drive future growth, while still delivering operating income of 33.6%, 30 basis points better than in 2015. Combined with a lower tax rate and repurchases of both convertible debt and common shares, we posted non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.96 in 2016. This was 17.4% higher than in the prior year and comfortably ahead of our original guidance. Looking beyond earnings, we're also very pleased with our cash flow in 2016, which is often under-appreciated. We generated $787.2 million in operating cash, with only $94.5 million in CapEx. And roughly half of this CapEx went toward revenue-generating instruments such as our Panther systems. As a result, free cash flow for the year was $692.7 million, 23.3% higher than non-GAAP net income. Our operations and finance teams deserve tremendous credit for making this happen. As one measure of their success, inventories at year-end 2016 were $8.4 million less than a year ago, even though product revenues were about a $109 million higher. Taking a step further, inventories are now below the levels of even two years ago, demonstrating tremendous progress by our team. Obviously, these strong cash flows gave us the flexibility to continue improving our capital structure in 2016. We repurchased $274.2 million of convertible notes for $392.8 million during the year, as well as 7.3 million shares of common stock for $250 million. As a result, our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, has fallen to 2.8 times, a little more than half what it was at the time of the Gen-Probe acquisition. In addition, diluted shares outstanding were slightly lower in 2016 than in the prior year, providing a boost to EPS. Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to emphasize that strong cash flows also enabled us to invest appropriately and consistently in research and development, which increased about 8% this year. And we are just beginning to see the fruits of our labor. In the fourth quarter of 2016, sales of key new products exceeded $10 million in revenue for the first time. These new products include viral assays in Diagnostics, the Affirm prone biopsy system in Breast Health, and MyoSure REACH in Surgical. We recognize that $10 million is still small in the context of overall Hologic, but it's a good start and we are optimistic about the potential of these products in 2017. In addition, our R&D pipeline is building behind the first wave of new products. In Diagnostics, we recently filed for regulatory approval of our Aptima Hepatitis C viral load test in the United States, and anticipate launching it commercially in 2017, following the introduction of our HIV viral load assay. Sales of these products will become more meaningful in 2018, when we also have a Hepatitis B assay available. We also filed recently for U.S. regulatory approval of our herpes test, which will complement our existing portfolio of women's health products on the Panther system. And finally, we are beginning clinical trials for our respiratory assays on the next-generation Panther Fusion system. In Breast Health, we have fundamentally reshaped our R&D strategy away from the boom and bust approach of the past, toward a model that strives for continuous innovation built around our leadership position in 3D mammography. The Affirm prone biopsy system fits in this vein, as does our upcoming Brevera product, which will provide real-time specimen radiography to improve breast biopsy workflow and the patient experience. We are hopeful that Brevera will begin to contribute to growth late in 2017 and more meaningfully in 2018. Finally, in Surgical, we are encouraged by the early success of our MyoSure REACH line extension, which is providing new capabilities to customers and therefore helping expand the market. In the same way, we are working to leverage our market-leading position in endometrial ablation by launching internationally a next-generation NovaSure device that will improve patient comfort as well as physician usability. Compared to the dramatic improvement you've seen in U.S. sales execution, our progress in research and development is just becoming visible. We have a lot of work to do in these areas, but are excited about our early progress. In some ways, domestic sales execution represents the tip of the iceberg in terms of what's possible here. Below the surface, we are working diligently to boost new product innovation, build our international capabilities, and further enhance profitability. As our new leadership team settles in, and as talented, engaged employees at all levels of the organization continue to do their thing, we look forward to sharing more successes with you in 2017 and beyond. Now, I will hand the call over to Bob. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our divisional revenue performance, review the rest of our fourth-quarter financials, and then discuss our financial guidance for 2017. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary will focus on non-GAAP results, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency. We closed out our fiscal year with results that surpassed expectations. Revenue grew at a healthy rate, and favorable gross margins allowed us to reinvest opportunistically in the business, while still delivering strong bottom-line growth. I'll begin by discussing our Surgical division, which remained the growth leader in the quarter with sales of $101.5 million and growth of 17.6%. Fueling this growth was MyoSure, where sales of $42.6 million grew 33.4%, thanks to the outstanding efforts of our commercial team. In addition, NovaSure sales grew 8.7%, as we continued to gain market share and capitalize on a competitive withdrawal. Now moving to Diagnostics, we posted sales of $311.9 million in the quarter, a solid growth rate of 3.1%. In molecular diagnostics, quarterly sales of $134.3 million increased 9.6%. As Steve noted, we booked a $5 million royalty payment this quarter, but at the same time, we also absorbed a headwind of almost $3 million from our discontinued cystic fibrosis product line. So the underlying trends in the business remained strong, and we continue to gain share and increase utilization of women's health assays on the fully-automated Panther instrument. In addition, international sales grew at a mid-teens rate, and we posted yet another record quarter of Panther placements outside the U.S., providing a strong platform for future growth. Elsewhere in Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal products posted sales of $121 million and increased slightly compared to the prior-year period. Share gains for our ThinPrep product continue to offset headwinds from longer cervical cancer screening intervals. And finally, our blood business declined 6% as expected, as we continue to see the impact of lower blood utilization and fluctuating ordering patterns by our partner Grifols. Partially offsetting these headwinds were initial sales of our Zika products. As we enter 2017, we believe macro trends towards lower blood utilization will continue to be a drag on sales growth. Now moving to Breast Health, we posted global sales of $292.3 million and solid growth of 2.3% over another challenging comp. In the U.S, continued adoption of Genius 3D systems was supplemented by a growing service annuity and our sales of our new Affirm prone biopsy system, driving an increase of 7.2% in sales. Over the last two quarters, our U.S. Breast Health results have clearly illustrated a point we've made repeatedly in recent months, that the business can continue to grow despite increasingly challenging comps. And to round out our revenue discussion, Skeletal Health revenues of $21.2 million decreased 17.3% in constant currency, due mainly to lower volumes of our Fluoroscan mini C-arm products. Now moving down the income statement, fourth quarter gross margins of 65.7% increased 110 basis points compared to the prior-year period. Gross margins benefited from both geographic and product mix, as well as continued pricing discipline and operational improvements. Total operating expenses of $235.5 million increased 7.7% in the fourth quarter. We continue to take advantage of improving gross margins to reinvest strategically in the business. For example, quarterly R&D spending increased 16.3%, and we're beginning to see some of the benefits as Steve discussed. In addition, as we mentioned last quarter, a change in the retirement provisions of our equity plan drove an additional $4 million of expense. Despite these investments, our non-GAAP operating margin remained a healthy 33.3% in the quarter. Below the line, we continue to make good progress in two areas that have been a priority for our finance organizations. Based on lower debt levels, interest expense of $32.9 million in the fourth quarter declined 14.8%. At the same time, our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31% in the quarter was more than 300 basis points lower than a year ago. While we are very pleased with the results we've produced in a short amount of time, we are still at the beginning stages of this process and see continued opportunity ahead. And finally, to wrap up the fourth quarter income statement, non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 grew 20.9% compared to a year ago, much faster than sales growth. The multiple levers used to drive EPS growth in the quarter give us comfort in our ability to continue growing EPS at a multiple of sales. Now let me turn to cash flows and the balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $263.9 million improved 5.2%. We continue to focus on reducing our convertible debt. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $47.6 million in principal of our 2037 notes for $81.3 million, and intend to redeem the remaining $12 million in cash when the notes are callable this December. Despite retiring a portion of our convertible debt and repurchasing shares over the course of 2016, we ended the year with $548.4 million in cash, an increase of $57.1 million compared to the prior year. We finished the year with total debt of $3.3 billion, a reduction of $0.3 billion compared to the prior year. And our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, currently sits at 2.8 times, close to our target of 2.5 times. The combination of strong profit growth and lower debt continues to drive improvements to return on invested capital. As of year-end, ROIC was 12.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of a 180 basis points over the prior year. Now, I'd like to cover our non-GAAP financial guidance for fiscal 2017. We are forecasting mid-single digit revenue growth in 2017 on top of increasingly challenging comps. We expect an improving operating margin and lower tax rate to drive EPS growth at roughly double the rate of sales growth. Specifically, we anticipate constant currency revenue growth of between 4% and 5.5% in fiscal 2017. At recent exchange rates, this equates to sales of $2.94 billion to $2.98 billion on a reported basis, with reported growth rates between 3.8% and 5.2%. As you update your forecasts, we would encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance ranges at this early stage, as we've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Our guidance includes the net benefit of three extra selling days based on our fiscal calendar. Compared to the prior-year periods, we will gain four selling days in the first quarter. Although this will be the historically slow week between Christmas and New Years, while we will lose one day in the fourth fiscal quarter. We estimate this benefit to be between 50 and 70 basis points of sales growth, with a negligible effect on EPS. At the same time, our guidance also includes a roughly $5 million headwind from products that we have either divested or recently decided to discontinue. In other words, our guidance would have been about 20 basis points higher if these products remained in our portfolio. In terms of divisional growth for 2017, our guidance contemplates low- to mid-single digit growth in Diagnostics and Skeletal, mid-single digit growth in Breast Health, and slightly higher growth in Surgical. In Diagnostics, molecular should lead the charge behind Panther and an expanded international menu including virology assays. We forecast that cytology and perinatal sales will be flat to up slightly and we also expect blood to be flat to up slightly, as new Zika sales offset negative macro trends. In Breast Health, we expect continued strength in Genius 3D mammography, a growing service annuity, contributions from new products including the Affirm prone biopsy system and Brevera towards the end of the year, as well as a return to growth for our international business. In Surgical, we expect growth to be driven by MyoSure market expansion efforts and NovaSure share gains, as well as international sales. Geographically, we expect our international business to begin contributing to growth in fiscal 2017, in line with the company's overall growth rate. In terms of profitability, we forecast continued improvement in non-GAAP operating margin in 2017, but how we get there will be different than last year. In 2017, we forecast a slight improvement in non-GAAP gross margin percentage, combined with greater leverage from operating expenses, leading to more improvement in operating margin than we saw last year. All this leads us to forecast that earnings per share will be between $2.12 and $2.16 in 2017. This represents growth of 8.5% to 10.6% in constant currency and reported growth of between 8.2% and 10.2%. Again, we'd encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance range at this early stage of the year. This guidance assumes a full-year tax rate of approximately 31% and diluted shares outstanding of between 289 million and 291 million for the year. Our guidance does not assume any capital deployment beyond calling what's left of our 2037 convertible notes in December. Now let's cover guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect revenues of $720 million to $730 million, flattish on a sequential basis, as the benefit from extra selling days between Christmas and New Year's is offset by the normal seasonal decline we experienced due to our global sales meeting and the RSNA Conference in Breast Health. Compared to the prior-year period, this range reflects revenue growth of 3.8% to 5.2% on a constant currency basis and reported revenue growth of 3.6% to 5.0%. We forecast non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.51 in the first quarter. This represents anticipated growth of 9.1% to 11.3% in constant currency terms, or 8.7% to 10.9% on a reported basis. Compared to our fourth quarter actuals, please note that operating expenses will increase in the first quarter due to the timing of sales and marketing activities and the extra days. Before we open up the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that our fourth quarter capped off another good year for the company. Our financial performance demonstrates that we are transforming from a turnaround story to a sustainable growth company. We feel confident about the foundation we have established heading into 2017, and have the levers necessary to deliver mid-single digit revenue growth with EPS growth roughly double that rate. With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up and then return to the queue. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Our first question is from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for the good written guide. I have enough to worry about tonight like breaking that 108-year curse in a couple of hours, so I appreciate that. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: You're in first here, so you can get ready to focus on, Brian. Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: I appreciate that. Thank you very much. So, as we look at your guidance range, you had clearly signaled ahead of time that you were going to give a wider range and you certainly did that. I'm curious, you guided us to the midpoint but not on the high-end of the line there, is that really a function of kind of how you expect new products to contribute? You talked about $10 million from that this quarter and what not. But do you expect that new products are really the differentiating factor between that high-end to low-end and any color on that would be helpful. Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, Brian. The new products will certainly be a piece of it. I think we've all been around long enough to know no matter what we put into our forecast, it always comes out a little differently. And I just think it's a very prudent thing given particularly the environment to have a slightly broader range. I do think we see a little more \u2013 if the new products are doing well, which we fully expect they will, I think it clearly pushes us towards that higher end. I think we get into that 5%-ish range as things take off. We always want to be a little cautious until we start to see the success. I will tell you, I think Affirm is off to a very nice start. MyoSure REACH off to a very nice start. And these are really the first new products we've launched since we've come on. And also our international molecular diagnostics business is really starting to take off. We had a couple of quarters there of double-digit growth as well. So, there's a lot we feel good about, but again, still very early stages and a lot to play out. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, I think the other thing, Brian, just to build on that is some of these products haven't gotten full approval yet as well. And so there is an estimate of timing to start with, but we certainly feel very good about our path there, but there is some flexibility there as well. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: And you mentioned OUS, specifically in molecular diagnostics. And I think you talked about a return to growth next year somewhere in, I think, maybe mid-single digits or something overall. But can you talk about some of the things more specifically OUS that you guys are focused on, some of the other products that you guys are focused on next year that potentially could add to growth there? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, I think there's couple of things we're excited about for international. First is the leadership team there Eric Compton has really put in place. As we exit this year, we basically got a completely new leadership team internationally from how we entered the year, other than our leader of the Diagnostics business in Europe, who is already showing and really been leading the way with great growth. But I think as we look to international, the molecular diagnostics business ought to be a real standout for us. I think Surgical continuing off of a smaller base, but continuing to show good growth, and Breast Health will return to some growth, as we're working a lot tighter with our dealers and getting things in place there. So I think we feel incrementally significantly better entering this year than we did at this time last year about international. Operator : Our next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Steve, want to actually focus on margins. Guidance assumes some nice operating margin expansion. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers? I know you've over-invested during the growth boom, so can you maybe talk about some of the levers you can pull for margin expansion in 2017? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, we've clearly invested heavily, Tycho, especially on the marketing and the R&D fronts as this year was coming in well and obviously way hot on the EPS line. We've really \u2013 I would say those, we had expanded and invested more than our rate of sales, we'll probably come back into those being slightly leveragable relative to the rate of sales as we go into the current year. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then, as we think about Breast Health, Cigna was obviously the first to move forward with reimbursing Tomo for routine screening. Can you talk a little bit about how that's progressed and where you see other payors along that path? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, we really applaud Cigna. They obviously got on board. I would tell you it's a struggle with both Aetna and United at this point. We're working through it. We would love them to take the same approach towards their patients that Cigna did, but we're working through with them. And we basically have not assumed that they come and that could be an additional source of upside if or when they fall during the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great, thanks and good afternoon everybody. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Bill. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Couple of questions on virals, guys. Obviously, glad to hear that everything is on track for the U.S. launches. And if we're doing the math right, I think you should be accretive to the overall Diagnostic gross margins. But, that said, we've also heard about some pricing pressure over in Europe. And so can you help just kind of set the stage for us about what you expect in U.S.? And then maybe just a couple words on what you're seeing in Europe thus far. Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. To be clear, the virals will be a very small contributor in 2017 in the United States. And that's where they're going to be coming at a much better margin. So right now they are contributing to the top line growth, and certainly top- and bottom-line in Europe, but the big pickup for us will really be more in 2018 on the margin side, as it relates to the virals. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, and I think in Europe we're seeing good traction there, Bill. We talked about the Panther placements. 2016 was a very good year in Panther placements, specifically in Europe, but also internationally, in general. I think that's largely on the back of our viral system, our viral load assays. And we'll get the full benefit of that in 2017 as those instruments that were placed get a full year. The other thing is in that we noted that the revenue pull-through per Panther has increased. That's both in the U.S. as well as internationally. So I think that that's a harbinger for good growth going forward. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: And just the overall pricing dynamic in Europe? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, pricing is lower in Europe, but it's pretty much as expected based on our models. It's a little lower outside the U.S. than in the U.S., but not anything different than what we had anticipated. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Got it, very good. Thanks, guys. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Bill. Operator : Next we have Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Vijay. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : I feel like we were all waiting with bated breath and just given what's happened MedTech, we're glad to see this come through. Just maybe one on the guidance on the revenue, what does the guidance assume for OUS growth, international growth for next year? Because I would have thought, just given what happened sequentially 3Q versus 4Q international trends, any color on international would be helpful. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, it basically is in line with the total company growth rate next year. So I'd say we're picturing actually balanced growth for the first time. The last couple of years, it's been way skewed to the U.S., has been generating most of the growth. But I think we see this year really being a rebalancing (37:13). Recall the fourth \u2013 the current quarter is not indicative of a trend, given that last year's fourth quarter turns out \u2013 there was a lot more put into that last year's fourth quarter than we fully understood, just as dealers bought in to maintain their contracts against minimums and things like that. So, I think, again, we feel far better coming into this year and seeing expected growth. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : Great. And then maybe one for \u2013 go ahead, Bob. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, I was just was going to say the other thing to bear in mind there is, we had mentioned that the blood screening business will be roughly flat to slightly up year-on-year. That was a big headwind internationally through all of 2016 as the inventories and ordering patterns of our partner were adjusting. So we expect to kind of lap that. So that gives us help for turning that trajectory around as well. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : And then maybe one for you, Bob. You did mention that the guidance doesn't assume anything on the capital deployment front. I mean just I think in your prepared remarks, you also highlighted free cash generation, right? I guess my question is what's the focus for cap deployment over the next 12 months? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, we continued to focus on \u2013 we mentioned that in December we plan to call the first tranche of the remaining amount of that first tranche of convertible notes. I think outside of that, we continue to be focused on debt paydown as well as growth in M&A activities, and then finally share repurchase. The latter of those two is hard to predict, and certainly the convertible notes, we've don't those ability to actually call those formally until 2018. And so that's why we've done it. But we will be opportunistic as appropriate within the market. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Again, just to clarify, that would be fiscal 2018. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: That's correct. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: December of 2017. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: That's correct. Thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys and thank you for taking my question. I guess, I have one question on just assumptions you're baking into guidance. It has a few parts to it. So I'll rattle through these and then I'll get back in the queue. The first part is, for new products, it seems like you might be assuming that new products contribute about 100 basis points to fiscal 2017 growth at the midpoint of guide. Is that about right? Secondly, what's your view on the sustainability of NovaSure growth, given the benefit from competitive disruptions will annualize over the course of this fiscal year? Third, are there any major blood bank tenders that come up this year that we should be contemplating in our models? And lastly, how do you expect Panther utilization to increase above the $190,000 annualized figure that you provided in fiscal 2017 based on geographic and menu expansion? Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Doug, are you sure you don't want to throw a few more on that. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, I know. One question with 74 parts. Hey, Doug, this is Bob. I'll take the first on the new products. We feel very good about that. We mentioned the $10 million in Q4. We obviously expect that to grow throughout the course of 2017. And I think you had mentioned a 100 basis point, that's probably at the low end, maybe it's a little higher than that, maybe a 105 basis point maybe at the midpoint to think about that, and that's really driven behind the Affirm and Zika. Those are probably the two largest new products. Brevera will happen, but it's in the back-half of the year, and then certainly some of the virals and so forth in the U.S. will play a role, but again, the majority of that will happen in the 2018. So that's the first question. And I think sustainability of NovaSure, we feel very good about that. But remember the formal withdrawal of the competitive product happened in our second quarter, so we expect to have larger and better growth in first and second quarters than we went out in the back-half the year. We expect growth throughout the course of the year, but the first and second quarters will be bigger than the back-half for NovaSure. In terms of the major blood banks, you need to ask Grifols, those are their customers, and so we're not going to be able to be in a position to answer to that. And then in terms of Panther utilization, we do expect, that's one of the big areas that we're focused on, that's continuing to not only place Panther systems, but increase the utilization of the installed base. So I do expect that utilization to grow in line with the forecast that we had talked about for our molecular business. Thank you, Doug. Great. Operator : Next up, we have Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Isaac. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. So, just want to spend a minute talking about innovation. You guys have clearly done a great job restoring consistency in the core business, but maybe a little bit less appreciated has been some of the new products you put out there, both the ones you mentioned and maybe some of the ones you haven't talked about. And so, if I look at the R&D spend here, it's up a good amount year-over-year, and just thinking a little bit about how to frame the way you guys are investing your R&D dollars going forward. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about thematically where you think your best bang for your buck is invested? And as we look over a multiyear period, how should we think about investment across the various divisions? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, I think if you take a macro view at it, Isaac, we've dramatically overhauled really the R&D organizations at all three businesses and really proud \u2013 it's taken some work and it's all been happening behind the scenes, but really trying to break that grand slam or the boom bust ideas. So what we've got going on now is a lot of folks focused on both substantial innovation, but also incremental innovation. And if you take our Surgical business as an example, we had launched NovaSure and launched MyoSure and never really did any product upgrades or anything through the years, just threw them out there and then watched eventually price degrade or whatever else. So, launching MyoSure REACH is a classic example of something that we're working on. We also just mentioned, we're actually launching an upgraded NovaSure product outside the United States. You can imagine, we'll be planning on bringing that to the United States once we get that through approval. Likewise in Breast Health, instead of just focusing on the replacement for 3D Tomo, saying okay what are we going to do in the meantime and how can we leverage 3D? Well, the Affirm prone biopsy system, Brevera, there will be other things that we're looking at in that vein as well. And again, we wanted to put some points on the board before we start talking about the future, just as you know us stylistically. And then the same as it relates effectively the Diagnostics business, there were things that aren't really in play when we got here. Turbo charged the Fusion, the development of the Fusion platform, which is then opening up that ability to do the same kind of singles and doubles as it relates to future assays and be able to broaden out the menu there. And again, those will be a lot of singles and doubles that will come behind the viral load programs. And we really hunkered down early on to push the viral loads through and across the finish line. Those have kind of been up and down, on and off, and we've really put a sustained commitment and started to feel very, very good about our ability in each of the divisions to be bringing a more steady stream of innovation. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Isaac, this is Bob. Just to build on what Steve's saying. Steve talks a lot about people make a difference. And so over the last several years, we've really not only focused on rebuilding the commercial teams, but also the R&D teams. And so when I think about the R&D spend, we spend roughly 8% any quarter, it can change. That's probably the right amount. But I think right now what we've done is fundamentally, as Steve mentioned, change the mindset of the organizations and how they're going about actually developing products, linking R&D with marketing, truly having insight-driven innovation and creating that competitive advantage. We spend most money as a percent of sales in our Diagnostics business, less in Breast and our Surgical businesses. I think that is probably going to stay roughly the same, but it's really the makeup of it and the leadership making a big difference in terms of how we evaluate the innovation pipeline. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's really helpful color, thanks. And maybe just a follow-up for Bob on the financial side of the guidance. Can you talk a little bit about tax planning, maybe what's baked into your guidance this year for tax rate? And are there any opportunities that could translate to a lower tax rate that moves the needle this fiscal year or is it maybe still a longer term thing? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, I think it's still a longer-term thing, Isaac. If you recall, we didn't anticipate anything actually really starting to happen until 2017 and we were actually able to pull some things forward into 2016. So you saw one of the benefits in 2016 as being having a lower tax rate relative to 2015. And so with that, we still see that kind of steady improvement, but we have actually accelerated some of those efforts, resulted in the lower tax rate in 2016. Longer term, we continue to evaluate kind of what that looks like. We're roughly on that point per year, I think that that's probably a reasonable way to model going forward, which in this 31% that we're talking about really is roughly a point better than where we were for the full-year 2016. So that's the way I would think about it. Isaac. Operator : Thank you. And next, we have David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, David. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. How are you doing? So couple of quick ones here. First, for Bob and then I've got \u2013 two for Bob and one for Steve. That'll be fast, I promise. So, Bob, just coming back to international for a second here, if you do the math, you go sort of from mid-single digit declines to mid-single digit growth, where you pick up 10 points of relative on 20% of your business. It's two points of growth. So it's a key driver of the improvement in 2017. Your comp adjusted growth for international though in the fourth quarter actually got worse. So just can you just help us understand why fourth quarter actually slowed comp adjusted, but you're confident you get that reacceleration in 2017? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, if you look at the kind of trends of the business on a sequential basis, that's where we feel confident. We knew that we had kind of an outsized number in Q4 of last year, which resulted in your comp-adjusted numbers looking worse. But when we look at the fundamentals of the business and some of those pockets, things like molecular, Surgical, the trend in the stabilization of our Breast Health business, which is probably is the biggest \u2013 one of biggest changes and then certainly we feel pretty clear about \u2013 we have pretty decent line of sight into the inventory levels now with the blood screening business. I think those are kind of the building blocks that were headwinds last year, that certainly will be our tailwinds going into 2017. I think, Eric, as Steve mentioned, has done a tremendous job of really focusing the teams on the fundamentals. We've gone to the regional basis. We've brought in a bunch of new leaders there and I think they're just starting to get a hold on things. But I think we've seen good progress and good momentum going into 2017 on those couple of barriers. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, and then an unfun question for you and a fun question for Steve. Stock-based compensation FASB changes, any impact on your earnings for 2017? And then for Steve, fiscal 2017 guidance is in line, I think positive, but I think the enthusiasm for Hologic post our conference since September really wasn't about 2017, it was about sort of the view that this business can deliver not just one year of 5% and 10% growth, frankly, but several years of 5% and 10% growth. So I wonder if you could just sort of synthesize for shareholders what are some of those business dynamics you're seeing that give you that confidence that this isn't just one good year, but it's a few good years to come, and I'll jump back into queue. Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, the stock-based comp piece, there's no impact. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: No material impact. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: And I think, David, each year when on a look out, I'm always far more worried about the year further out just as I was probably more worried about 2017 earlier in 2016. And every year, what I keep seeing is our teams just keep putting more new products in place, better people in place, and I probably feel better about the sustainability of this company at any point since I've been here. Because I think by the time we go into 2018, we're going to have more products hitting. We're going to have the international business that much further along. There's so much of what Eric's focused here during this year. What we've been doing in international this year is really putting the foundation in place that I hoped and wanted to be putting in place sooner, but we really weren't doing it. So I think just fundamentally, we just keep getting stronger and stronger. The comps will be getting tougher this and that, but overall, feeling very good. We're going to have a lot of stuff hitting in late 2017 and into 2018, and that's one of the pipeline stuff will really be coming through. Operator : Our next question is from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, and good afternoon. Maybe one on molecular and an update on Breast Health, OUS specifically. I'm just wondering what the capital utilization rate of Panther is at $190,000? So just kind of looking ahead, and maybe where that could actually go, longer-term not only for 2017? And then on Breast Health, I guess the question really is, Bob, going back in \u2013 I don't know, some meetings, you did speak about the 2D opportunity OUS as being pretty substantial over the next several years. So I'm just wondering if we can get an update on that opportunity specifically. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. So on the molecular utilization at the $190,000, I think we had talked about previously, call it roughly 30%, it's probably a little higher than that now, maybe a third of the capacity and now, which means that there's still plenty of opportunity to grow utilization on the instrumentation. It's never going to get to a 100%, but certainly, we have room to grow. And if we look at Tigris as an example, it's up in the 65% to 75% range in those utilization. So there's still plenty of opportunity there from a molecular standpoint. In regards to Breast Health, yeah, we are still enthusiastic about the opportunities both in 3D as well as 2D. I think the team has been focused and really looked at country by country, screening guidelines. How we work with not only our dealers, but also starting, more importantly, with governments and so forth and meeting some of the governments where they are. And the beauty of our 2D system is its software upgradeable to 3D. And so we have both the best 2D system as well as the best 3D system. And so that is still a strategy that we feel good about in the markets that we're focused on and an opportunity not only to place both 2D and 3D systems, but have that opportunity for upgrade over time. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC : That's helpful. Just a follow up there would be, is 50% to 60% the goal for Panther in terms of capacity utilization and is there a round number for OUS mammography units that is the target? Thanks. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: I don't know if we have a specific goal. It's really on how confident and comfortable the lab is. At some stage, they're going to want a second Panther as a backup. So rather than focus on a capacity goal, what I would focus on really is we have plenty of opportunity to continue to grow utilization of our assays and our upcoming assays in the pipeline on the existing Panther. Operator : Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks and congrats on the nice quarter. I wanted to follow up there on Panther. Just was wondering if you could give any updated thoughts the individual sexual health products, how they performed in the quarter. And then, as time goes on, have you seen more cross-selling of the individual products? Maybe just as you look at the labs, how many are using one test or two tests or all three with trich? Any color would be great. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, maybe I'll talk to the last question first. That's one of the reasons that the utilization is growing the way it is, is the team, in particular in the U.S., has done a fantastic job of being able to sell the entire menu, and really done a customer segmentation that says, okay, if they've got chlamydia, gonorrhea, are they testing for trich? Are they testing for HPV? And that has really driven that utilization in the U.S., and it's starting to drive that utilization internationally as well, now that we have the viral loads. I will tell you in terms of growth rates for our major assays, still obviously the largest is our chlamydia, gonorrhea, CTGC assay that grew in the low-single digits. And then HPV and trich continue to grow in excess of market. So those are gaining share. We feel good about our ability to continue to drive growth in 2017 in those markets, as well or those assays. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And one more follow-up on Panther. Just in international with the success you've had with viral load, is there a sense that you can say these customers now, a certain percentage are using viral load? And I guess what I'm trying to get to is obviously with the strength of the U.S. fleet, if there's a way that we can think about the commercial strategy here and what percentage we can think would adopt the test over time? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, so we're still in the early days of the viral loads. We just now \u2013 we launched those maybe \u2013 they had the full complement six, nine months ago, obviously with the tender-based contracts in Europe. It takes some time. I think the good news is the leading indicator of that, which is the Panther placements, is happening, but it's probably a number that we expect to grow into 2017 and 2018 for sure, but it's still early days. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. And I'll try to ask two relatively quick ones. So, Bob, the first one, I think the guidance implies about 100 bps of Op margin expansion, and you mentioned somewhat shared between OpEx and gross margin expansion. So that leaves about 50 bps for gross margin, down from roughly 140 bps this year. And I certainly understand the headwinds by international growing faster in 2017 relative to 2016, but still a decent stepdown. So, can you just talk to us about that stepdown in gross margin expansion? And then are you still getting a good gross margin pull from your three major divisions? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, so certainly, we've got margins that are \u2013 we finished FY 2016 at almost 66% gross margin. That's nothing to be ashamed about. We feel good about that. . Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: I'd rephrase it, that we're still continuing to expand as opposed to a stepdown from (57:53). Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And the international business certainly is a lower-margin business, which is going to impact some of that. And then certainly in 2016, we benefited from Surgical being outsized growth. We still expect growth in our Surgical business, but not at the level that it had in 2016. So there's some product mix in there as well. I will tell you that our operations teams are incredibly focused on continuing to improve the operational aspects of their business and we've established good pricing discipline. And I think there's still opportunities to improve margins; I think just perhaps not at the level of 2016, given some of that product mix that with had. And then in the OpEx margins, it's going to be across the product lines or product areas. As Steve mentioned, we opportunistically look to invest in places like marketing and some of the other areas. We have the ability to kind of to move some of those levers as we need to. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, perfect, very helpful. And then just, Steve, maybe you. Just longer term on that Surgical division, is the right way to think about NovaSure sort of flattish once you cycle through ThermaChoice? And maybe more importantly, just to take a step back, if you could opine upon MyoSure. I mean, rarely do you have 30% sustainable growth and now to the point where you've got a product annualizing at over $150 million. So just maybe talk about the sustainability of why you're seeing that sort of growth rate and just the market opportunity that you see in front of Hologic for that product. Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. I would say MyoSure has been probably our wonderful continued surprise that it's been able to generate, as you just said, two straight years of 30%-plus growth after a year in which it had looked to be slowing in the 20%-ish range, kind of really reaccelerated. We're not sure how high is up yet there. And I almost don't want to call the market, because I think we're finding more and more avenues and more and more opportunities to tap into other procedures and things. So we continue \u2013 even through the year, that growth rate has not yet slowed. We brought some news to it. And I think we see that as still being a real growth driver for us. NovaSure will clearly come back to earth in terms of growth rates. But again, we're going to be bringing news to that franchise and we've adopted a mindset that we don't accept anything but an expectation of growth, even on older businesses and it's our job to figure out how to grow them. I am confident that team will continue to find ways to keep growing what is a great, great product. But certainly at slower rates, probably, once we get through the big competitive piece. Operator : Next we have from UBS, Jon Groberg. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thanks. I'll actually just ask one question. Steve, the capital deployment that was brought up earlier, can you maybe just talk about where you're at in terms of your team's ability to do more M&A? Whether or not you would be disappointed if you didn't do something from an M&A standpoint in 2017? I mean, it seems like where you're at as a firm, you seem to have a little bit more confidence internationally. Obviously, the core business in the U.S. is doing well, the M&A piece hasn't really kicked in yet. Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, Jon. I would expect we'll likely do something in 2017. It might be very small. It might be more mid-size, not really sure yet. I think our still relentless focus has been always on keeping the base business growing at a healthy rate. And then I do think there may be come some opportunities. I would tell you, we'd looked at a lot of things, some of which we're patient on and we want to make sure that they make sense. So, I'm seeing a lot more. I would say, if you look at my percentage of my time spent with the divisions on business development deals today versus a year ago, it's a dramatic difference. And we're seeing a lot of good things and a lot of things that may not be making the full hurdle, because we're obviously being very disciplined as we go. But I do feel good that we're going to continue to be smart and sensible in the capabilities, have come a long way. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Operator, I think we have time for one more question and then we'll wrap it up. Operator : Our final question is from Mary Kate Gorman from Canaccord Genuity. Mary Kate A. Gorman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi, Mary Kate on for Mark Massaro. Thanks for taking my question. You know, I was hoping to ask, have you begun to see more favorable reimbursement decisions in 3 Tomo as a result of the updated NCCN guidelines similar to Cigna? And along that line, do you anticipate new payors coming on next quarter as a result of payors revising coverage decisions in the new year? Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Thanks, Mary Kate. We're certainly using the NCCN guidelines and the additional clinical data to try to drive additional private pay. I would not expect anything necessarily in the next quarter. Hopefully in the coming quarters, we would hope to continue to make progress there. But there's a lot of prickliness. Frankly, there's a lot going not private pay world right now, and this isn't necessarily getting the full attention that we think it should. But we'll continue to drive that and expect that over time we'll knock those barriers down. But I think all of that would be additional upside. Mary Kate A. Gorman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great, thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Okay, operator, I think that wraps us up. Operator : Okay. Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. Have a good evening.",

Good afternoon and welcome to the Hologic Inc., First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Conference. My name is Callianna and I'll be your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. And all lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Watts : Thank you, Callianna. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today, then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our Web site. We also will post our prepared remarks to our Web site shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived on our Web site through February 24. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings release. Finally, unless otherwise noted, all percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Steve MacMillan : Thank you Mike, and good afternoon everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We posted solid results. Both revenue and earnings per share exceeded our guidance, illustrating the progress we're making on our journey from turnaround story to sustainable growth company. As we discussed at the recent JP Morgan conference, the success of our turnaround to-date has been based largely on improved execution by our U.S. commercial teams. They stabilized market-leading products that were once in decline, and optimized the potential of innovative growth drivers. Both of these trends continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. But at the same time, we are beginning to see the next chapter of our growth story emerge this quarter in two important areas. First, our efforts to revitalize our research and development pipeline are beginning to bear fruit, as new products contributed progressively more to growth. And second, we generated growth internationally after four consecutive quarters of declines in fiscal 2016. While we realize we still have much work to do outside the United States, we are encouraged by the progress we are making and the foundations we are building. As we look toward the future, new products and international growth will play an increasingly important role in our success. And we expect a third area, business development, to contribute as well. In this regard, the divestiture of our blood screening business, which closed yesterday, will increase our financial flexibility as we seek growth through acquisitions and other capital deployment activities. With that introduction out of the way, we'd like to provide an overview of our first quarter revenue results, highlighting both established growth drivers and the early contributions from new products and international. Then I'll review the blood screening sale briefly before handing the call over to Bob. Let's start with our first quarter results. Revenue of $734.4 million grew 5.6% on a reported basis, or 6.3% in constant currency. We posted good growth over and above our most difficult comparison from the prior year. As a reminder, sales in last year's first quarter grew a strong 8.1% in constant currency. This quarter we also absorbed a headwind of roughly 50 basis points from discontinued products, mainly a cystic fibrosis test in molecular diagnostics. On the positive side, as discussed in our last quarterly call, we benefited from four extra selling days between Christmas and New Year's, which we estimate contributed roughly half our growth for the quarter. In terms of geography, U.S. sales grew a healthy 5.2% in the quarter, versus a very difficult comp from a year ago when sales increased 12.8%. This performance was a continuation of strong recent results, and once again validated the quality of both our products and our people. We are also encouraged that international sales grew 6.1% excluding blood screening. Growth was again led by our molecular diagnostics and surgical franchises, both of which grew faster than 20% in constant currency, and are beginning to show results from the foundations we have built over the last couple of years. While international sales clearly improved, we want to emphasize that it's only one quarter, and we are still very much a start-up outside the United States. But now we have our leadership team in place and are beginning to establish a strong basis for future growth. As a reminder, in the past 12 months we have hired four new commercial leaders for Latin America, Asia Pacific, Canada and Europe. Now let's turn to divisional performance in the first quarter. Surgical remained our growth leader, and posted its eighth straight quarter of double-digit growth globally. Let me emphasize that's two years of double-digit revenue growth -- not to mention high profitability -- from a division that many people thought we should sell three years ago. In the first quarter, which is seasonally strong for Surgical, sales were $114.8 million, an increase of 17.2%. MyoSure led the way by posting sales of $48.3 million and growth of 32.1%. We are achieving exceptional growth for MyoSure as our commercial teams continue to expand the market and capitalize on our new MyoSure Reach line extension. As a side note, MyoSure Reach was the biggest sales contributor in the basket of new products that we track regularly. Last quarter we said these products exceeded $10 million in quarterly sales for the first time, and this quarter they showed good growth on a sequential basis. NovaSure sales of $66.4 million grew 8.6%, as we continued to capture market share based on a competitive withdrawal. We should point out, however, that we have almost completely annualized this benefit, so NovaSure growth rates are expected to slow going forward, as we previously forecast. Before we leave Surgical, let me mention that we recently received FDA approval for our new NovaSure Advanced line extension. We are pleased that in GYN Surgical, like the rest of our divisions, R&D is becoming an integral part of our growth strategy. For example, over the last few quarters, we have been able to gain U.S. approval for two new products that will extend our leadership position in the field. Moving to Diagnostics, we posted sales of $325.4 million in the first quarter, and 5.5% growth. In molecular diagnostics, sales of $139.9 million grew 8.8% -- despite the discontinued products headwind-- based on share gains and increased utilization of women's health assays on the fully automated Panther instrument. Of note, international sales grew 25.8% as we continue to see the benefits of new leadership, record Panther placements, and increasing assay pull-through on those instruments. Specifically, revenue from our three viral load assays is increasing nicely in Europe, although admittedly off a small base. And in the United States this quarter, we were pleased to receive FDA approval of our first viral load assay, for HIV-1. This is a highly complex assay that required a prospective clinical trial and a Pre-Market Approval from the FDA, so the approval is a testament to the quality of our Diagnostics R&D and clinical teams. Building on the HIV approval, we hope to gain clearance for our hepatitis C test later this fiscal year, and our hepatitis B assay in 2018. Once we have all three viral assays approved in the U.S., we are optimistic that they will begin contributing to domestic revenue growth. Elsewhere in Diagnostics, blood screening sales of $65.2 million exceeded our expectations and grew 7.4%. Most of the upside came from initial sales to support investigational testing for the Zika virus, and from international ordering by our partner Grifols that rebounded from very low levels a year ago. Overall, blood screening sales declined in the United States, but increased significantly in international markets, so keep that in mind as you're analyzing the performance of our core businesses by geography. Finally, cytology and perinatal sales were $120.3 million in the quarter, with modest global growth of 1.1%, as domestic share gains by our ThinPrep liquid Pap test continued to offset headwinds from longer cervical cancer screening intervals. It's worth mentioning that while cytology products comprise more than 85% of this revenue line, the perinatal portion of the business has started to perform better as well. This will be an area to watch in the future as we revitalize our new product development efforts. Now let's move on to Breast Health, where global sales of $273.3 million grew 4.6%. Domestic placements of our innovative, market-leading Genius 3D mammography systems again increased modestly, and orders remain healthy. We continue to gain market share while maintaining price discipline, based on our superior product profile and strong customer relationships. And we still have significant conversion runway ahead of us, as less than 45% of our domestic installed base has upgraded to our Genius platform thus far. Importantly, other supplemental growth drivers have begun to emerge in Breast Health, as we very deliberately planned. Specifically, in the mammography segment, strong growth in service revenues from a growing installed base of Genius systems, combined with sales of our new Affirm prone biopsy system, drove a 5.5% increase in domestic sales. Outside the United States, Breast Health sales were basically flat, as we continue to work, on a country-by-country basis, to optimize our channel strategy and build our commercial capabilities. With each passing quarter we feel better about our prospects here. But as we have said before, it will take time to fully realize the considerable opportunity in front of us. To round out the revenue discussion, Skeletal Health revenues of $20.9 million decreased 10.7%. Although this is a small business for us, this performance is clearly unacceptable. As a result, we have refocused our commercial efforts, and are beginning to see an increase in DXA bookings that bodes well for improved performance later this year. Now let me shift gears and touch briefly on our blood screening divestiture, which closed yesterday. As a reminder, we sold our stake in our blood screening business to our former commercial partner, Grifols, for a purchase price of $1.85 billion in cash. Blood screening was a non-strategic business for us, as our partner managed sales and marketing, and we lacked the ability to control our own commercial destiny. We believe this deal makes Hologic a fundamentally stronger company in 2017 and beyond. We are receiving excellent value for our blood screening assets. The $1.85 billion purchase price represented a premium to our own, internal valuation on an after-tax basis, and is particularly attractive when you consider the underlying headwinds facing the blood screening market, both declining unit volumes and increased price competition. By monetizing the business today, we have significantly derisked our portfolio going forward. In addition, divesting the blood screening business removes a drag on our growth, which will enable us to increase both revenues and EPS at a faster rate. And as competitive pressures intensify, this benefit will likely increase over time. And finally, the deal markedly strengthens our balance sheet and increases our financial flexibility to grow through acquisitions. As mentioned earlier, we continue to believe that M&A -- as a supplement to internal innovation, commercial execution and international expansion-- will be an important part of our future growth strategy. Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me summarize by saying that Hologic is off to a good start in 2017. In the first quarter, our domestic commercial organization continued to drive growth of our market-leading products. At the same time, the next chapter of our growth story began to emerge, as new products and international started to contribute. As a result, both revenue and EPS exceeded our guidance. And we significantly increased our financial flexibility by divesting our blood screening business for an attractive price. Now I will turn the call over to Bob. Bob McMahon : Thank you Steve, and good afternoon everyone. I'm going to walk through the rest of our first quarter income statement, the balance sheet, and our updated financial guidance for 2017. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Steve described, our first quarter was a quarter of solid execution, and this began on the top line with revenue growing 6.3% in constant currency. In addition, non-GAAP EPS finished at $0.52, a reported increase of 13%, as we continue to show good leverage down to the bottom line of the income statement. Now, let's start by discussing how we accomplished this. Gross margins of 65.2% were flat compared to a year ago, as favorable product mix was offset by increasing international sales and the negative effects of a stronger U.S. dollar. Total operating expenses of $231.1 million increased 4.6% in the first quarter, mainly due to the extra days in our fiscal calendar and the timing of marketing expenses. As Steve mentioned, we are pleased with the returns that we are beginning to see from research and development, and expect to continue investing there to generate sustainable growth. Even while accommodating these investments, our operating margin of 33.7% improved by 30 basis points in the first quarter. Below the line, our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31% was 175 basis points lower than a year ago. And while we have no special insight into the prospects for corporate tax reform, we do believe we would benefit significantly from most of the changes being discussed in Washington. And to wrap up the discussion of the income statement, EPS of $0.52 grew 13% compared to a year ago, more than double the rate of sales and ahead of our guidance. Please note, we estimate that our blood screening business contributed $0.10 of EPS in the first quarter, flat versus the prior year period. You'll see that we included in our press release the historical contributions of blood screening to quarterly EPS, to help you with an apples-to-apples comparisons going forward. Now let's turn to cash flows and the balance sheet. In the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $269.1 million improved 6.8%. We continued efforts to reduce our convertible debt by calling what was left of our 2037 notes. Once the administrative procedures are complete, we will have eliminated from our balance sheet this most dilutive tranche of notes, which originally totaled $450 million in principal. And as you know, the remaining two tranches of our converts are callable in December of this year and March of 2018, just over a year from now. We continue to generate strong cash flows, with operating cash flows of $169.6 million in the quarter. We spent only $24.7 million on capital, leading to free cash flow of $144.9 million. And turning to the balance sheet, we closed out the quarter with $646 million in cash and $3.3 billion in total debt outstanding, resulting in $2.7 billion of net debt. This represents a reduction of $0.3 billion versus a year ago. And based on this, our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, stood at 2.6x at the end of the quarter, a much healthier level than just a few years ago. To wrap up the discussion of results, we have steadily improved our return on invested capital through consistent profit growth coupled with lower debt. At the end of our first quarter, ROIC was 13.1% on a trailing 12-month basis, a 180 basis point increase over the prior year. Now I'd like to shift gears and discuss our non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and the second quarter. We are updating our guidance based on our good first quarter results, the divestiture of our blood screening business, and the stronger U.S. dollar, which is affecting all multinational companies. With the divestiture and FX changes, it's important to understand that our expectations for our ongoing, base business are consistent with our initial constant currency guidance. We remain on track for a good year with mid-single-digit sales growth for our core business. Now, let's start with that updated revenue guidance for the full year 2017. Given the number of moving pieces, I'm going to take a minute to walk everyone from our previous guidance to our current guidance. As a reminder, we previously guided to reported sales of $2.94 billion to $2.98 billion, which represented constant currency growth of between 4% and 5.5%. As you know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened materially since we gave our initial guidance back in November. Given our relatively higher proportion of U.S. sales, currency represents less of a headwind for us than most of our peers. Nonetheless, based on recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency fluctuations are driving an incremental reduction of just over $20 million to our previous revenue guidance. This applies to our core business, excluding blood. Now let's fold in the much larger impact of the blood screening divestiture. Since the deal closed yesterday, at the end of January, we are essentially removing from our full-year forecast eight months of regular blood screening sales. But we do expect some trailing, low-margin revenue, mainly related to raw material and instrument supply that we will continue providing. We forecast this trailing revenue to total $15 million to $25 million for February through the remainder of the year. So taking into account our first quarter actuals and relative to our last blood screening revenue forecast of $240 million, the net impact of the divestiture is a revenue reduction of between $130 million and $140 million. Said another way, we now expect to record blood screening revenue of between $100 and $110 million this fiscal year, with the majority of it in the first and second quarters. Factoring in a few other minor adjustments, this leads to our new revenue guidance of $2.785 billion to $2.825 billion. Underlying this, our base business remains healthy. For example, if you were to exclude at the midpoint $105 million of blood screening sales from 2017, and also remove blood from last year's results, our new guidance would imply constant currency growth for our core business of between 4.2% and 5.8% on an apples-to-apples comparisons. Now, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect sales of between $675 million and $685 million. Again, this includes one month of regular blood screening sales, plus a portion of the trailing revenue related to raw material and instrument supply that I mentioned before. So in total, we expect blood screening to contribute between $25 million and $30 million to our second quarter reported results. To give you a sense of guidance for our underlying core business, if you were to back out $27 million of blood screening sales at the midpoint, and also remove blood screening revenue from last year, our quarterly guidance implies constant currency growth rates for our core business of between 3.6% and 5.3% on an apples-to-apples basis. As part of this, let me remind you that Surgical sales are somewhat seasonal, so we expect them to decline sequentially from our first quarter to our second quarter, like in prior years. Now let\u2019s move on to our revised EPS guidance. As a reminder, we previously guided to earnings per share between $2.12 and $2.16. Using the same logic as before, we are essentially removing eight months of regular blood screening EPS from our previous forecast. Then we add back a small amount of earnings from the $15 million to $25 million of trailing revenue that I mentioned. These sales will come in at lower-than-normal margins, so relative to our initial guidance, we forecast the net reduction in EPS from the blood screening divestiture will be about $0.21 for the full year in 2017. Factoring in a slight headwind from currency, we arrive at our new, non-GAAP EPS guidance of between $1.90 and $1.94, which includes roughly $0.13 related to blood screening. Again by way of illustration, if you were to back out blood screening EPS from this year's forecast and last year's results, our forecast implies reported EPS growth rates for our core business of between 11.3% and 13.8% on an apples-to-apples basis. Now, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect earnings per share of $0.45 to $0.46, which includes roughly $0.03 of regular earnings from our blood business that was just divested. Using the same methodology as before, this implies reported EPS growth rates for our core business of between 13.5% and 16.2% on an apples-to-apples basis. Our new guidance assumes a full-year tax rate of approximately 31%, and diluted shares outstanding of between 287 million and 289 million for the year. Our guidance does not assume any additional capital deployment, although we do intend to explore repurchasing some of our remaining convertible notes, and our common stock. We're not incorporating any potential benefit into our guidance for two reasons. First, the magnitude and timing depend on market and other conditions. And second, since we're already four months into the year, the 2017 impact is likely to be very small. As you update your forecasts, we would again encourage you to model around the middle of our guidance ranges. Not only have we incorporated both upsides and downsides into our forecast, we also have some added uncertainty around the trailing blood screening revenue. Now, before we open the call for questions, I'd like to conclude by saying that we are off to a good start in 2017. We began our fiscal year with quarterly revenues that exceeded expectations, encouraging results from key future growth drivers including new products and international, and earnings that grew at a multiple of sales. Finally, we completed a divestiture that strengthens our balance sheet while accelerating the company\u2019s growth rates. With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Dan Leonard : Hello. Thank you. So, first off, I'm curious. If you can comment on whether or not your M&A pipeline has built since you announced the blood divestiture. Steve MacMillan : We've had a lot more calls from bankers, but I would say we are pursuing the same plan. We've got a lot more people that we meet with -- at various conferences. But, at the end of the day Dan, we are keeping very focused, very disciplined and going about things to see where we've always been. Dan Leonard : Okay. Thank you for that. And not an entirely related follow-up, but can you comment on as it relates to your order book for Tomo, may be any thoughts on the hospital capital spending environment and whether any of your customers have shown any more uncertainty given all the changes, potential ACA and what we have here? Steve MacMillan : Sure, Dan. We continue to be in very close touch with our sales folks around, are they sensing anything changes in the environment, we are not hearing much or anything. And I will tell you, I think we continue to feel very good about the bookings that are still coming in on the business. So, that can always change. But, nothing at all at this point. Operator : We will hear next from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about the molecular franchise maybe start with sexual health and just anything worth pointing out in terms of the trends with some of the protest you have there? Steve MacMillan : Yes. I think at a high level when you see the 8.8% global growth in molecular, we continue to feel very good both domestically and really internationally and a lot of that is -- frankly, it's all the core business. It's the women's health assays. Internationally the virals are starting to contribute Jack, but there is still a very small and we've got a few ancillary assays here and there. But, for the most part, it is our core women's health assays driving the growth. Bob McMahon : Yes. I think Jack just add to that. If I look at the core assays that we have both on a domestic and global basis, I would say we grew faster than market. We gained share and the three key assays that we have and we are already looking for number one share in CTGC, HPV and [indiscernible]. And I think we continue to feel very good about continued piece of our Panther placements as well. So, I think that bodes well for the future. Jack Meehan : Great. That's helpful. And then, just want to follow-up Bob on the share repurchase, I was surprised that just with the upcoming proceeds from blood screening that you weren't a little bit more active in the quarter, you thought about putting it to work. Just your philosophy there and any update thoughts, would be great? Thanks. Bob McMahon : First, obviously with that, we weren't able to even if we wanted to because we were in blackout for the large majority of the time. But, that being said, I think our priorities continue to be Jack that we want to clean up the balance sheet. We talked about the converts, we have taken now the first tranche in those converts by doing that it also helps with the dilution. So we will continue to look at that and then also be very disciplined that's around M&A and growth and augmenting our R&D activities and be opportunistic with the share repurchase. And that's kind of the order of priority. So, we are looking at all of those levers throughout the course of the year, timing is always difficult to predict on those things. But, rest assure that we plan to utilize those capital -- those proceeds in a various ways. Operator : We will hear now from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Bill Quirk : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Steve MacMillan : Hey, Bill. Bob McMahon : Hey, Bill. Bill Quirk : So, I guess the first question is on [NovaSeek] [ph] kind of continues to surprise the upside despite kind of lapping some of the competitive dynamics. Can you just talk maybe a little bit about what's your expectations are for, I guess surgical broadly and [NovaSeek] [ph] in particular here as we think about 2017? Steve MacMillan : Sure, Bill. I think we have been very pleased with what our team had already done by stopping the declines of NovaSure and trying to get into a modest growth business before the competitive withdrawal. We have clearly benefited for the last almost four quarters from a competitive withdraw that's inflated those growth rates. But, we still think it can be a growth business. And MyoSure as well continues to probably defy a lot of expectation. So, we continue to be very, very encouraged by what this business can do. Now, after eight straight quarters of double-digit growth, certainly that the comps and the stacked comps and everything else continue to get tougher and tougher. But, we feel good about where the business is going and good about the international opportunity and good about the fact that we are just launching NovaSure Advance that will bring some new life into the franchise. Having said all of that, we are clearly assuming a return to single-digit growth here as we go into the second half of the year and probably a more modest growth rate from what we have been able to achieve. Bob McMahon : I was going to say Bill if you -- if you recall the competitive product was first recalled at the end of the -- our fiscal first quarter and then was permanently taken off the market in our second quarter. So we would expect Q3 and Q4 to be at a more normalized growth rate to Steve's point. Bill Quirk : Okay. Got it. I appreciate the color on NovaSure, no question. And then, just secondly for me, I guess thinking a little longer range, it's more of a housekeeping question, I guess. That the raw material supply going to Grifols that's not a one time or a one year phenomenon, all right? That's presumably something that should continue albeit at low margins in 2018 and beyond. Thanks. Bob McMahon : Yes, Bill. That's right. I mean, it's a combination of a couple of things. Probably the biggest piece is actually the Panther systems. And the spare parts associated with those, so we will continue to be a partner there for a period of time as well as that raw material that we just talked about. But, that is a -- we would expect that to continue on into beyond 2017 for a period of time, yes. Operator : And from Evercore ISI, we will hear from Vijay Kumar. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter. Steve MacMillan : Hey, thanks Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Steve maybe going back to that M&A question on -- if I think about -- you have the proceeds, right? If you think about pause the uncertainty whether it's from water tax or from a corporate tax reform, is that an impediment or hurdle when you think about available asset? Steve MacMillan : Not really. I think we are going to continue to look at the assets. There is so much uncertainty now certainly around whether it's tax rates around everything else. We are going to continue to look at everything on its own merits and continue to be very disciplined in what we are looking at. But, we have the money, it doesn't mean we are going to rush out and spend it. Vijay Kumar : And just a follow-up for that. is that the net impact of water tax and corporate tax, is that a -- in general that's a positive benefit for Hologic, somewhere around 500 bps of production tax rate, is that how should we be thinking about it? Bob McMahon : Yes, Vijay. This is Bob. It is a positive for us when you think about our manufacturing and obviously our revenues are largely U.S. based but also when you look at our COGS, it's roughly 70 :30 U.S. international. So we would expect to be benefiting. It's hard to put a number on that because we don't know what the actual base rate is. But, rest assured we would expect to be a net beneficiary associated with any kind of border tax adjustments. Operator : We will hear next from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Thanks. Steve, can you talk a little bit about international breast health flat in the quarter but presumably you got a timeline for that to start to grow, is there right management team there. So can you just talk a little bit about when you think that may start growing again? Steve MacMillan : Sure, Tycho. As we said, earlier on diagnostics and surgical probably leading the growth internationally given the fact they are more direct than dealer. Having said that, we are seeing some pockets of building and even our European Breast Health business, where we have put a new leader in place nine or ten months ago we are starting to see some better results there. But you also have other businesses like Latin America that are little more fluctuating. So I think as we look fundamentally, we feel the business getting stronger and I think it will slowly start to tick up over the course of this year. Yes, it's probably going to be more 2018, 2019 before it can hit more of a stride. And again, just as we work through dealer issues and other things. But, feel we are definitely on the right path and making good progress. Tycho Peterson : And then, from my follow-up on skeletal health, you had a tough quarter there last quarter as well. It sounds like things have turned, can you maybe talk what's driven the softness and what you can really do to -- from that business? Steve MacMillan : Yes. I think we probably took our eye off of the ball just a little bit. We have been continuing to evolve the sales organization in the U.S. And frankly, it sold in conjunction in a lot of cases with our Breast Health portfolio. As we launch our firm and have the managers focused on other new products, I think we would probably took our eye a little bit off the ball on staying as focused is also a little bit of competitive activity in the see arm space. But, in general I think just we reported as a segment but it is managed more as a product line to some degree and a relatively small one and just didn't -- haven't delivered for the last couple of quarters. So, but we feel good, the order trends were starting to pick up here. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Thanks Tycho. Operator : We will hear next from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : Hey, good afternoon guys. Thank you. How are you? Steve MacMillan : Hi, Isaac. Isaac Ro : Yes. One question on molecular and maybe a follow up on business development. On the molecular side, I think between yourselves and Roche, there has been pretty good growth trend from a couple of the major players this quarter. Curious, if there is a market share dynamic that you think is meaningful or is it really just market growth, we obviously don't have good visibility into every player, but certainly seems like you guys are holding your own against some of the bigger companies? Steve MacMillan : Isaac, our first assumption whenever we are doing reasonably well is always that the market is doing well. Sometimes after the fact that it actually looks like share has been -- has helped. I mean clearly Roche continues to do well. They are a very strong player. We think we have certainly done okay. But the market was probably half of this in last quarter, we don't have complete visibility but I would always rather assume, it was that then be taking credit for share. Bob McMahon : Having said that, I mean just -- I think the market dynamic has been healthy, but if you look at the major products that we track the three big ones, we definitely believe we are a share gainer over time in all three. Isaac Ro : I think it's helpful. Thank you. And then, just a follow-up on -- Steve MacMillan : I always look to come out after the fact as you know, the same with Genius 3D. Isaac Ro : You got it. Thank you. And then on the business development side, you guys talked a little bit about your plan to invest time in resources there. How do you feel about your ability to execute on M&A to be sent that -- interesting deals you want to flow across your radar tomorrow? Did you feel like you will be able to go ahead and execute on them given the balance sheet? And really I\u2019m just talking about the team from the senior level, do you have all the people in place and will appreciate to the extent that you can comment just remind us the metrics that you guys typically tried it to apply on ROIC versus the EPS accretion when you are evaluating these deals? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Sure, the highest level I put the \u2013 that we do have the team in place now we added our final addition was a Head of Corporate Business Development and I liking it a lot of what we've done internationally with our leaders that over the course of the last year, we put the foundations in place, we put the right people in place. That I do think we\u2019re in good place to execute on deals now. Each division has a very good business development lead and then we\u2019ve got the resource at corporate. So we\u2019ve quietly been building that up and we\u2019ve looked at a lot of deals and I\u2019ve learned long ago from my mentor at Stryker, John Brown. In most cases, the best decision on business development is no, and we'll continue to be very disciplined, but the flow and the amount of time that certainly Bob and I've spent on deals over the last six months much, much better. And I think as we sit here, I probably will be surprised if 12 months from now if we haven't some something, but continuing to stay focused. And to your second point, ROIC is going to continue to be the key part and then ultimately we\u2019ll launch something that is top-line and bottom-line accretive in growth rate for the company. So we'll be looking at things that could accelerate our top and bottom-line growth, not just up for example that would make us bigger. But at the end of the day, it's going to be about both growth rate and ROIC will be the big things we will be looking at as well as obviously being able to leverage our existing channels is always going to be kind of the first port of call. Operator : We'll hear next from Jon Groberg with UBS. Jon Groberg : Great. Thanks a million. Just two related questions for you if you don't mind. The first is if you could maybe give a little bit of more detailed update on the firm and some of the other new products how that did. And then, more broadly I'm curious one of the question works around logic has been some of the assets whether all kind of women's health don't necessarily fit together. I'm wondering if you can just talk about, are you finding synergies or finding ways to better find revenue synergies whether it would be to the OB/GYN channel across all the different products. I'm just kind of curious how that sales development is going with your existing assets and kind of what opportunities you might think in the future. Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Sure, Jon. I think the first part in terms of our firm, I think we feel very good about each of our products continuing to build momentum. And I think as we said about things like a firm, the firms going to add to our growth here in 2017. It will be bigger in 2018 than it will be in 2017, it will be probably even bigger in 2019 than it is in 2018. So I think we're in the early stages of all of these launches like virals like a firm and then things that will be coming on behind these. So feeling good about that. In terms of the leverage, I think one of the more obvious paths we\u2019ve been able to leverage is in Genius 3D mammography for example where we\u2019ve been able to detail to OB/GYNs that we have this technology. And in the past all we did is call on radiology. So we are looking and there are opportunities where sales forces are at least talking about some of the other products in our portfolio. And we're looking for them where they opportunistically exist. We\u2019re not forcing synergies where they don't exist. Bob McMahon : And that said even though there is not a tremendous amount of cost synergies. We're still a very profitable business as you know, Jon. Steve MacMillan : Yes. What we also like to as you look forward in terms of our diagnostics business, which is on the molecular side and also the cytology side and then you've got an imaging side. As we look at where science is going the ability to have people that have some general expertise in different modalities of diagnostics across women's health, we think ultimately there are some opportunities that may play out deeper into the future. Jon Groberg : Thanks. Operator : And from Cowen & Company, we'll move to Doug Schenkel. Doug Schenkel : Hi guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Both things I want to talk about are specific to diagnostics. In the U.S. and the quarter with some extra days we might have expected a bit more growth. I was just hoping that you might be able to provide a little more color on how things broke out between blood, cytology and U.S. molecular specifically. And then on a more positive note, international sales was strong in diagnostics. I know it's early to say too much about how things are progressing with the international sales force and how they are progressing, but it would just be good to hear a little bit more about whether this is driven largely by instrument placements or whether utilization is also ramping up. Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Sure, Doug. I think the highest level in terms of the U.S., lot of our customers we actually have sort of standing orders every month and the extra days didn't have as much of an impact as we probably would have thought. We traditionally do very little business in that week between Christmas and New Year. So, it helped a little bit. It would have been nice to help more maybe, but again I think a fairly light week. Internationally, Panther placements I think continue to be probably the single biggest driver, utilization is starting to get up, but we're definitely getting some new customer wins that's starting to drive that. Bob McMahon : Yes. I was going to say Doug a couple of other things to think about we had mentioned the -- one the headwind of the cystic fibrosis product that we are going against. So if you actually strip that out that was couple of million dollars in the quarter last year that didn\u2019t happen this year. That would add at least the 0.5 of growth. In addition to your point around blood actually declined in the U.S., high single-digit. And so despite the sales of the Zika and so forth, it was still down and so that is actually depressing the overall diagnostics business and if you strip that out the business would be a lot better in the U.S. Operator : We'll go next to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Steve MacMillan : Hi David. Scott Lange : Hi, guys. This is actually Scott Lange asking for David. Two quick ones from me, Steve or Bob, the 2Q revenue guidance adjusted for blood screening and the [stud] [[ph]] sales seems a little light versus our assumptions. Are there any timing related dynamics to consider in the second quarter or pull forward into the first quarter? Steve MacMillan : There is not pull forward I can promise you that. I think it's our toughest comp. I think we're going to easier comps in the third and fourth quarters. So it's a little bit below our annual guidance, but\u2026 Bob McMahon : Yes. And the other thing is Scott, when you're looking at -- when you're modeling our surgical business typically the fourth quarter -- calendar quarter, which is our first quarter is the largest quarter there and you'll have a sequential decline for our second quarter that happened last year we're anticipating it happening in this year. So when you look quarter-to-quarter that's when you would see that core business sequential decline largely because of the surgical business. Now versus a year ago, we still expected to grow, but you do see that kind of step down. Steve MacMillan : Yes. That business is becoming a bigger chunk. It probably is a little bit more pronounced. Scott Lange : Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up for Bob, regarding the dilution from blood screening, does an ASR not make sense to lock -- in order to lock-in some dilution offsets and can you also comment quickly on the margin dilution you expect from the overall blood screening divesture? Thank you. Bob McMahon : Yes. Every company has -- each indication or instances is different around whether an ASR is appropriate or not. What I would say is we have -- we still look at our balance sheet and say hey, we can clean it up with the converts and simplify our balance sheet there. And I think given the short-term nature of those things getting ready to be callable. I think that's probably our first priority versus an ASR. And then, again, as Steve was talking about we're really looking at opportunities for growth as well. And so I think those would probably take priority over the share repurchase and we think that there maybe some opportunities as Steve said between now and the end of the year or year from now we would expect to be doing something in both of those cases, so that's kind of how we're thinking about that. On the margin perspective to your point, we do -- blood was a very profitable business as you know, our margins will decline. Again on a core apples-to-apples basis, we expect margin to increase year-over-year, but you would see a slight decline versus year ago on an actual reported basis. Less than probably 100 basis points given that we do have still at 4 plus months worth of blood in our business, but that kind of -- should give you a kind of a perspective. Operator : We'll hear next from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian Weinstein : Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. Question on OUS infrastructure, you talked about some of the heads that you have in place now in kind of the four territories that you decided, but could you talk about any added investments that are needed to either people or infrastructure over the next several quarters and how you think about profitability OUS versus U.S.? Steve MacMillan : Sure. We've got the right leaders in place. We're investing in people -- adding sales people were needed and all of that, but we're all self funding effectively that and just being rigorous like we are in every decision we make add few, so we're not coming out and saying hey, we're going to take a quarter or a year half while we make investments. We're self funding those as things take off in one market, we'll add some reps for example in another market and build it that way. So, I think we feel good, overall to your second part of that question, profitability internationally is lower. We typically on a margin basis, we typically have a combination of factors from some lower selling prices, we're also by the way because we produced a lot of our products in the U.S, the strong dollar is not \u2013 not our friend as it relates to international margin. And also going through dealers particularly in the Breast Health, all of those serve to depress the gross margin, which therefore as our business continues to grow and international picks up, the ability for that much more expansion of gross margin starts to moderate. Bob McMahon : Yes. Couple of follow-on things on that Brian, I think one of the things that's really exciting is the opportunity now that we do have these regional heads and they are going to be able to prioritize the investments across the regions rather than having the spread them across the globe and that's what those teams are doing right now and I think that actually-- we\u2019re actually increased the productivity of the spend that's there. And then on the second piece while international is lower -- lower margin than the U.S., year-over-year, we do expect margins to expand on a global basis. So we're compensating for that. Brian Weinstein : Okay. Thank you guys. Operator : We'll go now to Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Anthony Petrone : Thanks and good afternoon. Maybe couple on Breast Health and then two quick tax questions. Just on Genius installed base, I'm not sure you\u2019ve given at the end of the quarter, but if that's available that would be helpful. And Steve you mentioned share gains -- continued share gains in the U.S. driving Breast Health, I'm just wondering what the outlook is going forward for ongoing share gains. And then on tax, I'm just wondering what the political environment. It looks like a logic could be a big beneficiary as it relates to both border tax adjustment, but also the reduction in statutory tax rate, so any thoughts around that would be helpful. Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Sure, Anthony. On the Genius placements, we only provide the numbers on an annualized basis, so we did that at the end of last quarter. We don't provide quarterly numbers. Having said that, it grew modestly in the U.S. this quarter versus the same quarter last year, so continuing to grow. And on the share front, I think we continue to feel good that we are probably punching above our weight and continue to feel good about what we're doing in terms of market share gains there. Bob McMahon : Yes. Steve, let me add in a shadow out to our Breast Health team here in the U.S. is just doing a fantastic job around price and price discipline. So despite two competitors at a lower price, our pricing continues to now only be stable, it was actually up slight in this last quarter. I think that speaks to the value of our products that competitive differentiation that we have in the ongoing clinical and technical support that we have with our product. So I think that's one of the hidden gems that are helping to continue to drive that business. And then on tax, as you rightly assume, we do think that we will be a beneficiary of whether it would be kind of the border tax or more -- any type of corporate tax reform. There is still a lot of details to be kind of figured out there. But one thing, I think we're probably in pretty good shape given not only our geographic footprint from a revenue perspective probably even more so. So, our geographic footprint from a manufacturing essentially all of our -- almost all of our Breast Health business and diagnostics business has produced here in the U.S -- our surgical business outside the U.S., but that's obviously our smallest piece and as I said before roughly 70% of all of our COGS, M&A is out of the U.S. So I think we would benefit nicely given the potential for corporate tax reform. Operator : And from Leerink Partners, we'll move to Richard Newitter. Ravi Misra : Hi, this is actually Ravi in for Rich, can you hear me okay? Steve MacMillan : Yes, Ravi. Ravi Misra : Hi, great. Thanks for taking the question. Just maybe one on the capital deployment areas, is there any sort of limit to how much of the converts that you guys can refer just or sort of any covenants loaning the amounts that you will be able to call back? And then, I just kind of sneaking a follow-up on sort of portfolio management and strategy with the underperformance in the skeletal health business. Are you guys for now, what's your take on whether the portfolio needs to be where is that or are you continuing to evaluate the businesses for additional sales or not? And then I'm trying to get one last one in, some of our checks here are talking about strong flu season, any commentary there would be appreciated. Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Yes. We'll take the last one first and our flu related assets are very small, so that's our -- not a real impact for us. I would say I guess on the converts, there are certain limitations if you would go out and privately negotiate those creeping tender rolls and so forth it depends on. It also depends on whether the -- the holders are willing to sell. So that would happen overtime, but again within 12 months those things are all going to be callable. And the last one I think was around skeletal and underperformance there. When I can't sell a business because it had one or two quarters of underperformance we think -- first thing is, let's fix it, we're not going to sell it in that. And the other thing is, it does have -- it's fairly integrated into our breast and skeletal -- our breast business especially around the service component and so we've got a large installed base as well as the service tax out in the field that can service both our products. So it's probably more integrated actually than even the blood business that we do just recently divested. Bob McMahon : Callianna, I think we're coming up on 5.30 Eastern, so I think we've got time for maybe one more question. Operator : And that will be from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik de Bruin : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Steve MacMillan : Hi, Derik. Derik de Bruin : Hey, thanks. Couple of questions. So the cytology markets has been very tough, obviously some changes in protocol and such, is there anything that you see that can potentially sort of revitalize the business. And then also along those lines, you mentioned some of the products in the perinatal market, are you looking like pre-eclampsia or some other things in that area, can you sort of elaborate on that? Steve MacMillan : Sure, Derik. I think as it relates to cytology, the way we think about it is, flattish in the U.S. is probably about as good as, as we could expect for sometime here and as we continue to offset the extension of the intervals with our own share gains. We still do think there is opportunities outside the United States, significant opportunities that is going to be a longer term build. But when you look at the presence of liquid base cytology outside the U.S. it's still underdeveloped. So there we think we do have some opportunities. On the perinatal piece, I would say we've got our own clinical programs and it maybe more indication related or other things that we're looking at, but we realized we've got a nice little perinatal business and a dedicated sales team there. So there are maybe some opportunities to try to drive that business, that's one of the smaller businesses that we've quietly refocused on a little bit internally so you don't forget about it and starting to feel there are maybe some opportunities for us in the coming years. Operator : And thank you everyone. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. Thank you everyone. Have a good evening.",

LLC Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to the Hologic, Inc. Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cody, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Please go ahead, sir. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Cody. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today, then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived on our website through June 2. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known, as well as unknown, risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings release. Finally, unless otherwise noted, all percentage changes that we discussed will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. It was another good quarter in terms of our financial results, with both revenues and earnings per share exceeding our guidance. And it was a transformational quarter from a strategic perspective as we made tremendous progress in three areas that will help drive the next chapter of our sustainable growth story : International expansion, our R&D pipeline, and business development. It's a testament to the strength and dedication of our team that we delivered constant currency growth in core revenues, excluding blood screening and Cynosure, of 5.4% and EPS growth of 21.6% while simultaneously building new global capabilities, launching multiple new products, and closing two major deals. All in all, this was the busiest and most productive quarter we've had since I joined Hologic more than three years ago, and our accomplishments accelerate our transformation into a sustainably higher growth company. With that introduction, now, I'd like to provide an overview of our second quarter revenue results highlighting international and new products. Then, I'll discuss growth opportunities at Cynosure before handing the call over to Bob. In the second quarter, reported revenue of $715.4 million grew 3.2% on a reported basis, or 3.8% in constant currency. This includes partial quarter contributions from both Cynosure and blood screening. If you were to back out Cynosure sales, revenue would have been $699.4 million, exceeding our most recent guidance of $675 million to $685 million. Of this amount, revenues from our divested blood screening business totaled $38.3 million, down markedly from the prior period \u2013 prior year period, but still about $10 million higher than expected. Net of these, as we said, revenue in our core business grew 4.7% on a reported basis, or 5.4% in constant currency. As you've seen in recent periods, our ongoing efforts to both revitalize and reshape our portfolio paid dividends again in the second quarter. As a reminder, if we rewind to 2015, it was our U.S. Breast Health division that drove growth behind the rapid adoption of Genius 3D mammography. As this growth driver slowed last year, Surgical emerge to pick up the slack. And now, in the second quarter, as Surgical annualized some competitive benefits, our molecular diagnostics and international businesses both stepped up to post double-digit growth rates, with Cynosure waiting in the wings for the future. With that context, let's provide some quarterly revenue details. Growth in the second quarter was led by molecular diagnostics where global sales of $142.1 million, increased an exceptional 13.3%. In the United States, where sales increased at a low double-digit rate, our commercial team is doing an excellent job of cross-selling our full product portfolio, gaining market share behind our fully automated Panther system and expanding the market by driving compliance with testing guidelines. Outside the U.S., where sales grew more than 20% for the third time in four quarters, we continue to see the benefits of healthy Panther placements and multiple new product introductions. Our Surgical division also performed well again with global sales of $101.1 million, increasing 11.9%, our ninth straight quarter of double-digit growth. NovaSure sales were basically flat as expected, as we have annualized the benefit of a competitive recall, but MyoSure continues to shine, with global sales growth again in excess of 30%. In terms of geography, international sales really emerged as a growth driver in the quarter, growing 11.1%, excluding blood screening and Cynosure. While we still have a lot of work ahead of us, let me remind you that over the past 12 months, we have hired four new commercial leaders for Latin America, Asia-Pacific, Canada and Europe. These leaders have been busy building the foundation for strong and sustainable growth in the years ahead, while already putting a few wins on the board. While molecular diagnostics and Surgical led the global growth this quarter, we also believe that our international Breast Health business is improving as new leadership works on a country by country basis to optimize channel strategies and strengthen our commercial capabilities. International Breast Health sales increased at a mid single-digit rate in the second quarter. And the opportunities ahead of us remain robust. To further capitalize on these opportunities, in April, we acquired Medicor, our long-time distributor of breast and skeletal health products in Germany, Austria and Switzerland Although this is a small acquisition, it provides us a nice platform for future growth by giving us direct access to our customers and full control over commercial strategy. In addition, it's a good example of the kind of tuck-in acquisitions that we continue to pursue, even after the larger Cynosure deal. So, while we are not yet declaring victory outside the United States, I can honestly say that for the first time since I joined the company, we can see clear capabilities to drive strong and sustainable growth in our international business in the quarters and years ahead. Another reason we are optimistic about our future prospects, both internationally and domestically, is the steady cadence of new products beginning to emerge from our R&D pipeline. For example, sales of new products continue to increase and exceeded $25 million in the second quarter, led by MyoSure REACH and the Affirm prone biopsy system. While this revenue is obviously not all incremental, we are nonetheless pleased with our progress and we continue to add more new products. In the second quarter, we launched our next-generation NovaSure ADVANCED product in the United States. We announced FDA approvals of two important new diagnostic assays, our viral load tests for HIV-1 and the hepatitis C virus. And we continue to expect U.S. regulatory clearance for our hepatitis B assay next year. Now, let me turn to our third major initiative, business development. As you can imagine, closing both the blood screening divestiture and the Cynosure acquisition in a single quarter was no small feat, and I'd like to publicly thank our team for all the hard work and long hours involved. Together, these two deals de-risk our product portfolio, will accelerate our long-term growth rates and provide us opportunities to expand profit margins. Overall, they have made us a fundamentally stronger company. Cynosure added $16 million of revenue to our second quarter results based on sales recorded after the acquisition closed. For the full March quarter, however, Cynosure sales totaled only $77 million. Although the March quarter is seasonally weak for Cynosure, sales also were negatively affected by the significant distraction that began early in the quarter when a media outlet reported that Cynosure was in talks to be acquired. These negotiations clearly distracted management's attention and resulted in unusually high turnover in the sales force, as well as delayed hiring of new reps. Together, these changes had a significant but transient effect on revenue. With the deal now closed, we've made great progress on stabilizing the sales force, just as we did with Hologic three years ago. And also like Hologic, the Cynosure sales force has innovative, market-leading products to work with. Looking beyond this March quarter blip, which doesn't affect Hologic's results anyway, we see two huge positives in Cynosure, an attractive growing market and technological leadership that has led to great products. Cynosure has tapped into and helped create a movement toward less invasive aesthetic treatments, an area that we believe has tremendous growth potential for many years ahead. In terms of the market, medical aesthetics growth is being driven by major societal trends, an aging population, higher levels of disposable income, and a focus on personal appearance in a world of selfies. And even after Allergan's acquisition of ZELTIQ which, by the way, operates only in the body sculpting segment, the overall aesthetics market remain highly fragmented. Cynosure has become the clear leader in the overall market, thanks to its deep expertise in lasers, which in turn has produced best-in-class products. Cynosure's core competency is identifying customer needs and finding products to meet them, either through organic innovation or external business development. I'd like to highlight three of these Cynosure products now. These products serve as the foundation for the revenue categories that we will disclose going forward, body contouring, skin and women's health and other. We're hopeful that as we provide more transparency on Cynosure's products and business, you'll come to share our excitement about our future in medical aesthetics. In non-invasive body contouring, most of you are familiar with SculpSure, a 1060 nanometer laser that was launched in late 2015. This is a large market today, totaling over $1 billion, but it remains very underpenetrated. So, we believe there is more than enough room for multiple players. This is especially true given the inherent competitive advantages of SculpSure, which have been demonstrated by roughly 1,400 unit placements and very solid head-to-head performance since launch. In addition, we believe that SculpSure has many opportunities for future growth. For example, we recently filed for regulatory approval to use this system on the back for bra fat and on the inner and outer thighs. We also are completing clinical trials for an indication to use SculpSure under the chin in what's the called the submental area. We expect that SculpSure's efficacy in this area will be a further competitive differentiator, and hope to receive regulatory clearance in the first half of fiscal 2018. Finally, let me mention that we believe we can help drive consumer demand for SculpSure, building on the successes we've had with Genius 3D Mammography. As this demand built, we expect to sell an increasing number of disposables, known as PAC keys, associated with the system thereby boosting sales and profitability. In fact, we're pleased that consumable sales began to pick up in the last quarter. The second product I want to highlight, one that may be overlooked by the investment community, is PicoSure. After years of internal development at Cynosure, PicoSure was the first picosecond laser approved by the FDA in 2013, and it remains the gold standard today, with about 1,000 placements in the field and 1 million patients treated worldwide. Unlike traditional lasers which rely on intense heat that can generate significant redness and downtime, PicoSure is a gentler option that activates the body's natural cellular response to revitalize skin with minimal discomfort and downtime. PicoSure has been used mainly for tattoo removal historically and is differentiated because it employs different wavelengths that can remove all colors of tattoo ink from various skin types. But PicoSure is increasingly being used for skin revitalization, the removal of pigmented lesions, acne scars and wrinkles, especially on the face. As shown by a number of studies presented recently at the Annual Meeting of the ASLMS, PicoSure and the disposable focus lens array generate similar or better results in nanosecond lasers, but with fewer treatments and less downtime. We believe the market here could become very large as we educate providers and patients about the differentiated benefits of PicoSure. Almost everyone can benefit from facial skin revitalization, and patient satisfaction is exceptionally high. In addition, PicoSure has significant potential outside the United States. In China, for example, PicoSure has been approved for tattoo removal, but we intend to submit for regulatory approval for pigmented lesions later this year. The third product I want to highlight is MonaLisa Touch, a fractional CO2 laser that is used to treat the painful symptoms of menopause, as well as women with vaginal problems following a hysterectomy or breast cancer treatments. The product, which we distribute for the Italian company El.En., delivers controlled laser energy to the vaginal wall to promote collagen generation and rejuvenate the vaginal mucosa. At the risk of sounding too bullish, the market for this product could be enormous. In the United States alone, more than 30 million women experience genitourinary symptoms of menopause or GSM, which is also called vaginal atrophy. In terms of potential domestic placements, Cynosure has sold roughly 700 MonaLisa Touch systems to date out of an estimated 16,000 women's health focused practices. And for many women, the therapy can be truly life-changing, as evidenced by 18 published studies and many other trials currently underway. MonaLisa Touch was rapidly adopted in 2015 in its first year after launch, but sales stalled in 2016 as new competitors entered the market and Cynosure devoted sales resources to SculpSure. We believe the product can do much better as part of Hologic, where we can leverage our large OB/GYN sales force to generate leads among our customer base we know very well. Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me summarize by saying that we are excited about the current and future opportunities for Cynosure to grow in the medical aesthetics market. Similarly, we remain enthusiastic about the potential of our R&D pipeline, as well as the momentum that is building internationally. We made tremendous progress on all these fronts in the second quarter, while simultaneously posting revenue and earnings result that exceeded expectations. Now, I will turn the call over to Bob. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to highlight some of our other divisional sales drivers, walk through our second quarter income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics and then finish up with our updated financial guidance for 2017. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Steve mentioned, we posted good financial results in our second quarter, highlighted by 5.4% constant currency growth in our core business, when you exclude blood screening and Cynosure. Steve already highlighted molecular diagnostics and Surgical, so I'll start my discussion with Breast Health. Global Breast Health sales up $280.5 million, increased 2.1% in constant currency against the challenging prior year comp. In the United States, incremental placements of 3D gantries continued to moderate, like in recent quarters, as we pursue smaller, more price-sensitive customers. But at the same time, booking trends remained solid, and our backlog is healthy. In addition, more than 75% of American women in our target patient population now have incremental insurance coverage for 3D, which we believe will solidify even broader market adoption over time. Also in the second quarter, Breast Health service revenue again benefited from an expanding installed base in the U.S. with low double-digit growth year-over-year, while sales of our new Affirm prone biopsy system continue to build. And as Steve mentioned, international Breast Health sales grew at a mid single digit rate for the first time in over a year as new leadership continues to make good progress in optimizing our distributor relationships. Now, moving on to cytology and perinatal. Global revenues of $115.6 million were essentially flat in constant currency. The story here really hasn't changed much. We maintain very high market shares domestically, yet still face headwinds, albeit moderating from longer cervical cancer screening guidelines intervals, and we see significant opportunities outside the U.S. both to increase market share within liquid-based cytology and to drive conversion from traditional Pap tests over time. To wrap up the revenue discussion, Skeletal Health revenues of $21.8 million decreased 1%, a slight improvement over disappointing results in the first quarter. Now, moving down the P&L. Gross margins of 63.9%, decreased 190 basis points compared to the prior year, mainly due to the blood screening divestiture, the negative impact of a stronger dollar and product mix. Total operating expenses of $223 million were up slightly compared to the prior year, mainly due to the addition of the partial quarter Cynosure expenses at the end of the quarter. Beyond this, operating expenses remained well-controlled, helping to support a very healthy operating margin of 32.7% in the quarter. And to round out the discussion of the income statement, a lower effective tax and a slightly reduced share count enabled us to once again increase EPS at a multiple of sales growth. Specifically, reported EPS of $0.50 grew 6.4% compared to a year ago, double the rate of reported sales growth. As noted in our press release, blood screening contributed $0.04 to EPS. So, if you back this out, along with $0.01 from Cynosure, you can see that non-GAAP EPS in our core business grew by more than 20%. I'll quickly touch on a few key financial metrics, beginning with the balance sheet. Total debt decreased $123 million compared to the prior year. We are very proud that we were able to fund the Cynosure acquisition with cash from the blood screening divestiture, with no need to increase debt. Our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, currently stands at 2.1 times, although that number would be approximately 2.7 this quarter if we were to adjust for the roughly $650 million in taxes on the gain from our blood screening divestiture. We remain comfortable with our debt level and strong cash flow generation. We believe we have more than enough capacity to continue to pursue small tuck-in acquisitions like Medicor, eliminate our convertible debt, and opportunistically act on our outstanding share repurchase authorization. Now, before moving to our updated financial guidance, let me mention that adjusted EBITDA was $255.9 million in the second quarter, an increase of 0.8% compared to the prior year. And return on invested capital was 13.2% on a trailing 12-month basis, a 150 basis point improvement over the prior year. Finally, let's turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and the third quarter, and begin with our full year sales guidance. As a reminder, our previous guidance range of $2.785 billion to $2.825 billion included mid single-digit constant currency growth for our core business, once you back out sales from our divested blood screen franchise. Now, as we move to the fiscal third quarter, there are a few moving pieces, especially the addition of Cynosure, but our view of the core business remains constant, with an expectation of mid single-digit growth. So, taking into our account our Q2 results and adding Cynosure, we now expect reported revenue of $3.05 billion to $3.08 billion in fiscal 2017, representing a reported growth rate of 7.7% to 8.7%. Based on recent exchange rates, this equates to high single-digit constant currency growth of between 8.4% and 9.5%. Included in our updated sales guidance is roughly $115 million to $125 million from our divested blood screening business, higher than our previous guidance, due mainly to the stronger performance in the second quarter. Also included in our guidance is an estimated full year contribution of $235 million to $245 million from Cynosure. Now, this may prove to be a conservative estimate, but we want to give ourselves some time to master the cadence of the business, as well as acknowledge that recently hired sales representatives will need some time to get up to speed. Also as a reminder, Cynosure's December quarter, our first quarter of fiscal 2018, is typically their seasonally strongest. Now, let's move on to our revised EPS guidance for the full year. As a reminder, our previous guidance range of $1.90 to $1.94 included roughly $0.13 related to blood screening. We are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to a range between $1.98 and $2.02, which includes a $0.14 contribution from blood screening and a Cynosure impact of between $0.03 and $0.05 as previously communicated. Please note that while we will continue to see blood screening revenue throughout the year as we fulfill our contractual obligations to Grifols, these sales will have a minimal impact on EPS. So again, by way of illustration, if you were to back out blood screening EPS from this year's forecast and last year's and also remove our Cynosure estimates at their midpoint, our forecast continues to imply reported EPS growth rates for our core business in the mid-teens on an apples to apples basis. Now, I'd also like to provide some color on the non-GAAP margins that are embedded in our guidance following the blood screening divestiture and the Cynosure acquisition. In terms of gross margins, blood screening was more profitable than our corporate average, while Cynosure is lower. Netting these out, our second quarter gross margin should be a good base from which to build going forward. It's important to note that the product mix for Cynosure is in the early stages of shifting from hardware to higher margin consumables, so we expect profitability to improve over time. In terms of the overall company operating margin line, we carried minimal operating expense for blood screening, while Cynosure invests heavily in sales and marketing. As a result, we expect operating margins of around 30% in the back half of the year. This remains one of the best operating margins amongst our peers, and as I mentioned previously, we see room for improvement going forward. Our new guidance assumes a full year tax rate of approximately 31% and diluted shares outstanding of between 287 million and 289 million for the year. As usual, our guidance does not assume any capital deployment. Finally, for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect sales of between $790 million and $805 million. This includes blood screening sales of between $5 million and $10 million, as well as Cynosure results of between $110 million and $115 million. We expect earnings per share of $0.48 to $0.50 in the third quarter, which includes a small benefit from Cynosure and minimal impact from blood screening. As you update your forecasts, we would again encourage you to model around the midpoint of our guidance ranges. We have incorporated both upsides and downsides into our forecast. There is uncertainty around the remaining blood screening revenues. And obviously, the Cynosure business is new for us. So before opening up the call for questions, I'd like to reiterate a point made by Steve earlier. Our second quarter was another good one in terms of financial results and a great quarter from a strategic perspective. In our core business, molecular diagnostics and Surgical continue to drive growth, while our international business is contributing progressively more as well. We're seeing the pipeline of organic innovation continuing to expand, and we've set the stage for the next chapter in our sustainable growth story by divesting the blood screening business and acquiring Cynosure. With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, and then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Isaac. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, guys. I wanted to start with Breast Health. Obviously, you mentioned the double-digit growth outside the U.S. Can you talk a little bit more about what's going on in the U.S. market? Obviously, it's a little bit more mature there in terms of penetration for Tomo and there's, I think, a little bit of a new backdrop here politically. Trying to figure out if this new policy change, if that'll impact hospital capital spending. So, anything that you could tease out in terms of how the quarter went in the Breast Health equipment side, and then just sort of your expectation for the rest of the year in the U.S. That would be a great start. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. Great, Isaac. And by the way, just to make sure that we didn't mix up things, the international Breast Health business grew at about mid single-digit rate. The overall international business grew at double-digit. So, I just want to make sure and clarify that. I think in the U.S., I think the simplest way to think about what we're seeing in the U.S. at this point is we've largely gotten all the big hospitals and the big institutions. And so where in the past, the orders, we're getting 5 gantries, 8 gantries, 6 gantries, 10 gantries, we're now kind of moving into that second half, but we're about halfway through our customer base where we're moving out into the community hospitals and it's much more onesies and twosies. And probably, candidly, among audiences and customers that are a little more price, sensitive, that might have gotten in later in the curve last time. And they may be slightly more spooked, I would say, just ever so gently, around what is the moving state of healthcare reform. So, I think in our key big hospitals, everything else, I think we're not seeing any real changes in capital. I think with some of the smaller hospitals, they're probably just being a little more cautious. So, I'd say nothing that we're overly concerned about by any stretch, but I do think we're kind of at that point in the curve where it's getting a little slower and a little harder to keep going and getting much more. So, I think it's why that business, as we've signaled really for quite some time, moving into a lower growth mindset, which is why we are very encouraged with the uptake outside the U.S. And at the end of the day, we're still less than 50% penetrated. So, we still have years' worth of gantries to convert over, it's just going to be in probably smaller orders. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: It's helpful color. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. You guys had a pretty solid revenue beat, but I think I mis-modeled gross margin here. It was a little bit lower than I expected. So, could you talk a little bit about what went on with the gross margin? Obviously, you have some different mix now with Cynosure in the folds, but wondering if there was maybe a pricing dynamic or something else in there on the gross margin that would explain the result. Thanks. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. Hey, Isaac. This is Bob. Yes, to be clear, there really was no pricing impact that impacted our gross margin at all. In fact, we feel very good about our pricing across all of the divisions. It really is a combination of the blood screening divestiture, and actually the over-performance of the blood screening was actually at a fairly low margin, as we have talked about as part of the contractual commitment. So, that impacted us negatively. We did have some effects in there, a little greater than what we had expected, and then there is some product mix issues as well, but nothing materially different than what we had expected. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is Mike Sarcone on for Dan Leonard. Thanks for taking my question. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, Mike. Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: First one, on the mid single-digit full year guidance for the core business. Do you think you could parse out what you're looking for in terms of segment? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. I don't think we're going to get into that level of detail. I mean, I think, we have \u2013 we kind of identified that early on. I think our performance on our molecular business has exceeded our expectations to date, and we expect that to continue to be very strong. Our Surgical business, as we had talked about, had a stronger performance in the first half of the year than the second half of the year, but we're not going to get into giving segment guidance. Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the color there anyway. And just on the Cynosure integration, do you think you can elaborate on what you're doing to kind of unlock potential revenue synergies there? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. I think, simply put, it's a \u2013 first off, getting their sales team back to 100%, and then we are increasingly working with our surgical sales team, and they're going to be working actually as lead generators, particularly the first program we're working on is lead generation for MonaLisa Touch because we believe our OB/GYN sales force has a tremendous number of customers that should be very good customers for MonaLisa Touch. So, I think that will be one of the very first areas. The other piece is I can tell you we're going to inject a little more into the direct-to-patient marketing and generally the marketing area. So, I think the way we look at it overall is they've got unbelievable products and we can probably help on a little bit of the sales generation lead and help on the marketing fronts. I think the other piece that I think we're starting to see is our strong relationships, not only with customers but with the professional organizations, is giving them new access that Cynosure on its own didn't have. And while that \u2013 it's hard to model in a spreadsheet, that does provide us with optionality going forward, and I think that gives us doors that are opening that weren't otherwise opened as a standalone organization for Cynosure. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Jack. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I wanted to start with a two-part around molecular. You talked about driving testing compliance here in the U.S. So, how was growth for trich relative to HPV and CT/NG? And then as you looked at international, do you think you're starting to take some share with viral load? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. I think \u2013 we don't want to get into too much specific detail down to the specific assays, but I think overall what we're seeing is we're getting more docs to order a fuller menu of tests. They can be complementary while they're in there in the U.S., and I think that's what's really helping us drive growth from already very strong market shares. International, I think the virals are helping, but I frankly wouldn't overplay that. I think it's more driven by we're really getting Panther's placed and if you recall, we put a new leader in of our diagnostic sales organization in Europe back in the summer of 2015 and he spent a lot of the back half of 2015 and really into early 2016 rebuilding the team there, and I think that team has really started to hit its stride on both the women's health assays and virals as well. But I think it's more a Panther-driven story than truly a viral load-driven story at this point. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. I would agree, Steve, and maybe provide a little more color commentary on the U.S. If you look across all of the three main assays, we believe that we gained share in the quarter, very robust shares already. So, very strong growth not only in trich, but HPV and CTGC as well. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And thanks for all the details on Cynosure too. I was hoping you could elaborate just a little bit on the sales force disruption in the quarter with the deal. Just what is the guidance to assume in terms of a ramp-up in productivity over the next couple of quarters? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. In simple terms, like, I think the best way is to paint a picture for you and you guys know it's to be as straightforward as you can be. You recall there was a leak that they were being potentially shopped. They then had their national sales meeting, probably at the worst time humanly possible, which was about two weeks after that leak, and Mike Davin, who has been the incredible leader and continued with us. Mike was \u2013 been with that business for 13 years, 14 years. He couldn't even go to the sales meeting because of the process. So, he had to Skype into the sales meeting. So, you put a sales organization together in a room, their long-time leader is not there and he's answering questions on Skype, but by the way, he couldn't even really be as honest with them because, as we all know, in that time period you can't discuss. And I think the sales team sensed that, and we lost some good people in that realm. So, there were a few people that were, I think, on the fence, and lost them. We're completely rebuilding those. It reminded me, we've lost a ton of people right before we came to Hologic, and obviously Mike's built a good commercial team over time. We know how to do that. Having said that, the other piece I would tell you is it delayed some people that offers were out to. Who is going to join a company when you don't know exactly where it stands. So, there were some territories that were open for a while. They've now all been filled, but I think we're not yet necessarily assuming they're going to be back to 100% strength this quarter. I think, by the time we enter our fiscal 2018, we ought to be in great shape, but the next quarter or two it will be nothing like it was last quarter. We'll be making incremental progress this quarter as the guidance implies, and then I think a better quarter from there, and six months from now, I think, completely behind us. Operator : Thank you. We'll hear next from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Raj. Operator : Sir, please check your mute function. We are unable to hear you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Raj, are you with us? Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Yes. Sorry, had it on mute, apologies. I wanted to follow a bit on the breast imaging business in the United States. I'm curious, is there anything you can offer in terms of how it is competitively out there? We've seen Fuji come into the market, but conversely we've also seen reimbursement expansion. So, maybe just some more detail on the complexion of market at this point. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, Raj. I think probably the best way to describe the quarter, and you could see a little bit from the MQSA stuff, while the competitors were out there, they probably had, we would say, more of a slight delaying tactic in any time you have new competitors enter. It gives a hospital that might be on the verge of purchasing a reason to kind of delay and take a peek, and we basically had Fuji, as you well know. The other piece is GE launched their new product called Pristina, which is yet another version of 3D that is still no better than their 2D. And at the end of the day, we don't see having a huge impact, but it may have pushed a few things out. We're still best-in-class. We're holding our pricing. We have seen our competitors being very aggressive on pricing. And frankly, we could probably move a few more gantries if we went down, but we've worked really hard over the last three plus years to maintain pricing discipline which, when you have the best-in-class product, we want to do. So, I think that combined with growing insurance coverage, we continue to feel very good about where the market will go over time, but I think the big \u2013 the huge ramp-ups, I think, are behind us. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: And I think, Steve, to add to that, I mean in terms of share of new placements of Tomo, we are actually still gaining more than our share of the installed base. And with that, actually our ASPs are up slightly year-over-year. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: So, I think the team has done a fantastic job of continuing to roll out the adoption of our 3D, talking to the clinical and technical narrative and value of that, and I think it shows in the market, in the competitive position that we have. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : That's helpful. Maybe just for my follow-up, staying on 3D. When you think about where we are from a penetration standpoint, still maybe less than 30% of gantries have converted, near as we can tell. As you look out into the future in terms of the events that might \u2013 sort of a catalyst perhaps for faster adoption when we've already seen significant publications, and you mentioned 75% of women are now covered from a reimbursement standpoint, is there anything we can look to that could perhaps accelerate this market or the adoption at this point? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Nothing that we dramatically see. To be honest, I think the \u2013 you think about back to the 2D curve when the DMIST study came out, that really popped it. That came out earlier in the lifecycle. I think, at this point, we've already had the JAMA study. But I think we feel very good about much more steady progress as the covered lives continue to come on as more and more consumers become aware of the 3D. I think we just feel really good about the steady cadence. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. And I think, to build on that, Steve, to your point, we've been shipping in that 300-ish range really since the third quarter of fiscal 2015. And what I would encourage folks to think about is really an evolving story of our Breast Health business. As that installed base continues to grow, our service business is actually becoming a big growth driver there. And so, over the last two, three, four quarters, that business has been over $100 million. This last quarter, it grew double digits, really as that installed base continues to grow. And then we have the new products, the Affirm prone biopsy system. Our interventional business, albeit a small part of the business, also performed well in the quarter. And so, I think it is an important component, but not the only component of our Breast Health business. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Steve, sorry to harp on Cynosure, but can you... Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, no problem. We love it, Tycho. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can you help us get comfortable with what's implied about $40 million sequential step-up at the high end of that $110 million to $150 million guidance for 3Q? And can you quantify the magnitude of the sales force churn? It just seems like you were $30 million light relative to consensus on sign-up for the quarter end. How many reps, I guess, turned over? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. We're not going to get into the exact numbers on the sales force turnover. It was reasonably significant. Nothing that we hadn't seen with, frankly, the quarter or two before I arrived in Hologic. And overall, I think we feel very good about the underlying trend. The sales force is very much settled down. And obviously, as we look to the guidance for this quarter, we've \u2013 it's a very different number than what they had last quarter. And I think we feel very good about our ability to be back on track. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: I think the other thing, Tycho, is there is some seasonality in the business that the \u2013 our fiscal second quarter is typically one of the lighter ones for Cynosure. And the third quarter, the fiscal third quarter, is typically strongest. Their strongest is the calendar fourth quarter, which is now our fiscal first quarter. But you do see some natural ramp-up in the third quarter relative to the second quarter as well. So, they're not all equally distributed. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: And I'd tell you, Tycho, we feel better about the mid and longer-term projection for this business today than the day we bought it. But that's short-term disruption, and it's easily the stuff we know how to deal with. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just to follow up on NovaSure. With the ADVANCED out there, should we think about that starting to grow again? Obviously, you've anniversaried the ThermaChoice dynamics, but how significant could ADVANCED be in terms of getting that back on a growth trajectory? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. That business is going against such incredible comps. As you know, we're going against nine straight quarters of double-digit growth for the overall Surgical business. NovaSure itself came up. I would assume it's going to be flattish to slight growth at this point, and we'll actually be shooting for better than that. But as things have settled down, I think hopefully the NovaSure ADVANCED will get it re-growing, but I think pretty modest growth at this point. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: And I think, as we think about our Surgical business, the MyoSure product line continues to exceed our expectations. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: It continues to grow at very strong double-digit growth. And it's becoming almost as big as our NovaSure business on a global basis. So, that's something to consider as well as we think about the overall Surgical business. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Especially when you look at our mix overall, three years ago today, just of our businesses, molecular quietly has snuck up to become really our single largest product franchise. MyoSure has gone from this little brand to a real major contributor. And by definition, our Surgical business has become a much bigger contributor. So, you've got a lot of these mixes here that continue to shift, and I think just keep making us stronger. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Maybe first one, Steve, for you on Cyno. You already mentioned a solid pipeline of Cynosure products. They used to also speak to sort of skin tightening and a flagship that would feed up for 2018. I'm just curious if maybe we can get some thoughts from you on those and are those two products still tracking for commercialization in calendar year 2018. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes, Jon. There's some very good work and additional things that we didn't highlight here today that make us feel really good, and skin tightening being one of those. We want to get our full hands around the complete timing of those, but everything is looking good there. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Maybe just a quick follow-up. I'll actually ask a molecular question because it's a big healthy beat, at least relative to our estimates. You mentioned that the Panther placements driving the numbers over there. You also have the full complement of virals. Can we think about that international continuing? I know it's a law of larger numbers, but continuing to shake out in around that 20% range, helping to drive the overall worldwide into the low double-digits that we saw you guys put up this quarter. Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Jon. I think I'm always leery to be forecasting 20% on top of 20%. Having said that, I think, do we think our international molecular business can at least be a double-digit grower for quite some time. And by the way, we still feel pretty good about the U.S. I don't think we're ready to declare our global molecular business to be a double-digit grower. But I think we feel really good that it's certainly accretive. It's becoming our largest product franchise and it's accretive to our total growth rate. So, we'll see with a few more quarters shaking out, but I think we continue to feel very good about where that is going. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Bill. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi. So, a couple of questions. One, going back to O-U.S. molecular, if memory serves, you guys are kind of on the cusp of launching the Fusion sidecar and some assays there. So, Steve, could you talk about if, I guess, the anticipation of that helped out with Panther placements or is this some potential growth on the come? And then I've got a follow-up to that. Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. I think the real driver internationally has just been Panther in the existing assays, more than the hoping of the Fusion. I think Fusion will be a very nice addition on top of it. I have a few customers. It certainly helps, as we are selling in Panther, for them to understand where we are going overall as a company and it's probably helped a little, but I don't think it's had a huge impact. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. And then on Cynosure and specifically with the surgical training and MonaLisa Touch, is this something that is happening this quarter or is this kind of in the next six months? And then maybe if you could talk a little bit about some of the other cross-selling opportunities, not so much opportunities, but rather timelines as we look out call it a year or so from now. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, Bill. I think the very initial piece with the MonaLisa Touch, we're just in the early innings of having put together the plans for that and really just going to be rolling out to the sales force in the coming weeks. So, I think that's less going to have an impact say this quarter; probably start to have a modest impact next year. But I think will really be a very nice addition as we go into 2018. And as we remind everybody, we didn't buy Cynosure for 2017, felt really good about our core business and where we're going. We very much bought it for the next decade, and I think that's where we're being thoughtful as we're putting together these programs, even as we \u2013 it's as simple as we want to get our GYN/SURG reps to refer their physicians over, but we also want to make sure they don't take their eye off their ball and forget about NovaSure and MyoSure. So we've spent some time with the two selling organizations, coming up with the right incentive scheme so we don't do the old pendulum swing from one to the other. And then I think, assuming good success with MonaLisa Touch on the referrals, there is going to clearly be other opportunities to do more there with other products, I would think. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Vijay. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Steve? Hi, Steve. So, maybe one on Cynosure. I just \u2013 I apologize if you already explained this. And it looks like \u2013 so, because of the disruption, sales were down 19%, right, when I'm looking on year-on-year basis. I just want to understand maybe, Steve, what were the month-on-month trends like Jan, Feb and March? Looks like most of the disruptions happened in March, and I'm assuming the guidance for the June ending quarter assumed some disruption in May. I just want to understand, is that how we should be thinking about the Cyno numbers? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. First off, we're not going to get into month-on-month, Vijay, as you can probably appreciate. We may start to go weekly data. But I think here is the simple piece. Once the deal closed on March 22, we're able to start to get in there, and I'd say morale is in a very different place early May than it was early March. So, we're in a very different place. They really lost people in late \u2013 lost a number of reps, frankly, in late January, early February, and then we've been replacing those and rebuilding. So, again, I think we feel it's very unfortunate, but I wouldn't at all expect that to be a trend. We very much think of it as a blip. And as evidenced by our guidance already for what we have for this quarter, next quarter, we feel like we'll be back on track. We won't be knocking the cover off the ball the way we would like to, say, this quarter, but I think another quarter or two we're absolutely going to be there. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : That's very helpful, Steve. And maybe one for Bob on the guidance. What is the organic revenue guidance for the base business, excluding Cynosure, Bob, in the upgraded guidance? I think the prior one was minus 70 bps to plus 70 bps. I'm just wondering, is there an apples to apples compare? I know you guys beat the quarter by $0.04 on the EPS, but it was raised by $0.08 for the year. So, are there other moving parts on EPS line that we should be thinking about? Thank you. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. I guess, on the core business, Vijay, the way to think about the base business is still that mid single-digit growth rate on the revenue side and low single-digit growth on the EPS side, with that $0.48 to $0.50. There's really no contribution of blood in Q3 from an EPS perspective, and a minor contribution from Cynosure. So, that's the way you should think about it. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Steve, two questions for you. How are you? So, there's a lot of focus in this call about the M&A disruption because of the Cynosure process. I guess, how confident are you that the rep disruption is not the impact of Allergan, ZELTIQ, which may have froze the customer channel and froze rep hiring? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. There is certainly an element of that, David, I think. But I think, now with them closed, us closed, it's back to stuff we know really well, which is building great sales teams around great products. So, I think there was certainly \u2013 there was a lot of chatter and noise and it's \u2013 that's what I want to say, and you get it. That clearly had an impact on sales psyche. That's now all behind us, and we feel very good about our abilities to go forward. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Just two more quick ones. The other things you announced in this call, there's a six-month delay in the submental approval and, as you know, ZELTIQ has that label. So, was that at all a factor in guidance? We were expecting that back half 2017, it's now first half 2018. And then second question, on MonaLisa. How important is it strategically to own the asset versus relying on the distributorship? Thanks very much. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. First one, I don't think the submental is a significant change. It maybe has been communicated, but I think we're very hopeful that that program would be on, I think as we said, later this year. I think we did say our beginning of fiscal 2018, remember that is the end of calendar 2017 for us. So, we're feeling pretty good about where that's going. And on the MonaLisa, owning would be nice, but I think we feel very good about the overall relationship there and the contractual state that we're in with El.En. Operator : Thank you. We'll now... Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Operator, I think we might have time for one or two more questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. No shock on the topic. So, with Cynosure, we see miss in the quarter. Are those revenues that are actually lost? Are those revenues that you were in negotiations with people and then the sales reps to kind of close and you will see later in the year? Can you just talk about if you've lost things to competitors or it's just more of a delay? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes, I think we lost them to competitors, Brian. I think it's \u2013 we had a bunch of reps that weren't showing when you have reps leave and you're in a very customer and sales intensive business, but many of those sales will still be there. It will be later in the year. Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, on the distribution, you made an acquisition named Medicor. Can you talked about any financial impact from that? Is it likely that we'll see others there and why did you start with that one? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. The impact is fairly de minimis in terms of overall revenue and profits, but strategically it's going to give us a very nice shot in the arm. And I think one of the reasons we started there, they were our single biggest distributor in Europe. So, we like them and we were able to do a deal there. They were largely a Hologic dealer. Some of our other countries, we deal with dealers where we may be a minority part of their business, and a lot of complexity. So, we would hope to be able to do more in the years ahead, but they were clearly the one probably we coveted the most. And I think they have a direct presence, particularly in Germany. It's a really nice place to be. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our final question from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. My first question is on Cyno. I think consensus estimates were calling for 12% and 10% growth year-over-year in calendar 2017 and 2018, respectively. Understanding that there was a bit of a blip in this present quarter, how should we think about any changes to the double-digit growth rate trajectory of that business? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: We think that's going to be the ongoing growth rate. We feel great about that business. It's just going to take us probably a couple of quarters to get back to it. I think about it this way. When you look at where our Surgical business was a few years ago, nobody ever would have guessed we could generate nine straight quarters of double-digit growth. I think, our prospects, as we look at the Cynosure business and the underlying market and the products we have, I think, we feel great about our ability to generate great growth. This was just \u2013 it was an unusual year when you have a small company that's very dependent on its leader and its leader is very distracted in a quarter, and it's publicly being all the rumors out there that they're being taken over and this and that. It was a goofy period, but it's totally a blip. It's not an ongoing thing. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. And this is a two-parter. What percentage of revenue came from the non-core channel? And then following that, we did a survey, nearly 60% of physicians in the non-core channel indicated that they may adopt non-invasive aesthetics over time. So, can you just speak to the market size and what you're thinking about the long-term market opportunity from non-core physicians? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. We're not going to break out what percentage of revenue came from non-cores, but we continue to believe non-cores are a huge, huge opportunity. That's what \u2013 when Mike Davin and I first sat down and talked, actually last year, that was so evident to me as to where they were thinking about going with so much of the non-core business. And you think about \u2013 and you saw it, I think, in your research between both OB/GYNs as well as, frankly, even broader GPs, people starting to look for additional ways to make money and take care of women and women's health. We think that there is so much opportunity. It's why we're probably more excited today. To a minor blip in the quarter, big deal, we're going to be past that. We just love the fundamentals of the market, the under-penetration of the docs, and we see great interest from a number of the non-cores going forward. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes the Hologic's second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",

Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to the Hologic Incorporated third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call. My name is Denise, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today; then we'll have a question and answer session. Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived on our website through August 25. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Also during this call we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings release. Finally, unless otherwise noted, all percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We posted solid results overall and delivered on our near-term financial commitments. Revenue exceeded our guidance, and non-GAAP earnings per share finished at the high end of our forecast. Our molecular diagnostics and international businesses continue to emerge as strong growth drivers. And our recently acquired Cynosure business performed in line with our quarterly expectations. From a longer-term perspective, our quarterly results reflect positively on our efforts to revitalize and reshape our business portfolio. If you could have listened to our strategic planning discussions back in 2015, when our domestic Breast Health business was driving tremendous growth, we knew that we needed molecular and international to accelerate when breast inevitably slowed. And that is exactly what has happened, as we upgraded leadership and made the necessary investments. This quarter, in fact, both business, international and molecular, posted double-digit growth, results that would've seemed unlike even a year ago. But while we were working to establish new growth drivers in molecular and international, we were also ramping up R&D in all our divisions to ensure that we could generate sustainable organic growth for years to come. Several of the new products that resulted, like the Affirm prone biopsy system and MyoSure REACH, are making increasing contributions to growth. This quarter, for example, sales of new products exceeded $40 million globally, although obviously this is not all incremental. And other new products are emerging, some of which we'll discuss today. But, before doing that, let's provide a brief overview of our third quarter results. Reported revenue of $806.1 million grew 12.4% on a reported basis or 13.1% in constant currency. Margins were solid based on continued price discipline and solid expense control, which led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50. EPS declined by 2.0% compared to the prior-year period, a small amount considering the comp included a full quarter's contribution from our divested blood screening business. So we are doing an effective job of filling that earnings hole with gains in our base business, as well as Cynosure. If you were to back out blood screening and Cynosure, core revenues grew 2.4% on a reported basis or 3.1% in constant currency. Similarly, core EPS would've increased 11.9% if you excluded blood and Cynosure. So we continue to show good leverage up and down the income statement. So while it was a solid quarter overall, we plan to do better. At Cynosure, our efforts to stabilize and strengthen the domestic sales force are underway under new leadership, and our R&D remains highly productive. And in Breast Health, we are excited about new claims for our Genius 3D mammograms, new insurance coverage, and new products that we're launching now, which we will discuss for the first time today. With that introduction, now we'd like to discuss some third quarter revenue highlights, focusing on molecular diagnostics, international, Cynosure, and Breast Health. Then I'll hand the call over to Bob to cover other revenues, expenses, and our updated guidance. First, growth in the quarter was led by molecular diagnostics, where global sales of $144.1 million increased a very healthy 10.3%. The story here is very similar to prior quarters. In the United States, where sales grew at a high-single-digit rate, our commercial team is doing an excellent job of cross-selling our full product portfolio, increasing market share and utilization of our fully automated Panther system, and expanding the market by driving compliance with testing guidelines. In addition, this quarter we gained FDA clearance for our Aptima assay to detect herpes simplex virus 1 and 2. While the molecular herpes market is not huge, our new test is an important addition to the Panther women's health menu and a nice incentive for new customers to try out the system. Outside the U.S., where molecular sales grew more than 20% for the fourth time in five quarters, we continue to see the benefits of new leadership, healthy Panther placements, and multiple new-product introductions, including our viral load assays. And we recently received a CE Mark for our new Panther Fusion system, which provides lab customers new capabilities and enables them to further consolidate testing on our platform. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but we are on our way to building an international molecular business that rivals the leadership position we've established domestically. Beyond molecular diagnostics, we are very pleased with the continued growth and positive evolution of our international business as a whole. More than a year ago, we said this business felt like a start-up and told you that building the foundations for sustainable growth would take some time. But we laid that groundwork in a very deliberate way, starting with new leadership. Now, for the second consecutive quarter, international sales grew low double digits, excluding blood screening and Cynosure. While we are still early in the game, we are clearly putting points on the board and are encouraged by our progress. One reason we are feeling good about international is the breadth of our performance. In recent quarters, molecular diagnostics and surgical led the charge, but this quarter, every business except Skeletal posted solid growth. In particular, I want to highlight the progress made in international Breast Health. As a reminder, in all four quarters of our fiscal 2016, that business declined. In the first quarter of this year, it was flat; then it grew at a mid-single digit rate in Q2. This quarter, international Breast Health grew in the low teens, reflecting our efforts to optimize channel strategies and strengthen our commercial capabilities. The third area I'd like to discuss is Cynosure. Our view of Cynosure continues to be very optimistic over the long term, though still cautious in the near term. Cynosure posted revenue of $110 million in its first full quarter as part of Hologic. This was much higher than in the second quarter sequentially, and in line with our quarterly guidance. There was a lot to like about Cynosure's performance in the quarter. First, we are pleased with sales of skin-related products, especially PicoSure. Second, overall international sales grew significantly compared to the prior year. Third, sales of consumables increased at a low-teens rate, driven by dramatic growth in SculpSure PAC keys, which illustrates the value that our product is providing in the field. And, fourth, we made important progress in new product development. But at the same time, it's clear that we can improve Cynosure's commercial execution in the United States, just as we did at the larger Hologic three years ago. As we discussed last quarter, there's been a considerable amount of disruption in the U.S. sales force, and newly hired reps are still getting up to speed. To tackle this challenge, we have named Kevin Thornal as Division President of Cynosure. I've personally known Kevin, who engineered the remarkable turnaround in our European Breast Health business over the last year or so, since our years together at Stryker. He is a strong, commercially focused leader who we're confident will have Cynosure growing again in 2018. Kevin replaces Michael Davin, who will be retiring on September 1. Michael built Cynosure into the world's leading medical aesthetics company, and we thank him for remaining with Hologic during the integration process to share his expertise and knowledge. Longer term, we remain enthusiastic about the value of the aesthetics market, as well as Cynosure's ability to lead it. Nothing has changed in terms of the positive market backdrop. With the changes we are making, we are now in an excellent position to capitalize on these tailwinds, with a broad portfolio of differentiated products, the commercial expertise and backing of Hologic in areas like direct-to-consumer advertising, and a robust R&D pipeline. As evidence of this last point, we received FDA clearance ahead of schedule this quarter to use SculpSure, our non-invasive body contouring product, to treat the back and thighs. In addition, we have filed for regulatory clearance to use SculpSure in what's called the submental area, under the chin. This is a significant market opportunity that should boost growth in 2018, as we believe our laser technology provides an advantage over the competition. And, finally, we have filed for clearance of an innovative new radiofrequency platform, which over time will have applications in aesthetic, women's health, and surgical markets. Now we'd like to turn to our fourth subject, Breast Health. In the third quarter, global Breast Health sales of $283.7 million increased a modest 0.9% in constant currency. The U.S. business declined 1.7%, while international sales increased 13%. In the United States, incremental placements of 3D gantries declined, like in recent quarters, as the time required to close deals has increased due to market and competitive dynamics. But at the same time 3D units increased sequentially, booking trends remain solid, our backlog is healthy, we still have roughly half our installed base to upgrade, and we remain a net market share gainer. In addition, other drivers of growth continue to emerge within Breast Health. For example, service revenue again benefited from an expanding installed base in the United States, delivering more than $100 million in sales. Revenue from our interventional products also increased nicely, as we are doing a better job of selling our full portfolio. Finally, sales of our new Affirm prone biopsy system continued to build. In addition to these positive trends, several other factors give us confidence that our domestic Breast Health business will grow in 2018. First, this quarter we earned important new labeling indications that will broaden our competitive advantage. Our sales representatives can now say that Genius mammograms are the only mammograms clinically proven to detect 20% to 65% more invasive cancers than 2D alone, with an average increase of 41%. In addition, only Genius mammograms are FDA-approved as superior to 2D mammography for routine screening of the nearly 50% of women who have dense breasts. This is meaningful because more than 30 states now have laws requiring women to be notified of their breast density. Second, we made significant progress on reimbursement during the third quarter. Approximately 85% of American women in our target patient population now have incremental insurance coverage for 3D, which we believe will solidify even broader market adoption over time. And third, we expect sales of new products to continue to build as we move into 2018. Revenue from our Affirm prone biopsy system is healthy, and we expect to launch Brevera, our innovative new biopsy system, around the end of our fiscal year, so our interventional portfolio is well-positioned for long-term growth. Finally, we wanted to share for the first time that we are in the process of launching our first two new mammography systems since 2011. These new products will enable us to further segment the market and extend our competitive leadership position. Our new 3D Performance system, which has been launched globally, provides the superb image quality that customers have come to expect from Hologic, but with workflow capabilities and throughput that are geared toward smaller, lower-volume customers. In addition, at the high end of the market, the best just got better. Our new 3Dimensions system delivers the industry's fastest, highest-resolution breast tomosynthesis exam, plus a wealth of additional improvements. These include a better patient experience using the SmartCurve breast stabilization system; superior image clarity from our fastest and highest-resolution detector; and faster, better 2D images from improved software and machine learning algorithms. The 3Dimensions system has been launched overseas, where customers are giving it positive reviews, and we expect to introduce it domestically in the coming quarters. So, behind the scenes, our R&D team in Breast Health has been highly productive, and we look forward to these products adding to growth in coming quarters. Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me summarize by saying that we are pleased to have met our financial obligations in the quarter. We expect molecular diagnostics and international to be increasingly important growth drivers in our portfolio and have lots of new product innovation on the way to improve growth at both Cynosure and in Breast Health. So we believe we are well-positioned for the future. Now I will turn the call over to Bob. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to highlight some of our other divisional sales drivers, walk through our third quarter income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, and then finish with our updated financial guidance for 2017. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Steve mentioned, we posted solid results in our third quarter. Molecular diagnostics and international performed well and are emerging as new growth drivers within our portfolio, consistent with our strategic plan. This is an important development, as our domestic molecular business and our international franchises combined to represent nearly 40% of revenue this quarter. And we have initiatives in place to improve growth at Cynosure and in Breast Health, based on both better commercial execution and productive R&D. With that introduction, I'll begin with Diagnostics, our largest division, where revenue of $284.1 million decreased 7.4% due to the divestiture of our blood screening business. Although we closed this transaction last quarter, we do have an ongoing agreement with Grifols for raw material and instrument supply, which yielded $19 million of very low margin revenue in the quarter. This was higher than expected, and much more than we anticipate in the fourth quarter as well. Excluding blood screening, Diagnostics revenue grew a solid 5.4% in the quarter. Since Steve already covered molecular, I'll mention that cytology and perinatal sales of $121 million were essentially flat in the quarter versus a tough comp from last year. In our GYN Surg business, revenues of $106.5 million grew a solid 5.2%. MyoSure continues to lead the charge, with global sales growth of 20.8% in the quarter. NovaSure sales declined 5% as we've lapped the benefit of a competitive withdrawal. Specifically, it's worth noting that the third quarter a year ago was a huge one for NovaSure, as sales grew by nearly 15%, making for the toughest comp of the year for the division as a whole. To wrap up the revenue discussion, Skeletal Health revenues of $21.8 million declined 5%, although we are encouraged by interest in our bone density products, especially for body composition testing in the U.S., and expect this business to improve in the fourth quarter. Now, moving down the P&L, gross margins of 63.1% decreased 260 basis points compared to the prior year. This was mainly due to product and geographic sales mix, the divestiture of our blood screening business, and a full quarter of sales from Cynosure products, which carry a lower gross margin. Total operating expenses of $274.9 million increased 19.9%, primarily due to the inclusion of Cynosure expenses for the full quarter. But if you back these out, we demonstrated good operating leverage, with total expenses declining by 4.2%. As a result, operating margin was 29% in the quarter. This was 480 basis points lower than a year ago due to product and geography sales mix and the blood screening divestiture. However, our profit profile remains among the best in the medical technology industry, and we have nice opportunities to boost operating leverage going forward. To round out the discussion on the income statement, net margins of 18% decreased 220 basis points compared to a year ago, as negative mix was partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. All this led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50, at the high end of our guidance range. Despite the divestiture of the very profitable blood screening business, EPS declined by only $0.01, so we are doing a good job of filling the earnings hole with growth in our base business and Cynosure. Specifically, Cynosure contributed $0.02 to EPS this quarter, so we have already achieved the accretion goal we had established when we announced the deal. If you back this out, along with the $0.01 from blood, non-GAAP EPS in our base business grew 11.9%, much faster than sales. Now, before we talk about our updated guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other key financial metrics, beginning with the balance sheet. Total debt decreased $201 million compared to the prior year. Of note, we repurchased $200 million in principal of our convertible notes for $269.1 million, reducing their future dilutive impact. Our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, currently stands at 2.6 times, and we remain comfortable around this level. One reason we are comfortable with our debt load is that we continue to generate strong cash flow. This quarter, free cash flow was $180.1 million on a normalized basis, excluding the large tax payment we made related to the gain on the sale of the blood screening business. So combined with our revolver, we have plenty of capacity to continue to pursue small, tuck-in acquisitions and eliminate our remaining convertible debt when the notes become callable in fiscal 2018. Now, finally, adjusted EBITDA of $260.7 million decreased slightly compared to the prior year, as improvements in our base business were offset by the divestiture of blood screening business. Now let's turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and fourth quarter, beginning with our full-year revenue guidance. We are reducing our full-year guidance, mainly due to expectations for lower Cynosure sales in the fiscal fourth quarter. While we have made good progress in stabilizing and strengthening the U.S. sales force, we know it will take these reps some time to get up to speed and for our other commercial initiatives to kick in. In addition, the overall medical aesthetics market experiences a seasonal slowdown over the summer months. So our guidance implies a significant decrease in Cynosure revenues compared to the prior year, when sales were roughly $106 million. All in, we now expect reported revenue of $3.04 to $3.055 billion in fiscal 2017, representing reported growth of 7.3% to 7.8%. Based on recent exchange rates, this equates to high single digit constant-currency growth of between 7.9% and 8.4%. If you were to back out Cynosure and blood screening, we continue to expect solid, mid-single digit growth in our core franchises. With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance implies revenues of $785 million to $800 million in the fourth quarter. Compared to the prior-year period, this range reflects revenue growth of 8.0% to 10.1% on a reported basis, or 8.3% to 10.3% in constant-currency terms. For modeling purposes, let me remind you of two things that'll affect our fourth quarter results. First, as we discussed when we initially gave guidance for the year, we have one less selling day in the quarter versus the prior year. We estimate this will depress our growth rates by 70 to 80 basis points or so. But, at the same time, we are due a multimillion-dollar royalty payment from one of our diagnostics partners, which will boost our molecular line. Now let's move on to our revised EPS forecast. We are slightly raising the midpoint of our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year to a range of $2.00 to $2.02, which implies reported growth between 2% and 3.1%, and constant currency growth of between 3.0% and 4.1%. So we are growing non-GAAP earnings for the year despite losing a net $0.22 per share from blood screening. Please note that while we will continue to see blood screening revenue throughout the year as we fulfill our contractual obligations to Grifols, these sales will be much smaller than recent quarters, and essentially have zero impact on EPS. This earnings guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates, a full-year tax rate of 30.5%, and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 288 million for the full year. This full-year guidance translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 to $0.50 in the fourth quarter. This represents a decrease of 3.8% to 7.7% on a reported basis, and 3.4% to 7.2% in constant currency, primarily due to the divestiture of our blood screening business, partially offset by the acquisition of Cynosure. Now, as you update your forecasts, we would again encourage you to model around the midpoint of our guidance ranges, as we've incorporated both upsides and downsides into our forecasts. Now, before opening the call for questions, let me summarize by saying that we delivered on our revenue and EPS commitments in the third quarter. Our results highlight the progress we have made in building a vibrant molecular diagnostic and international businesses over the last couple of years. And at the same time, we re-energized our R&D efforts in Breast Health and are strengthening our commercial capabilities in Medical Aesthetics. We remain bullish that these efforts will pay off as we move into 2018. With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, and then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Absolutely. Our first question today comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. So for starters I could use a little help reconciling the performance in Cynosure. So you performed in line with your guidance in the third quarter, yet you're lowering expectations for that business in the fourth quarter. What are the dynamics in play there? And any more color you could offer would be helpful. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah Dan, in simple terms, it probably is a little head-scratcher. At the end of the day, international came in a lot stronger than we expected, and the U.S. was frankly disappointing. And it says we've got more work to do. And I'll give it to you this way : Obviously when we did the acquisition, we knew there'd been a lot of sales force disruption in the quarter right before we bought it. That leadership team at Cynosure had a long track record, and they said at the start of the quarter they thought things were settling down, and they gave us a number that they thought they would deliver for the quarter. At the end of the day, we came up short in the quarter. I wanted to give them one quarter to let them prove that they were back on track, and at the end of the day, they fell short. So we're making changes. We've just installed a new President, and I think \u2013 so what we will see here in the third quarter is, because international has gotten stronger and there's a normal seasonal slowdown, I think what you're going to see is that seasonal slowdown in July and August internationally is particularly soft in Medical Aesthetics. So I think we see it being a step back before we really start to step forward again, as we go. And I will tell you, I feel really, really good about the commercial leader we've put in to run that business now. But also want to give him a little air cover while he gets his feet on the ground, because there's always a little disruption in that change. So it's really a \u2013 call it a one quarter step back. I think we showed we at least know what we're doing by delivering on the \u2013 frankly at the low end of what we had hoped for in the quarter, but feeling great about international, great about the pipeline, and we do have some work to do in the U.S. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And, Steve, for my follow-up, were there any timing aspects or any abnormal discounting or anything to be aware of to get you to the $110 million in that third quarter, or was the activity more run rate, if you will? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: No, it was run rate. There was no end-of-quarter discounting. If anything I would tell you, frankly, the end of the quarter was probably a little disappointing, which \u2013 in its own way. We might have thought we would have done even a little bit better than where we came in there. So that's what precipitated the change. But I think \u2013 suffice it to say orders \u2013 it's not like we've carried in a bunch of orders either or anything into this quarter. In an ideal world, they would've been running hot, and we might have even been able to carry some or whatever into this quarter. We aren't able to do that. So it is a complete U.S. sales execution issue. We don't break out the U.S./international piece. I would tell you, we are much more excited about the performance internationally than we imagined, and it really is a very isolated issue that we know how to fix. As a reminder, by the way, Kevin Thornal, who we've just put in as Division President \u2013 he's the guy we sent over to Europe 18 months ago, when, many of you remember, our European and especially our global Breast Health business was a disaster. And that business within 18 months of him arriving is now growing at double-digit rates. He's completely put that business back together again. Kevin and I have a long history together at Stryker. He came over to Hologic about three years ago, first into the U.S. Breast Health business, has gone over there. And I would tell you, I'm incredibly excited about what he's going to bring to the business. But he's not going to work magic this quarter. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. I think just to build on that, Steve. I think if you look at it, obviously we felt very good about the performance that we had in international, but also if you look at the non-laser, the PAC key utilization, that also improved across the globe. Most of that here is in the U.S., so it is really about getting that sales organization up and trained and clean it up. And then moving into 2018, we have new products that will help drive that additional growth as well. We talked about submental and then the RF platform as well, so feel good about the future. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, Dan. I'd add one last piece. A year ago everybody thought international was a mess. Now it's a double-digit grower. We look at this and say, you know what? Been there, done that. We'll absolutely be back to great growth rates in this business. Operator : Moving right along, our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Jack. Mitchell Petersen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Hey, thanks. This is actually Mitchell Petersen on for Jack this afternoon. Appreciate all the updates on Cynosure, especially on the new leadership and long-term view there. As of now, is there any reason why in fiscal 2018 this business won't be able to grow in the double digits? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: We're not going to give exact guidance for 2018 yet on this call. Cynosure will grow in 2018. There is no doubt. Mitchell Petersen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, could you just comment on how long do you think it's going to take the Cynosure sales force to get fully ramped up, and are there any productivity improvement metrics you can share with us? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. You know what? We typically are going to assume a six- to nine-month ramp for new reps and new businesses, and I think that would be an appropriate piece here. So I think \u2013 my hunch is this coming quarter is probably the bottom and we start to rebuild even by the end of this quarter. So as we go into calendar year 2018, ought to be looking pretty good. We obviously track internal performance metrics, nothing we're going to share externally. Operator : Our next question today comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Steve, I'll hop over and hit on Breast Health. You threw out a couple things here. You've got the two new systems, new label indications, and then you flagged the increased competitive dynamics. Maybe can you touch on the latter point a little bit? Is it more pricing pressure in the market with GE, and what kind of growth trajectory do you think Breast Health can get back to with the label indications and ultimately the two new systems? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. I think less \u2013 there's always been the price competition. We're still maintaining pricing and not going down that rabbit hole. I think GE has gotten a little more aggressive with their new system just in terms of marketing and activity, but we still feel very good about the ongoing trajectory. I think this is probably a low single digit grower for us as we go into 2018. And we'll certainly aspire to more. But I think just given where we are in the market life cycle as we go into that kind of second 50% of our installed base and further down to the market, that it's just smaller customers, smaller orders. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: I think on that, Tycho \u2013 this is Bob. As part of that, with the launch of the 3D Performance product, that allows us I think to compete more effectively in the smaller volume hospitals and so forth. And we're not going to play the price game, but that provides us with \u2013 our customers with good value and allows us to have a portfolio of products that suit the various needs of our customers more effectively. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then for the follow-up, I want to make sure I understand the dynamics on Cynosure, because it has gone from a double-digit grower to a flat and declining business. And I know there's a sales force churn dynamic, and it seems like you've got a handle on that. But how much of it is also just a timing issue in terms of \u2013 you're repositioning PicoSure for a broader audience, you're leveraging MonaLisa into the OB/GYN channel. Obviously you've got the new product cycles you talked about. So how much of it do you think is sales force related and trying to get them optimized versus just maybe the timing on some of these other initiatives? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: It's probably a bit of both, Tycho. I think they certainly had the tremendous run with the initial launch of SculpSure. So we are going against comps when they were growing at the 20%-plus level. We still think this is a high-growth market over time. But going against those particularly high comps when it was all the capital going in, you're probably dealing with a little bit of that. But overall we continue to feel great about the market dynamics and know that we can have a better commercial execution as we go forward. Frankly, on both sales, but also marketing. I mentioned in the script direct-to-consumer marketing, we're actually just beginning some direct-to-patient marketing programs that they've lacked as a company to date. Operator : Moving right along, we'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe I'll start one on the guidance front. Bob, I think you mentioned the guidance reduction was mostly related to Cynosure. I just want to understand, getting off (37:45) the numbers, so the revenues were lowered, I think, by $10 million to $25 million, right, versus the prior guidance for the overall company of revenues. Now I know that the last guidance was \u2013 you had blood at $115 million to $125 million, and you had Cyno at $235 million to $245 million. Can you just maybe walk us through what changed? Was it all Cyno, or was this a little bit in blood or the base business? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. So the vast majority of the change, Vijay, is due to Cynosure. There's always some moving parts, but the vast majority of it is due to Cynosure. And so I think that that is the area of focus. It wasn't blood. We actually had more blood in the third quarter. We expect a sequential decline but in line with our expectations there. And our base business is roughly in line as well. So obviously, we've got a lot of focus on that part of the business in Cynosure, bringing in new leadership and so forth. But if you look at it, sequential change from where we are in Q3 to Q4, another way to kind of look at it, all of that change is related to Cynosure. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : Got you. Basically it implies that the organic for the base business was unchanged. Steve, maybe one on Cynosure. I know you're getting a bunch of questions on this. I just want to understand, on the sales force raise, are you still hiring sales force for the Cynosure? Do we need to hire more people? Is that what the delta is? Or are we done with the hiring and this is just now a question of getting the sales force ramped up? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Oh, no. There'll be more hiring. There'll be more hiring. We still have some opportunities. And just managing them \u2013 the other piece I'd give you is, we've all seen companies kind of go from that 0 to 400, 500 range, and then you kind of start to \u2013 can stumble a little bit as you go to that next level, and sometimes you need some new leadership to take it to that level. And I think it's exactly what we need on the commercial side. So there will be still a few more changes as we go forth and bringing in more people. Operator : Our next question today comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks much, guys. I have to ask another question on Cynosure. Given what we've seen here with the turnover in the sales force and your earlier comments here and that last question, I'd be interested in sort of if you'd illustrate a couple of the first items of business for Kevin as he takes over. I know you mentioned it's going to take more than one quarter. But I'd love to know a little bit about his program, first couple of specific steps when he takes the job. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, it's really for Kevin to get into. Kevin is one of the greatest sales and commercial leaders you'll find, just as he went over to Europe, and it starts by getting to know the key people and the key opportunities and then repositioning and making sure we get the right people against the right opportunities. It's going to be blocking and tackling and nothing \u2013 no whiz-bang stuff, but a lot of basics. Frankly we're seeing that sales training is a huge opportunity. There's a lot of just basic things where they'd hired a bunch of people that don't even necessarily \u2013 haven't been trained on the full line of products. It's a lot of stuff that's not pretty, but it collectively creates great performance. And that's the kind of stuff I'm sure Kevin's going to get into. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And a follow-up on Diagnostics. You guys have done a great job, I think, not only with new products but also market share. So I'd be interested in knowing just how much more headroom do you see in terms of share gains, or is it really going to be more about the pipeline? I think you alluded that it's pipeline, but just want to clarify. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: In the U.S., there's probably not a lot of share to keep gaining. We do think there's still some market expansion opportunities. One of the things we haven't talked as much about probably, Isaac, is trying to get more testing done to guideline, where frankly there are more tests that can be prescribed in various situations, and we're trying to get more of that done. The huge certainly market share gains are outside the U.S. When you look at our molecular business, it's still over 80% in the U.S., and I think what we're really excited about is we're really starting to get some traction internationally. Four out of the last five quarters at growth over 20%, admittedly off small bases, but the numbers \u2013 you keep doing that, the numbers start to get much more meaningful. So I think the market share will probably be more outside the U.S. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Isaac, one of the things \u2013 just to kind of build on that, one of the things that we're really pleased with is not only that we continue to place very healthy levels of Panther systems. Actually had a very good quarter both domestically and internationally this quarter again. The revenue per Panther continues to increase, both in the U.S., as well as domestically quite nicely. So it speaks to the power of the Panther system, not only with the existing products but also as we add additional pipeline. And I think the team, as Steve mentioned in the script, has done a great job of cross-selling. But there still is some opportunity there on the sexually transmitted disease menu. And then that that bodes well for the viral loads here in the U.S., which we've got the two HIV and HCV, HPV coming in 2018, and so we feel very good about that business. Operator : We'll take our next question today from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Alex Nowak on for Bill today. Just any initial feedback on Panther Fusion in the international markets, and will the system be FDA approved in time for this year's flu season? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Very positive feedback from Europe, and not likely for this year. We figure that's a 2018-ish approval in the clearance in the U.S. Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. And then at what point do you start training your existing OB/GYN sales force with the Cynosure products? Are you going to wait until Cynosure stabilizes here before introducing these products to your existing teams? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, we're going to basically use referrals, but frankly we want our existing GYN Surgical sales force to be selling a little more NovaSure, frankly, right now. And there continues to be a tremendous opportunity on MyoSure. We're not sure we've figured out yet how big the full market potential for MyoSure is, so they've got a lot of good things they can still be doing while they make references, but we don't want to distract them and get them trying to sell the full Cynosure bag. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. And, Alex, on the incentive program that was just launched this last quarter, it's still early days, but I think very promising in terms of the number of leads that have been qualified through our OB/GYN sales organization into the Cynosure group. And so I think we'll see that continue to be a positive harbinger for future, primarily on the Cynosure side, but that's \u2013 in the near term, that's the leverage that we're looking at, and early results promising. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question today comes from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Steve, I was just - Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Rich. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. How you doing, Steve? I was wondering if you could, on the new RF product that you just filed with the FDA, two questions on that. One, is there a particular order that the surgical indication, aesthetic indication, and I can't remember what the third \u2013 women's health indication are going to come out in, or is this going to get approval for all of them at once? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Well, it will not be all at once. What we're doing is, we're building a great box that will have opportunities to add products to it over time. The initial indications will be aesthetic. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. And can you give us a sense as to like how long in between applications, do you think it'll take to get this \u2013 so that's multiplatform functional? And then the second part would just be is this going to be a worldwide launch, or are you kind of going to wait for the U.S. launch first and then extend it OUS? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: It'll likely be a U.S. launch. Just the way they've typically filed stuff has been \u2013 and we're in the process of changing that \u2013 but largely U.S. first and then internationally. I think in the future they could be more global launches. So we'll be excited about the opportunity. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, and I think \u2013 Rich, this is Bob. I think as you look at the indications, think about it over a course of a year. Operator : Moving right along. We'll take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys, a couple questions. First, Steve, last quarter you talked about Cynosure's core competency being identifying customer needs and finding products to meet them either organically or through external business. And you've talked about some of the organic stuff here. But should we expect you guys to do anything in terms of external or inorganic additions to that business to help maybe drive incremental revenue there? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, I think \u2013 by the way, congratulations on Bartman getting his Cubs ring to you, Brian. So - Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: I need to get one now. Yeah. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: So, yeah, that's right, exactly. I think as it does relate to adding products, we always figured Cynosure will be an opportunity for us to have some inorganic tuck-ins along the way. I would tell you in the nearer term, we see such an opportunity between the product pipeline and also our own need to focus on just getting the U.S. selling organization right up to where we want it to be. Again, not dissimilar to what we encountered here a few years ago when this management team came into this company. So I think that'll be our focus nearer term, and then tuck-in kind of stuff maybe down the road. But I think it'll certainly be a place for tuck-ins. It's a great market, and we continue to love being in the medical aesthetics market, think it's going to be one of the highest growth markets to be in. And out of that will certainly spawn additional opportunities for products or small company things. Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, as it relates to Breast Health, as you move to some of the smaller opportunities, you did talk about incremental time to close, tougher competition, but is there any reason to suspect that in the smaller hospitals or smaller imaging clinics that your share should be any different in terms of the net gains that you saw when you were going after the larger accounts? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: No, there's no good reason to expect that our share should be any different. We've got superior products. Some of those have one-source contracts and some of those kinds of things, but frankly so did a lot of the big institutions where there was even more money on the line. And it comes down to, again, blocking and tackling and great salespeople selling a superior product. It just really is \u2013 as we've been saying for a long, long time, we predicted there was not going to be a cliff when everybody thought there was going to be a cliff. But we said it was going to slow down and be much more flat for a much longer period of time, and that's really how the market's playing out as you go into this segment of the customers. But we are not relaxing our share expectations one bit. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: And I think, Brian, to add to that, as of the end of this last quarter, we still estimate that roughly half of our own installed base is available to be upgraded to 3D, and now with the new products that we will be launching over the next couple quarters, it continues to give us a lot of confidence that they will in fact upgrade. And we think that we will be a net share gainer continued going forward regardless of the type of hospital. Operator : Our next question today comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Just a couple on U.S. Breast Health and Cynosure, and maybe just to clarify and pick up on that last question. So is the retention of your own sockets in the quarter, did that change? So you're still \u2013 when your own sockets come up for renewal, is the win rate for Hologic still the same, or did that shift in the quarter? And then on Cynosure, just to clarify, is there a new range from $235 million to $245 million? And then the follow-up there would just be legacy Cynosure sort of categories \u2013 let's say skin, hair, and tattoo removal, for instance \u2013 versus body contouring. Is there some color you can provide on how legacy Cynosure is doing versus some of the new areas they entered into? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: On the share piece, I think we continue to feel very good that as our sockets, as our gantries come up for renewal, we are doing a very good job on those. We don't win all of them, but we win consistently most, and I would say very close to all of them. And we continue to win competitive users, so that's why I think we continue to be a net share gainer. On Cynosure, I think as we mentioned, we felt very good about the performance in the skin business in the last quarter and feel good about that. And we think there's still opportunities as we get ramped up to help on the women's health side. And the body piece, we saw very good improvement in the consumables, but down on the capital sales. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Although \u2013 down on the capital sales versus prior year - Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Versus prior year. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: But up sequentially versus the prior quarter. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes, (52:14). Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: So we're on the right trajectory, but still work to do there. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Our next question today comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Just have a couple questions from me. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, David. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, Steve, how are you? So one for Steve, and the more important one. Bob, I do want to clarify some things on guidance that I'm kind of unclear on. For the fourth quarter, I'm sort of assuming you have kind of $30 million organic guidance reset; that kind of feels like that's about $20 million of Breast. So Breast would be sort of flattish into the fourth quarter, and $10 million of Cynosure, so Cynosure sort of flattish into the fourth quarter. Is those kind of in the right ballpark? And that gets to the kind of 1.5% \u2013 1% to 2% organic growth for the fourth quarter. I'm just trying to level-set those expectations. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, those numbers are off. The Cynosure number is not flat sequentially. We mentioned that it would be down materially versus last year, which was at the $106 million. So \u2013 and to be clear, we're not expecting Breast to be down that much. So our expectation is that our core business growth is not in that low single digits, the 1% to 2% that you quoted. It's higher than that. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, the other way to think about it, David, just from the way we articulated in the script, effectively the guide-down \u2013 the midpoint of the guide-down is effectively all Cynosure, from what they just delivered this quarter to what we expect them to deliver this next quarter. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: But I guess \u2013 I'm sorry I'm being dense here, but you gave a number for Cynosure guidance. Maybe just give us that number again. The $235 million to $245 million, what is the new Cynosure guidance number? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: We haven't given a new number, but it's lower than that, right? So what we're saying is last year it was $106 million in the fourth quarter, and it's materially lower than that for this year's fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question today comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Chris Lin on for Doug today. I just want to follow up with a Cynosure question. What was the domestic Cynosure, or really the domestic SculpSure consumable revenue growth in Q3? Was this as expected for the established installed base and in line with recent trends? I just wanted to get a sense of the existing domestic customer utilization and ensure nothing has changed with the fundamental market growth rate. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. This is Bob. What I would say is, first of all, that number is off a small base, but the growth rate year over year is very, very high in what I'll call the renewal rate for the PAC utilization in the U.S. So it grew significantly. We don't feel that there's any issue with the market. And ultimately we still believe that we're in the early innings of this market. And there is still lots of room to grow not only in utilization but continued placement of SculpSure products in our current customer base. Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Is it right to think that domestic 3D unit sales can at least remain steady for the foreseeable future? And to be clear, was 3D sales in line with your internal expectations for Q3? Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. They can totally, I mean, be stable, and they were roughly in line. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. They were up sequentially quarter on quarter. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: And I think we see them roughly flattish for Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from Anne Edelstein with Bank of America. Anne Edelstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. So the first one is on the international Breast Health business. Now that that's contributing meaningfully, can you just give us a better sense of what your OUS digital install base is and where your market share stands currently? And sort of what is driving the reacceleration in that business? Is it primarily 2D or 3D? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Anne, we continue to sell both 2D and 3D outside the U.S., and we would expect to continue to do that. Over the last several quarters, it's roughly been about 50-50 in terms of the number of placements of 2D and 3D. The number of units in the U.S. is much higher than it is outside the U.S. It's roughly 2,000 units outside the U.S., 3D units. Our share outside the U.S., it's really market dependent, but we still have plenty of opportunity. It's roughly half of what it is in the U.S. on the digital side. So I think what it speaks to is the new leadership in place working for the dealers in Europe and then around the world just having an increasing focus on better performance, not only with our dealers but bringing in the right leaders and working in partnership with them on tenders, bringing in some additional capabilities like market access and so forth, that are really helping drive screening protocols across the various countries. That's going to take some time, but those are the types of initiatives that we've been investing in over the last 18 months, and it's starting to bear fruit. Anne Edelstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just a quick one. I don't know how much you can say about this, but do you expect any impact from the injunction that you filed against Fuji in the U.S.? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, obviously with ongoing litigation, we can't comment. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Mark A. Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thank you for the question. Steve, you mentioned that there will still be some hiring in the sales force. Obviously the prior quarter there was some attrition in the sales force for reasons that you've outlined. But can you just speak to perhaps the number of sales reps that you may have lost in the prior quarter and how many folks you think you need to hire? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. When I said there's going to be continued hiring, by the way, there's going to be continued hiring in every business that we ever have. It's part of being a growth company. So it's in my DNA that we will be always hiring and expanding our sales organizations. I think a little bit bigger opportunity here in the Cynosure piece as we replace people that had left, but feeling very good about the leadership we're putting in place. Mark A. Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. And I guess, just for clarification, was there sales rep attrition that may have impacted the prior quarter? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes, yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Oh, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about the changing growth profile in the Surgical business, and I realize that you lapped the ThermaChoice boost from last year, but growth in MyoSure, albeit quite strong, wasn't as strong as in past quarters. So can you talk about some of the dynamics in the market? Has competition picked up, or is this just a function of law of large numbers finally catching up to this business? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: You got a piece of both. You know what, I think on MyoSure it is the law of large numbers, as that business has generated \u2013 frankly, it had a lot more 30% and high 20% growth quarters than we ever imagined. Still a 20% number, very healthy and excited. I think on the NovaSure piece, we obviously are going against very tough comps as we had the competitive withdrawal. Having said that, you know what? We'd like to be doing better and think we haven't necessarily maintained as much share as we should have. Operator : Our final question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley, and it's a follow-up. David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Steve, just last one. I would just say, I think shareholders really want the Cynosure guidance number, and they're a little confused they don't have it. But we can take that offline. But, Steve, I want to come back to where you started the call this afternoon. I think investors, what they want at Hologic was this notion that the new tomosynthesis was going to decelerate, they knew you were going to fix the core, and we still get back to sort of that mid-single digit growth profile, even in a world where tomosynthesis is slowing. If you think about the third quarter here, and 2% to 3% growth, it sounds like the fourth quarter is maybe sort of the same 2% to 3% growth, hard for us to get there without the Cyno number. But how do you think about 2018 and the future? Do you still believe that even with tomosynthesis decelerating that this is still a mid-single digit growth business, or is there some transitional period here where it's not mid-single digit growth, it's more like low single digit growth? Thanks so much. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Great question, David. I think as we look to 2018, we feel really good. We're not giving guidance, obviously, but feel really good about mid-single digit. I would absolutely say that. We're going to reaccelerate from, frankly, what is this low third and fourth quarter growth rates. We just reported 3.1% organic growth. Fourth quarter is, if you really play out how that will shake out, I think fourth quarter's probably going to be a little bit better than that, is if you really parse out our guidance and this and that. But we don't like being down in that level, and as we go into 2018 between the pipelines, getting the Cynosure stuff behind us, getting some of the pipeline stuff out of Breast Health, international kicking in, molecular being good, feel very good that we will be a reaccelerating story in 2018. Operator : And with no further questions in the queue, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic Incorporated fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call. My name is Noah, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Noah. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks, then we'll have a question and answer session. Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through November 24. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings release. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year over year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. We posted strong results overall with revenue exceeding our guidance and earnings per share finishing at the high end of our expectations. And we redeployed more than $300 million of capital to buy back shares and retire convertible notes. Our fourth quarter results capped off a very productive fiscal 2017. Over the last 12 months, we made excellent progress toward building a sustainable growth company with emphasis on that word sustainable. In the short term, we delivered solid mid single digit revenue growth, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, as we said we would at the beginning of the year. But at the same time, we took three important steps to solidify our growth profile for the long term. First, we laid the foundations for sustainable growth internationally. Second, we shifted our business portfolio toward higher growth segments with the divestiture of blood screening and the acquisition of Cynosure. And third, we began to launch new products that reflect increasing innovation from our revitalized research and development pipeline. In short, 2017 was a year in which we delivered on our near-term financial commitments and did what we said we would do to build sustainable long-term growth. With that introduction, let's review our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $802.9 million grew 10.5% on a reported basis or 9.9% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of the Cynosure acquisition and the blood screening divestiture, fourth quarter revenue increased 5.0% or 4.4% in constant currency, as all our legacy divisions grew on a global basis. We are pleased with this solid mid single digit growth rate on the top line, which represents sequential acceleration compared to the 3.1% growth we posted in the third quarter. One factor underpinning this acceleration is growing sales of new products, which totaled more than $50 million in the quarter, nearly five times the level of a year ago. Obviously, this is not all incremental growth, but the rejuvenation of our product portfolio bodes well for the future. In terms of geography, international sales drove most of the growth in the fourth quarter. O-U.S. revenue of $189.9 million increased 24.7%, helped by the contribution of Cynosure. Even excluding Cynosure and blood, international sales increased a robust 17.5% as a result of very focused and deliberate efforts that began with new leadership less than two years ago. Reflecting back on early 2016, we described our international businesses as a start-up, and this was a major concern among investors and analysts, one that dominated our conversations with many of you. By the first quarter of 2017, the international business grew mid single digits. One quarter after that, it grew double digits. And this quarter, it grew 17.5%. So while we thought that international would be a double-digit grower by 2018, we've actually delivered on that promise a year earlier than anticipated. Yes, we achieved double digit international growth in fiscal 2017. We hope you remember this success story, a complex one that occurred across divisions and geographies, as you think about the more straightforward efforts we have underway today to build a stronger, better Cynosure 2.0. We'll talk more about these in a moment. In terms of divisional performance in the fourth quarter, we're pleased that growth accelerated in our two largest businesses, Breast Health and Diagnostics, compared to the third quarter. In addition, we believe that Cynosure sales bottomed out and should start to grow on a sequential basis from here. Growth slowed in surgical, but Skeletal reversed recent trends and posted very good results. Now let us provide a little more detail on each of these divisions. Diagnostics has clearly emerged as a sustainable growth driver for the company. In the fourth quarter, excluding the divested blood screening franchise, we posted sales of $273.7 million, an increase of 6.6%. This compares favorably to the 5.4% growth we posted in the third quarter. Fueling this growth again was molecular diagnostics, where sales of $153.5 million increased 13.8%. Molecular sales did benefit from $9.5 million of non-recurring royalty revenue in the quarter compared to $5 million in the prior-year period. But if you back out all these royalties, underlying molecular sales still increased 10.9% globally. The business was also very strong internationally, posting growth of 10.3% against a very tough prior year comparable of roughly 15%. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of double digit growth for molecular internationally. Global growth was driven by the Panther system, our fully automated molecular diagnostics instruments. By the end of 2017, we had shipped about 1,300 Panthers to diagnostics customers with about 800 of these in the United States. Importantly, we actually shipped slightly more Panther systems in 2017, the seventh year after our launch, than we did a year ago. This illustrates the strength of our competitive position and bodes well for future growth. Based on increasing usage of our Aptima women's health assays and our growing menu of virology tests, the average Panther system generated more than $200,000 of assay revenue on a global basis in 2017, nearly a high single-digit increase in utilization per system compared to the prior year. And we expect further improvement in utilization in the future based in part on new assays that will emerge from an R&D pipeline that is healthier and more global than it's ever been. For example, in recent weeks, we received FDA clearance for the first two respiratory assays that will run on our revolutionary new Panther Fusion system. Before we leave diagnostics, we want to mention that while sales of cytology and perinatal products declined slightly to $120.2 million in the fourth quarter, this was mainly due to lower perinatal sales. Sales of cytology products, mainly our ThinPrep liquid Pap test, increased at a low single digit rate as strong international growth offset modest declines in the U.S. We also want to mention that we've been encouraged to see various professional societies and patient groups speak out against the draft USPSTF cervical cancer screening guidelines, which represent bad science. Although primary HPV testing has been FDA-approved for three years, it is rarely used in the United States as studies have shown it can miss nearly 20% of cervical cancers, reversing decades of progress we've made against the disease. As a result, we do not expect these draft USPSTF guidelines will have much effect on our business in the near term. Instead, we believe that co-testing for cervical cancer will remain the gold standard. Now let's turn to Breast Health. As foreshadowed in our August call, several encouraging signs had begun to emerge in this business last quarter, ranging from new products to new indications to increased insurance coverage. And in the fourth quarter, these positive factors continued to build, helping us regain market momentum and extend our leadership position. Global Breast Health sales totaled $300.9 million in the quarter, an increase of 2.4% compared to the prior-year period and a sequential acceleration compared to the 0.9% growth we saw in the third quarter. The U.S. business declined 1.2%, although this was largely due to a tough comp in the prior-year period, when sales increased at a high single-digit rate. International sales grew a strong 20.6%, reflecting the tremendous progress we have made in building a sustainable growth engine through both organic and inorganic means. For all of those who have been concerned about a potential cliff in domestic 3D placements, our results this quarter further prove that we have broken that boom-and-bust cycle based on strategic plans we put in place years ago. In the United States, we had a record quarter of 3D shipments, again, exceeding the 300 mark, based on strong initial uptake of our recently launched 3Dimensions and 3D Performance systems. In addition, we continued to gain market share and our backlog increased, which bodes well for future growth. Importantly, although we have now sold roughly 4,700 3D units in the United States, this still represents just over half of our own installed base. And MQSA data statistics suggest that 3D still represents well less than half the overall market, so we still have many quarters of solid performance ahead of us. At the same time, other growth drivers continue to emerge in Breast Health. In the fourth quarter, service revenue again exceeded $100 million and grew at a mid-single-digit rate. Sales of our Affirm prone table increased nicely. And we also launched Brevera, our revolutionary new real-time biopsy system, which should contribute to growth in 2018. Now let's turn to Surgical, where sales of $104.7 million increased 2.7%, slower growth than we had seen in recent quarters. MyoSure continued to perform well, with sales increasing 17%. And we recently launched MyoSure MANUAL, which will help us penetrate the growing in-office market. NovaSure sales declined 7.2% due to a number of factors, including the annualization of a competitive withdrawal, increasing competition, and some softness in overall surgical volumes. Although our skeletal business is small, we were pleased to see it reverse recent trends and return to growth in the fourth quarter, driven by better portfolio selling, strong performance from our Horizon bone densitometry system, and stabilization of our Fluoroscan franchise. Skeletal sales totaled $24.2 million, an increase of 12.9%. Now let me discuss our new Medical Aesthetics division. Cynosure sales were $81.4 million in the quarter. As expected, this was down significantly from the prior-year period, when Cynosure was standalone company. We estimate that the two hurricanes in the southern United States reduced Cynosure sales by $3 million to $4 million in the quarter, as sales events were canceled and purchase decisions were delayed. We want to make two big-picture points about Cynosure that are very different than today's prevailing discourse among investors and analysts, but they illustrate how we're building this business for the long term and why we are confident that we will succeed and grow in Medical Aesthetics. First, we'd like to remind you why we bought Cynosure in the first place. Medical aesthetics is a great growth market, one of the best in med-tech. By divesting blood screening, where volumes and price are declining and purchasing Cynosure, we fundamentally shifted our portfolio toward higher-growth segments. The many tailwinds boosting Cynosure's market include increasing social acceptance of aesthetic procedures, high levels of disposable income among patients, decreasing reimbursement for physicians that is prompting interest in cash-pay services, improving treatments that minimize patient downtime, and growing interest among younger women as well as men. These tailwinds have been driving market growth rates in the high single to low double-digit range. Our second point is that we are making good progress toward building what we call Cynosure 2.0, which we expect to include the greatest commercial organization that the laser industry has ever seen. This is a bullish comment, especially in contrast to recent results. But we want you to know that our goals are high, and we intend to achieve them. This process starts with great leadership, just as it did with our international business in 2016. We have already put in place outstanding leaders as Cynosure's President and the heads of sales and marketing. We have stopped the voluntary turnover in the field and rehired a handful of high-performing reps. We've instituted new screening and recruiting methods to ensure that new hires share our commitment and values to winning as a team, to winning the right way, and to winning in partnership with our customers over the long term. We have upgraded our structure and compensation programs to ensure that sales reps have the ability to prosper by selling our entire portfolio, which is the broadest in our industry. We've hired new leaders to revitalize the customer experience and build the same kind of customer loyalty that we see in our other divisions. And we are implementing across the division a robust sales model that has been proven to work by Cynosure's best reps. Based on all these factors, we're confident that Cynosure's sales bottomed in the fourth quarter and are poised to grow from here. Not only will we execute better with our existing portfolio of products, we will effectively launch new products such as the submental indication for SculpSure, which is receiving positive early feedback from customers. While we still have a ton of work to do, we are making good progress. As early indicators of this, our international performance remains solid and some domestic sales regions are performing very well. And overall, sales so far this quarter are tracking ahead of their pace in the fourth quarter. We are confident that Cynosure will make steady progress in the coming quarters, like our international business did, and become an important growth driver for the company in 2018 and beyond, like our international business is today. Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me summarize by saying that we posted a very good fourth quarter that exceeded expectations and capped off a productive fiscal year. Not only did we execute against our short-term financial commitments, we made important progress in building a sustainable growth company for the long term by growing international, strengthening our portfolio of businesses and launching new products. I am proud of our team and all that we have accomplished together, and am eager to drive even greater successes in 2018 and beyond. Now I'll hand the call over to Bob. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. I'm going to review the rest of our income statement, cover some balance sheet and cash flow items, and then discuss our financial guidance for 2018. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary will focus on non-GAAP results. As Steve mentioned, we closed out our fiscal 2017 with a strong fourth quarter. Revenue exceeded our guidance and EPS came in at the high end of expectations. During the quarter, we also strategically redeployed capital. And as we head into 2018, we see new growth drivers emerging. With that introduction, let's move down our fourth quarter income statement. Gross margins of 64.1% decreased 160 basis points compared to the prior-year period due primarily to the divestiture of our blood screening business and sales of Cynosure products, which carry a lower margin. However, it's important to note that gross margins improved by about 60 basis points on a sequential basis even if you strip out the royalty income that Steve discussed. Total operating expenses of $275.8 million increased 17.1% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the inclusion of Cynosure expenses. If you back these out, our efforts to drive strong operating leverage continue to bear fruit with operating expenses declining 3%. Our operating margin of 29.8% declined 360 basis points due to product and geography mix as well as the divestiture of our blood screening business. Yet, we continue to maintain one of the best profit profiles in medical technology with multiple levers to drive expansion going forward. And finally, net margins of 17.8% decreased 220 basis points as the negative mix factors just discussed were partially offset by improvements in our effective tax rate. All this led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50, hitting the high end of our guidance range. Now before we move on to our 2018 guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other key financial metrics. First, we had a very productive few months as we continue to optimize our debt structure and allocate capital in accordance with our stated priorities. During the fourth quarter, we took advantage of weakness in our share price to opportunistically reduce our convertible debt and repurchase our common stock. Specifically, we retired $86 million in principal of our convertible notes for a total purchase price of $106 million. In addition, we repurchased 5.3 million of our outstanding shares for a total of $200 million. So in total, $306 million in productive capital deployment. In addition, in early October, we announced two positive changes to our debt structure, beginning with an amended five-year secured credit agreement. Through this agreement, we extended the maturities by two years, increased our financial flexibility and upsized our revolver. In addition, we also issued in early October $350 million worth of senior notes maturing in 2025 at a very attractive interest rate of 4.375%. Together, the larger revolver and the senior notes will provide us with the capacity to retire our remaining convertible notes when they become callable in December and March of fiscal 2018. This quarter was a certainly a very productive one for our financial organizations following on the heels of the blood screening divestiture and the Cynosure acquisition earlier in the year. So I want to take this opportunity to publicly thank the finance teams for all the hard work that made these successes possible. And at the end of the fourth quarter, our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, stood at 2.7 times, slightly below our year ago level despite all the capital allocation activities that occurred in fiscal 2017. And finally, in the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $262.7 million declined slightly compared to prior year as improvements in our base business were offset by the divestiture of blood screening. Now I'd like to cover our non-GAAP financial guidance for fiscal 2018. First, as a housekeeping item, I will make references to organic revenue, which is defined as total revenue less blood screening and Medical Aesthetics for the first two quarters of fiscal 2018. Said differently, Medical Aesthetics is included in our organic numbers for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018. Organic results also adjust for the three fewer selling days in 2018 versus 2017, which we estimate has a sales impact of roughly $20 million. And finally, organic revenue adjusts for the $9.5 million of royalty revenue that we don't expect to reoccur in 2018, which is similar to how we excluded discontinued product lines in last year's guidance. We anticipate fiscal 2018 to be a good year for Hologic overall. At the highest level, we are forecasting continued mid single digit organic revenue growth with faster organic EPS growth. Specifically, we anticipate sales of $3.20 billion to $3.28 billion in 2018 with reported growth rates between 4.6% and 7.2%. Based on recent exchange rates, this translates to constant currency growth of 4% to 6.6% with organic constant currency growth in the mid single digits. As you update your forecasts, we would encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance ranges at this early stage, as we've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. In terms of divisional growth in 2018, our guidance contemplates low single digit growth in Breast and Skeletal Health, mid single digit growth in Diagnostics excluding blood screening, mid single digit growth in Surgical and double digit pro forma growth in Medical Aesthetics. In Diagnostics, molecular should continue to lead the charge behind Panther and an expanded menu including the full suite of virology assays, which we expect to have in the U.S. with the approval of our HPV test around the middle of the fiscal year. We anticipate continued strong international growth in Diagnostics as well, plus $25 million to $30 million of revenue related to the blood screening transition services, which will have little to no benefit on earnings. In Breast Health, growth will be driven by new products like the Affirm prone biopsy system and Brevera, our international business and a growing service annuity. And in Surgical, we expect growth to be driven by continued market expansion efforts behind MyoSure, new products like MyoSure MANUAL, the stabilization of NovaSure and our international business. And in Medical Aesthetics, we expect strong growth from a stabilized and fully productive salesforce and new products, including the submental indication for SculpSure and our new RF platform. Now in terms of profitability, I would remind you that our non-GAAP margin profile in the second half of fiscal 2017 represents a new baseline for the business post blood screening and Cynosure. So from gross margin levels of roughly 63.5%, we forecast solid improvement from continued operational efficiencies tempered somewhat by the rapid growth of our international business. In addition, we expect to continue to show strong leverage in operating expenses. So from baseline of roughly 29.5%, operating margin should expand faster than gross margins. Now below the line, we expect net non-operating expenses to be materially higher in fiscal 2018 than the $122 million we posted in 2017. This will result from higher forecasted interest rates and the refinancing activities I mentioned earlier, which are tied to the anticipation retirement of the remaining convertible notes in December and March. All of this leads us to forecasted earnings per share of between $2.10 and $2.15 in 2018. This represents reported growth of between 3.4% and 5.9% with double digit organic growth after adjusting for the blood screening divestiture. This guidance assumes a full year tax rate of approximately 31% and diluted shares outstanding of about 284 million for the year. Our guidance does not assume any capital deployment beyond calling the convertible notes and excludes the possible reinstatement of the medical device excise tax. Now let's cover guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. As a reminder, we will have four fewer selling days this quarter than we did a year ago, which translates into more than $20 million of revenue. We expect revenues of $775 million to $790 million, down on a sequential basis, as we see a normal seasonal decline due to our global sales meetings and the RSNA conference in Breast Health. In addition, we'll be missing the $9.5 million in diagnostic royalty revenue that Steve discussed. Compared to the prior-year period, which included those extra selling days, this range reflects reported revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.6% and constant currency growth of 4.7% to 6.7%. We forecast non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.48 to $0.50 in the first quarter. This anticipates a decline of 7.7% to 3.8% on a reported basis, but double-digit growth excluding the $0.10 in the first quarter of last year related to blood screening. Before we open the call for questions, let me just conclude by saying that our fourth quarter capped off a successful and productive year for the company. Externally, we are encouraged by the productivity of our R&D investment and a building product pipeline, the impact that organizational changes have made on the international business and the overall shift in our portfolio to higher growth markets. Internally, we continue to exercise tight expense controls, improve our debt structure and strategically redeploy capital. Overall, we feel confident in our foundation heading into 2018 and have the levers to deliver healthy revenue and EPS growth. With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, and then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question today from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. I wanted to ask a couple questions about Cynosure. First off, can you tell us a little bit about why the business declined sequentially and what's going to take it back this coming quarter, just a near-term trend question? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes, why it declined sequentially, if you'll recall, Isaac, we basically changed out the whole leadership team in the July-August time period. So we gave them one quarter after we did the acquisition. Obviously, it wasn't our shining moment, and then we put the new team in. And during the new team, obviously, a little bit more transition. But I will tell you, we also, as you know, we had said we expected a fairly significant decline in the quarter. It was probably a little worse, candidly, than what we would have hoped. But I'll tell you, having just spent a lot of time with their sales organization, their leaders over the last couple of weeks, it's a very different place than it was even 30 \u2013 45 days ago. And so I feel very good about where we're headed, and I feel very confident that we can now declare the bottom, and it's going to get stronger and stronger from here. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just on the forward, you talked about a lot of things that are going to get better in Cynosure. But I'm interested a little bit on the innovation side. The product cycles in this sector tend to have pretty high velocity. They turn over pretty fast. So can you tell us a little bit about what's coming in the pipeline that will help you guys. Will a better salesforce, better management deliver better growth? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, great question, Isaac. And I'd clarify a couple of additions to that. One is we did just get the submental approved right at the end of the quarter, so that will be kicking in for this quarter. We have the RF platform that we've talked about. That is very much on schedule, and I think you will likely see that being launched in early calendar year 2018. And it's very important to note that all the leaders in the R&D organization and all the managers are all intact. So the inside of the company has not been affected, while the outside of the salesforce in the U.S. was. So we have a lot of pockets and stability called the international selling organization, but particularly the R&D organization, very intact. It's a big part of what we loved about this business. They've been great innovators for a long time, and we expect to continue that pace of innovation. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Isaac, this is Bob. The other thing around that pace of innovation is really one of the competitive advantages I think we have is also our clinical profile. And so one of the things with the submental that came out was not only that we got it approved slightly ahead of where it was initially, but also with superior claims to competitive products out there with a wider BMI [Body Mass Index] range and so forth. And so we're thinking about that to be able to have it serve the broadest amount of customers. So there's also that element as well. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Jack. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So I just wanted to pick a little bit more on your conviction in this quarter as the bottom and what's going to get to growth in the fourth quarter. You mentioned regionally in the U.S. some areas are showing strength. Can you maybe just talk matching it up in terms of where the salesforce is a little bit more mature, if that was a trend you noticed? And then just a little bit more discretely, what we should be thinking for the first quarter would be helpful. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, Jack. I think clearly, to your point, we saw pockets of strength. Our West Coast team was largely intact and has delivered actually growth in the quarter. What we had is we had several teams that largely left en masse when the transition occurred, and it's filling those pockets back up. But we know how to do that. We're frankly being \u2013 we're building for the long haul. We could have easily gone out and just grabbed a bunch of people that had left and offered them a bunch of money like this industry typically does just to bring them back, but we're building it for the long haul. So I think what we feel really good about now is we've looked at what has made the regions that are successful doing well and really starting to emulate and pick up from there as we add the people. But this is going to be like international. I know everybody wants to see the immediate turnaround. I just go back. To build things sustainably, it takes a period of quarters. We could easily do a one-hit wonder and go out and just hire some people and slam some stuff through. It's not what we're about. We didn't buy this business for 2017. We didn't buy it for the beginning of 2018. We are building it. And I've got so much confidence in the leaders that we have in place now. And it's a combination of some from the outside and frankly, a lot of real stars that were in the company that are stepping up in the company, being Cynosure, stepping up. So that will give us the sequential improvement. There's just little doubt in our minds that we bottomed out, and we'll build from here. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: And hey, Jack, this is Bob, another couple of points there. So we did have some impact with the hurricanes and the weather related that we obviously don't anticipate happening in the fourth calendar quarter, our first quarter. In addition, submental came in at the very tail end of Q4. We've seen very positive early pickups. We'll obviously have a full quarter of that to be able to sell that, so those are two other additional points that should drive. In the fourth quarter, fourth calendar year quarter, it's typically the highest volume quarter of the medical aesthetics industry. So we've got a number of things here that both from a macro perspective, but also internally in addition to what Steve was saying, that give us some confidence that we will grow sequentially from the fourth quarter, fiscal fourth quarter. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Is there a number or a range that you have in mind for the December quarter? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: I would say it's up sequentially, but still down materially from prior year. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. I'll give you a break from Cyno questions for a minute and maybe just shifting over to Breast Health. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Tycho. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : No problem, I'm just trying to help. How are you thinking about the Breast Health setup for 2018? And maybe if you could just talk a little bit on uptake of the two different products. I'm just wondering about kind of pricing dynamics given you've got a new low-end system and a new high-end system, how pricing is going to settle out, you think, for 2018. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, at the highest level, Tycho, I feel a lot better about where our Breast Health business is headed as we go into 2018 than probably did going into 2017, and certainly materially better than how we felt six months ago. I think our team has gotten their mojo back. And the two new products are really going to help us a lot. What we're seeing is 3Dimensions on the high end is coming off to a very nice reception. And the 3D Performance is probably going to be a little bit bigger than I think a number of our reps felt. And that is going to be at a lower price. But having said that, it's similar margin to our existing business. The greatest part about that is it's allowing us to compete. As you know, some of the big boys are being very aggressive on price. We don't want to get into a price battle. But it does give us a chance to have an offering for some of the smaller hospitals where they don't need all the bells and whistles that come in our traditional Dimensions, you know, 6000, 9000 and then the 3Dimensions. So it really gives us a very good menu of an offering. And I think that really, we already saw a nice uptick there in the fourth quarter in terms of placements. We've also got Brevera coming. Affirm is building. And frankly, if I look at, we don't report orders. But it was a very nice uptick in our fourth quarter orders. And I think just there's a lot of things coming together in that business right now. As you know, we've come a long way and just avoiding the cliff. It's not going to be a super growth business in the U.S. just given how far we've come. Having said that, internationally, internationally is looking very, very good and you can see the numbers there, 20%-ish Breast Health growth internationally. And everybody \u2013 remember, a big part of that growth is Kevin Thornal, who was redeployed to Cynosure. And his first few quarters internationally looked pretty ugly and today, we're in a very different place. And it's what gives me tremendous confidence both about our ongoing Breast Health business, our international business, but also Cynosure. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yes hey, Tycho this is Bob. Just to give a little additional flavor and color. So in our prepared remarks, we talked about having record shipments, over 300. Roughly two-thirds of those were the existing products. So said differently, maybe one-third of those were both a combination of 3D Performance and 3Dimensions. So it talks about the uptake has been very good. And that gives us, as Steve said, the broadest portfolio to really supply and support any customer out there. And so we're really excited about that going forward. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then for a follow-up, just a question on Fusion I guess as we think about installed based of Panthers. Can you maybe comment on what you think the attach rate might look like? And do you have enough out there to maybe make an impact on the flu season this year with the Fusions you do have out there? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: No. I'll answer the second half of the question first. No, we won't have any impact this year on Fusion on the flu season. It just came a little bit late and we still have one more assay that we want to prove. I think it does bode well for next year's flu season. I think the initial feedback from Fusion has been phenomenal. And the magic to me is the fact that we did placed more systems in 2017 than we did in 2016. And it's too early to fully predict an attach rate, but we think it will be very high. And we're seeing just increased throughput. Everybody that gets Panther into their hands likes it. And Fusion is that much more of a game changer. So over time, we would certainly expect the majority of those and hopefully, as we get well into 2018 and beyond, hopefully most of the systems we ship will actually be Panther Fusions as opposed to Panthers. But we'll be basically taking it on a case-by-case basis, whatever is best for our customers. But I think they'll increasingly see the broader value of Fusion as well. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yes, I was going to say just add on to that, Tycho, we've said before that we see Fusion as really being the cornerstone of the lab for the future and our conviction only grows with customer feedback. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I guess, moving on to Surgical, how confident are you in your mid single growth outlook for Surgical? And specifically, what are the plans in place to stabilize the NovaSure product? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, Dan, good question. We continue to feel great about MyoSure and it continues to grow at rates far beyond what we probably would have predicted. We're a little disappointed with NovaSure. Obviously, there was the competitive. We had done a great job turning that business around. Then we benefited from the competitive withdrawal. But I think we might have taken it little easy. Maybe that business came a little too easy to us. And I don't think we've doubled down as firmly as we need to. We have put a new sales leader and some new leadership into that division to kind of step it up a little bit. And we're looking at some comp changes for that salesforce. And I think I put them a little bit of where our Breast Health business was about six months ago where I think they just slightly took their foot off the pedal, and we're are going to get that foot back on the pedal. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: I think with the addition of the new products, MyoSure MANUAL, that will also help continue to propel the MyoSure business, and as that becomes a bigger part of the overall Surgical business, that will drive the overall growth rates as well. So we feel it's still very early days on that. But that will really help us get a stronger foothold into the office-based procedures, which is really kind of virgin territory for us. And so that will help expand that market. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just a quick follow-up on Cynosure, I appreciate the comment that there's no more voluntary turnover in the salesforce. But can you give us at a higher-level kind of how many heads you have on the street today or how many feet on the street versus you were six months ago versus where this business was 12 months ago, so we know how much more additions you need to get that back up to par? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, we are well below where they were a year ago, and particularly in some key regions. So consider that double digit percentages down. And that's where I think as we start to add bodies back into a lot of these territories, and we're doing that now, that that will drive some very nice growth. But we are materially below where they were at this time last year. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Chris Lin on for Doug. Thanks for taking my question. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, Chris. Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: I want to go back to Cynosure. You know that some salesforce left en masse after the leadership change. You also know that the Q4 revenue was weaker than expected. So one, was this the sole driver of the weaker than expected Cynosure performance or do you see any change in the competitive dynamics here? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: No real change in the competitive dynamics, I think. We lost, as we were down people, we've got to put territories back in. There's always little pieces in that business where one company might get a little hotter for a quarter or two, but nothing fundamentally different. Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then maybe for the follow-up question. Sorry if I missed this. But did you, or are the new hires completed for Cynosure now? And I think previously, we talked about a six-month period to get sales reps to optimal productivity. So as we think about the phasing of Cynosure revenue growth in 2018, should we think growth is likely second half weighted for Cynosure? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, I think, hiring is not complete. We're hiring as we speak. And we've got some just great leaders in that business that are talent magnets, so filling those spots. But I think they will be filling through time. We'll start to see some growth here in the coming quarters and I think builds sequentially through the year. I think it will be a big driver of growth in the second half of the year for us. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Chris, this is Bob. When we look at first half, back half, there will certainly would be more growth in the back half of the year as we get that stabilized. As we mentioned, the first quarter we expect that business to be down. We expect growth in the second quarter and beyond. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Down versus year ago but up sequentially. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Versus year, that's correct. Operator : We'll take our next question from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good afternoon. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Raj. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : I'll ask a Cyno question just to keep going on that. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: I figured you'd come with Breast Health. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Well that would be my second question, wholly unrelated, but I'll ask that as well. So you made a comment sort of in mid call about the higher standard in a sense for hiring these folks back, the having them at the value standard in a sense of Hologic. And I guess I'm curious how much of a disadvantage that's proving to be given some of the selling practices in this industry? Are you disadvantaged because you're holding your folks to a higher standard here in aesthetics? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: You know what, I'll say no, and we believe that. Ultimately, I believe you hire great people who can work hard and outwork others, you will win over time. I think all of you know, the medical aesthetics industry has been probably not quite of the same character and values. We think we can do it and we can do it the right way. It may not be as easy, but there is zero doubt in my mind that we can do it. And I'll tell you, the existing Cynosure sales leaders who stayed with us, it's what they want. And frankly, there's a lot that the Hologic name is going to bring to this space that will play out over time. It may not be playing out in the first three, six, nine months. But what we can do for this industry, and I always believe ultimately, you do what's right for the customers, you hire great people and you treat them right and build a more enduring relationship, it will prevail. And that's what we're setting out to do. And again, you may not always see it in the short term, right, it's like athletes can win doing steroids or other things. But ultimately, who is the enduring winner are going to be that people do it right. And that's exactly what we're out to do, and we will do it. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Well, just as a follow-up. And I'm sorry, I won't get to the Breast question. But for my follow-up, I guess just in terms of how we think about the recovery in this business then, as you still have a lot of open spots. But perhaps it's a little harder to get those quality folks in because of the standard. When is this business going to get back to where it can grow to the rates that we thought it could when you acquired it? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. It's not a barrier to hiring quality people, let me be really clear about that. There's lot of quality people who want to come in. It's just not necessarily people with a ton of industry experience. We are getting very good quality people. And I think we see this being back to a double-digit grower in 2018, Raj. So we will deliver that, and therefore it will be accretive to our company growth rate. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. I hate to continue the trend on this. But can you just talk about the accretion that you now expect from Cynosure this year? I think you had talked about $0.10 to $0.15 on a higher revenue number previously. So are you still contemplating that range? And if so, is it because you are seeing additional synergy opportunities, or would you be pulling forward some of those synergies? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes, go ahead Bob. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Brian, this is Bob. At the time of the acquisition, we said that we expected to have accretion of $0.13 to $0.15, and we are still aligned with that, obviously off probably a slightly lower sales base. But we have been able to identify synergies faster and have pulled some of those in. So we're still, and that's what's baked into our estimates right now. Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then as a follow-up, what we've seen in Diagnostics, can you talk a little bit about the components there specifically, how things like your CT/NG tests are doing, any share gains there, growth rates, and then same on HPV? Thank you Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: I think in simple terms, given the growth rate of our molecular business, we're probably not going to go in it assay by assay, but we think they are growing faster than the market and taking market share, particularly in the U.S., but also reasonably encouraged obviously off a much a smaller base internationally. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: The fact that our growth, certainly in the fourth quarter, Brian, the fact that our molecular business grew ex the royalties at a double-digit rate would suggest that we have very strong growth in all of those markets, both CT/GC, HPV and trach. We believe they're growing faster than the overall market and we are gaining share. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, David. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: How are you doing, Steve? A couple quick questions just for me. Maybe, Bob, this is a good one for you. Just thinking about the fiscal 2018 guidance, the range at 2.5 points is almost twice the range of last year. Can you just give us a sense of what's driving the wider range and what are the two or three flex factors? One obviously I think I know. But what are the flex factors that make for a wider range in 2018 versus 2017? And I know you're obviously still guiding to the midpoint, but why the wider range? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yes, a couple of things. To be fully honest, we're still getting our arms around the pacing of the Cynosure business. It's a higher capital business that has a little more volatility, and we're recognizing that fact. So I think that is one of the reasons that we've probably get a broader range than we had historically. We haven't been through a full-year cycle of what that business can do. And I think the fact that as we have that capital component of it, we're trying to recognize that piece. That also is the swing factor, that and the new products. And so the uptake of new products, we probably have more new products in our 2018 forecast than we've ever had. That's a good thing. But it also creates a little more potential for upside as well as some variability in terms of the uptake and so forth. But those are probably the two elements, David. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And at the midpoint of your range, Bob, assuming you're forecasting double-digit Medical sales at the midpoint, then my follow-up for Steve is, Steve, you're still maintaining your synergy guidance, $0.13 to $0.15 for next year, or for this year now. Can you explain the logic of that decision? I feel like given the sales erosion and the size and scale of your primary competitor, this is probably not the year to drive earnings synergies. This is the year to reinvest to get the growth rates turned around. And maybe those two quick follow-ups. Thank you so much. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes, thanks, David. I think you're exactly right. And we won't be silly to chase that to an extreme. But I think what we're seeing is there are more synergies say on the operational side and maybe some on the G&A side while we reinvest in sales, marketing, and R&D. So we're probably getting that accretion in a different way than we might have anticipated. But if we feel we need to spend a little bit more than the base business is delivering, we would certainly contemplate that. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: We've done that in the past and we will do that again. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes, yes. Operator : We'll take our next question from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hi, Rich. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi, how are you doing, Steve? I was just wondering. Is there anything that you're seeing specifically in either the women's related to Cynosure in the women's health markets? And can you comment on your ability to leverage your GYN salesforce there? And then also, is there anything underlying going on, on the body contouring space in the U.S. just given that this is a market that's been developed for a few years now? Is it getting saturated at all on the capital side? Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes, thanks. We still think there's big opportunities on the body contouring side. In the grand scheme, while there's been competitors and products out for five or six years, when you look at the full range of possibilities in the installed base, there's still a lot of opportunity there. On the women's health side, we also think there's much better opportunities, particularly for MonaLisa Touch in women's health than, frankly, what Cynosure had done over its last year as a standalone company and probably what we've done in the first quarter and a half, two quarters of owning it. And we're putting a more dedicated effort into particularly the women's health side. So we also want to be careful not to distract our Surgical organization because they've got two great products and still a lot of growth potential as well. So it's like anything. You find other ways, and I think frankly, it's going to be more through the Cynosure sales organization with a refocus on the opportunity. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : I guess just as a follow-up there, Steve, is that a different strategy than you envisioned when you purchased the asset, whereas you'd need to rely a little bit more on the Cyno build-out within women's health to leverage that channel where you already have a dedicated sales force? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: No, we're still using referrals. What I'd say, our basic approach here is use the GYN Surgical salesforce for referrals to key customers, but have the Cynosure sales reps still close them, but I think building that relationship to be better. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We'll go to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great, thanks and thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. Two questions, I guess first off is just thinking about \u2013 I guess at some point here, we may start to hit a bit of a replacement cycle on tomo. I realize that we're about a little over about 6.5 years out now from the FDA approval. So I guess first and foremost, maybe we can just, I would love your thoughts on when we might start to see some initial replacements. Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, we think we're probably still a few years away from that. And the magic of it, to your point, is we think we've still got probably three to four years of runway with tomo itself still establishing itself into our customers that haven't flipped yet. And by that point, we'll be needing some new revenue and then the early adopters will be starting to come up and it'll probably work out very well that they'll be ready for some new stuff, call it in that 2020-2021 time period. So it should really be key to helping us break this whole boom/bust cycle that really, when you look at it, and I go back two years ago, every meeting we had with investors was about the cliff. And then shortly after that, every meeting was about international. Right now, everyone is about Cynosure. We just keep knocking it up. There's issues that pop up, very proud of what we've done to thwart off the cliff. very proud of what we've done in international. And frankly, we'll be sitting here 12 months from now having shown the same with Cynosure, feel very confident about it. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah hey, and Bill, just to kind of frame in kind of the opportunity, we're still roughly half penetrated into our existing base. And there's still roughly about 65% based on our estimates of the installed base in the market in the U.S. that still has an opportunity to upgrade to 3D. The other thing is we continue to get 3D incremental reimbursement. We now have roughly almost 90% of all women covered for incremental 3D in reimbursement. So there's still a runway there. And then couple that with those, if in fact there is somebody next year which I would think would be the exception certainly not the rule, the 3Dimensions, that high end product would be a perfect opportunity for that early adopter. But we still have a long way to go with the existing products. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Yes, got it. And then maybe just lastly, and Steve you kind of touched on this early regarding hitting the bottom on Cyno and starting to see a recovery here in the calendar fourth quarter. I guess, talk to us a little bit about the strength of why you feel like that. Is this because you're seeing more product getting shipped out to customers? Is it because the deal funnel is getting stronger? Are we seeing less product at resellers, just curious kind of some of the bits and pieces that give you the confidence there? Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. I go back to my, probably my core management philosophy. The reason I feel better is because of the team that we have in place. And we have a better, more engaged leadership team, then the regional leaders under them are strong and motivated. And they lost their way for a little bit earlier this year. They are back, completely reengaged. There's always recency effect, but I was just with the entire sales organization a couple of weeks ago for their national sales meeting. Just hearing comments like, hey, this place is even completely different than it was 30 days ago. We're jazzed. We're ready to go. And it's the leading qualitative factor. And this is where I'll go back to, I think you've heard me say it, sometimes an organization is better than its numbers and sometimes it's worse than its numbers. And I think, but oftentimes, when you're in the midst of changing something out, you can start to see it and feel it qualitatively before the numbers start to show up. Having said that, we are partway into this quarter and we're starting to see some uptick. So I don't want to get into the process of talking about quarterly updates. But because this call is particularly later into a quarter, starting to feel certainly on a better trajectory than where we've been. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. Have a good evening.",

My name is Isaac, and I am your operator for today\u2019s call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Mike Watts : Thank you, Isaac. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks, then we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session. Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our newly redesigned website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived for 30 days. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known as well as unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release, and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic\u2019s CEO. Steve MacMillan : Thank you Mike, and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re pleased to discuss Hologic\u2019s financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We posted solid results overall, and are off to a good start for the year. As we pre-announced at the J.P. Morgan conference, revenue of $791.1 million finished just above our guidance range. And earnings per share of $0.55 also exceeded our expectations based on the benefit from U.S. tax reform. We enjoy unique leadership positions in a range of women\u2019s health markets, and our two largest divisions, Breast Health and Diagnostics, are performing well based on these differentiated products. And we believe Cynosure, our medical aesthetics business, is turning the corner toward a future of consistent growth. Our solid performance in the first quarter demonstrates the two important elements of our strategic plan are paying off. First, our international business, which we described as a start-up and was an area of great concern for investors as recently as 2016, is now thriving. Specifically, core international revenue, excluding the acquired Cynosure and divested blood screening franchises, again delivered double-digit growth in the first quarter. Second, a research and development pipeline that was barren four years ago has now generated new products that are contributing more than 10% of quarterly sales. And as we look to the future, we are particularly encouraged because our international businesses and our R&D pipelines both have the potential to contribute to sustainable growth for a very long time. With that introduction, let\u2019s review our divisional revenue results for the first quarter. As a reminder, growth rates compared to the prior year period were artificially depressed by the fact that we had four extra selling days in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We estimate that these extra days added more than $20 million to sales in the prior year period, with the greatest benefit to our recurring revenue lines in the United States. In the first quarter, revenue of $791.1 million grew 7.7% on a reported basis or 6.7% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of the Cynosure acquisition and the blood screening divestiture, first-quarter revenue increased 2.7% or 1.5% in constant currency. But accounting for the extra days in the prior year period, revenue growth would have been about 6.2% on a reported basis or 4.9% in constant currency, slightly better than the 4.4% organic growth we posted in the fourth quarter. In terms of geography, international was the standout in the first quarter, as we alluded to earlier. International revenue of $193.9 million increased 15.8%, helped by the contribution of Cynosure. Even excluding Cynosure and blood, international sales increased a robust 11.6%, as a result of very focused and deliberate efforts that began with new leadership less than two years ago. In the United States, revenue of $597.2 million increased 4.1%, again primarily due to the acquisition of Cynosure. Excluding Cynosure and blood, U.S. revenue declined by 0.8%, but remember the impact of extra days in the prior year period was concentrated in the United States. In terms of divisional performance in the first quarter, our two largest businesses, Breast Health and Diagnostics, which represent nearly three-quarters of sales, are performing well. Let\u2019s start with Breast Health, where results have clearly improved over the last couple of quarters. We remain the undisputed leader in this market, based first and foremost on the established clinical superiority of our products. No other mammogram has been proven to detect 20% to 65% more invasive breast cancers compared to 2D alone, and no other mammogram has also been proven superior for women with dense breasts. In addition, no other manufacturer has partnered with customers as extensively or as effectively as we have. We help breast centers prosper by referring patients through our direct-to-consumer initiatives, and by fighting for insurance coverage. As a result, we continue to add to our overall market share. Based on all these factors, global Breast Health sales totaled $288 million in the first quarter, an increase of 4.2% compared to the prior year period, and another sequential acceleration compared to the 2.4% growth we saw in the fourth quarter. The U.S. business declined 1% versus the tough comp in the prior year period, which benefited from extra selling days. International sales, however, grew a robust 29.2%, marking our second consecutive quarter with growth over 20%. This performance reflects the tremendous progress we have made in building a sustainable growth engine through both organic and inorganic means, including the recent purchase of our Spanish distributor. In addition, we are seeing good adoption of our new mammography systems, which are called 3Dimensions and 3D Performance. These new products further strengthen our market-leading Genius brand, better segment the market, and encourage customers to upgrade the thousands of 2D systems that remain in the field today. At the same time, we are building a broader portfolio of Breast Health products and services around the core of our Genius systems so that we can play a more significant role in the Breast Health continuum of care. The success of these strategies was apparent in our first quarter results. Our new mammography systems represented almost a third of the systems we sold. And sales of interventional breast products mainly biopsy systems and disposables increased by 16.1% on a global basis. This strong performance resulted from an increased focus on portfolio selling, and an excellent start from our revolutionary new Brevera real-time biopsy system, which we just launched. In addition, sales of our Affirm prone biopsy system, which we introduced a little more than a year ago, continue to build nicely. Now let\u2019s turn to Diagnostics, which remains on a solid growth path. Excluding the divested blood screening franchise, we posted sales of $272.0 million in the first quarter, an increase of 3.3% despite the headwind from additional selling days in the prior year period. Including residual blood screening sales of $12.6 million, which was in line with our expectations, Diagnostics revenue was $284.6 million. Fueling this growth again was molecular diagnostics, where sales of $148.6 million increased 5.3%. The U.S. business remained healthy, growing at a mid-single-digit rate despite the days headwind, while international sales increased high-single-digits versus a difficult prior-year comp. As in recent quarters, global growth was driven by the Panther system, our fully automated molecular diagnostics instrument, and increasing utilization of our Aptima women\u2019s health assays, which have long been leaders in testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV, and trichomonas. We continue to work with our customers to expand the market for sexually transmitted disease testing, providing better healthcare through earlier detection. At the same time, sales of our new molecular diagnostics tests are steadily increasing, although their overall impact remains small. We\u2019re exceptionally proud that over the last six quarters, our Diagnostics business has earned regulatory clearance for seven new products in the United States. These include the first three respiratory assays on our new Fusion platform, and three viral load tests for HIV, hepatitis C, and most recently, hepatitis B. This steady cadence of domestic assay innovation positions us well to consolidate molecular testing on the Panther system. And at the same time, our ability to commercialize new products in various global markets continues to strengthen as well, fueling our geographic expansion. Before we leave Diagnostics, we want to mention that sales of cytology and perinatal products were $123.4 million in the first quarter. This represented a slight increase of 0.9%, as higher sales of perinatal products offset the headwind from more selling days in the prior year period. In cytology, where our ThinPrep liquid Pap test is the clear leader, market dynamics are unchanged despite noise surrounding the draft USPSTF guidelines for cervical cancer screening. While the domestic cytology market is not a growth driver for us, we continue to believe that co-testing will remain the standard of care for women and physicians who want to continue the tremendous progress that we have made against cervical cancer over the last several decades. Now let\u2019s turn to Surgical, which had a disappointing quarter with sales of $107.5 million, down 7.1%. Surgical is primarily a consumables business, so the four extra selling days in the prior year period had a significant negative effect on the year-over-year comparison. In addition, the first quarter a year ago was the single biggest quarter Surgical has ever posted, as we benefited materially from the recall of a competitive product. Nonetheless, we do have some work to do to return Surgical back to a growth trajectory. MyoSure continues to grow nicely, but NovaSure has struggled in the face of increasing competition and a stagnant market for endometrial ablation. We are pursuing a number of strategies to boost growth in Surgical. We put in place new leadership about six months ago, and now that team is upgrading sales talent, structure and incentives. We are fighting back against competition more directly with new products like NovaSure Advanced and MyoSure MANUAL. And we are expanding our efforts to grow the ablation market through increased patient awareness, just as we have expanded other key categories where we are the market leader. Now let me discuss our new medical aesthetics division. Cynosure sales were $91.3 million in the quarter. While this was down significantly versus the prior year period, when Cynosure was an independent company, it was up 12.2% sequentially versus the $81.4 million we posted in the fourth quarter, as we predicted. So we view this quarter\u2019s Cynosure result as a step in the right direction, while recognizing that we still have a lot of work to do to fully capitalize on the potential of the medical aesthetics market, which remains robust. In addition to the in-line quarterly sales number, we are encouraged that our new leadership team has made good progress in filling open sales positions and upgrading our commercial talent. We expect to be largely done with that process this quarter. While it will take time for newly hired reps to complete our re-vamped training program and become fully productive, we are confident that we are moving forward with a highly motivated, talented commercial team that is committed to winning the right way, in long-term partnership with our customers. We also continue to be impressed with the productivity and innovation emerging from Cynosure\u2019s R&D pipeline. As an example of this, we are now launching TempSure Envi, our new radio-frequency platform that minimizes facial fine lines and wrinkles, tightens skin through soft tissue coagulation, and improves the appearance of cellulite. Early feedback from customers has been positive, and over time, we look forward to expanding the TempSure platform into the women\u2019s health and surgical fields. With new products like TempSure, and many more to come, we are expanding what is already the broadest portfolio of energy-based treatments in the medical aesthetics industry. And as we continue to enhance our commercial capabilities in parallel, we are confident that we will demonstrate the scale, stability and strength needed to be the partner of choice for our customers. To wrap up the divisional revenue discussion, Skeletal revenue totaled $19.7 million in the first quarter, a decrease of 7.3%, mainly due to lower Fluoroscan sales. We do, however, expect quarterly sales to improve over the course of the year, driven by better portfolio selling, increasing interest in our Horizon bone densitometry system for body composition testing, and our new mini C-arm product. Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me summarize by saying that our two largest divisions, Breast Health and Diagnostics, are performing well, while Cynosure is on the rebound. Our international business is thriving, and our R&D organization is continuing to churn out new products. These dynamics have us off to a good start in fiscal 2018, and more importantly, they give us great confidence for the future. Now I will hand the call over to Bob. Bob McMahon : Thank you Steve, and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I\u2019m going to walk through the rest of our first quarter income statement, touch on a few other key financial topics including U.S. tax reform, then finish with our updated financial guidance for 2018. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percent changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Steve described, we are pleased with our first quarter results, as revenue slightly exceeded our guidance. In addition, a lower effective tax rate due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform helped us outperform significantly on the EPS line, and will boost our already healthy net margin going forward. We also continued to strengthen our balance sheet, in line with our long-term goals. We essentially retired all our 2013 convertible notes, leaving only one remaining tranche that we plan to call in March, and we are refinancing $1 billion of debt on very attractive terms. With that, let\u2019s jump right into the P&L. In the first quarter, gross margins of 63.8% declined 140 basis points compared to the prior year, due primarily to sales mix associated with the divestiture of the blood screening business and sales of lower margin Cynosure products. Total operating expenses of $271.8 million, increased 17.6% in the first quarter, mainly due to the inclusion of Cynosure costs. Normalizing for the impact of Cynosure, operating expenses in our base business declined at a mid-single-digit rate, reflecting very deliberate efforts to control costs and drive operating leverage. Our operating margin of 29.4% declined 430 basis points due to product and geographic mix, as well as the divestiture of our blood screening business. However, on a sequential basis, our first quarter operating margin improved after normalizing for the benefit of non-recurring royalty payments in the fourth quarter. Interest expense was $36.4 million in the quarter, an increase of 3.4% compared to the prior year period, reflecting the changes we have made to our debt structure in recent quarters. Now let\u2019s spend a moment on tax. In late December, new U.S. tax legislation was enacted into law. Due to our fiscal year end, two provisions of the law immediately affected us. First, the U.S. federal corporate rate was lowered from 35% to 21%, and we are able to apply a blended rate to our U.S. income for fiscal 2018. As a result, we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23% in fiscal 2018, which is significantly lower than the approximately 31% that we previously anticipated. In addition, we performed preliminary calculations and recorded a discrete net tax benefit of $355.2 million on a GAAP basis in the first quarter. This benefit resulted primarily from the re-measurement of U.S. net deferred tax liabilities at a lower corporate tax rate. The second component of tax reform that immediately affected us was the set of changes to the treatment of our foreign subsidiaries\u2019 earnings, and the related tax imposed on the deemed repatriation of historic foreign earnings. We estimate our transition tax to be approximately $26 million. Please note that because of the significant changes to the law, the overall impact of U.S. tax reform is subject to further analysis as the legislation is interpreted and clarified. Finally, net margins of 19.4%, decreased 80 basis points, as the negative mix factors discussed previously were partially offset by improvements in our non-GAAP effective tax rate. All of this led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55, an increase of 5.8% compared to the prior year, and exceeding our guidance range due to the benefits of tax reform. If you were to exclude the impact of our divested blood screening business, non-GAAP EPS would have increased in the high-20% range. Before we move on to guidance, I\u2019ll quickly touch on a few other key financial metrics. In recent months, we have continued to make good progress on our long-term goal to strengthen our balance sheet. In the first quarter, we further reduced our convertible debt by eliminating $241 million in principal, and in January we also announced that we would call the slightly more than $200 million that\u2019s remaining. So by the time we have our next quarterly call, we will have eliminated more than $1.3 billion in convertible debt from our balance sheet over the past few years. Pretty impressive accomplishment, and a testament to our underlying financial strength. At the same time, we have made other positive changes to our debt structure to capitalize on favorable market conditions. Specifically in mid-January, we announced a private offering of $1 billion in senior notes. $600 million of these notes bear interest at 4.38% and mature in 2025, while $400 million of the notes bear interest at 4.58% and mature in 2028. These proceeds will be used in mid-February to refinance our $1 billion, 5.25% senior notes due in 2022. So based on our strong financial position, we are able to both reduce interest expense and extend our debt maturities. At the end of first quarter, our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, stood at 2.6 times, within a comfortable range for us. The net debt calculation includes cash and equivalents of $664.4 million. This is higher than in recent quarters as we prepare to retire our remaining convertible notes. Finally, adjusted EBITDA of $258 million in the first quarter declined 4.1% compared to the prior year, as improvements in our base business were offset by the divestiture of blood screening. Now I\u2019d like to shift gears and discuss our non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and second quarter. We are updating our guidance based on our solid first quarter results and the beneficial impact of U.S. tax reform. At a high level, we are reiterating our full year revenue guidance and increasing our EPS forecast. Let\u2019s start with revenue. Based on our solid first quarter results, we are maintaining our original revenue guidance of $3.20 billion to $3.28 billion, with reported growth rates between 4.6% and 7.2%. Based on recent exchange rates, this translates to constant currency growth of 3.9% to 6.5%, and organic growth in the mid single-digit range. As a reminder, we are defining organic revenue as total revenue less blood screening and Medical Aesthetics for the first two quarters of fiscal 2018. And as discussed last quarter, organic revenue growth also adjusts for fewer selling days in 2018, and the non-recurring royalty revenue. Now let\u2019s turn to the impact of U.S. tax reform for fiscal 2018. We are updating our full year non-GAAP tax rate guidance to approximately 23%, down significantly from an initial forecast of approximately 31%. As we discussed early in January, we do plan to reinvest a portion of the benefits from tax reform to future growth initiatives. These initiatives are likely to include discrete marketing campaigns in areas like Medical Aesthetics and Surgical, as well as investments to speed up or initiate R&D projects. Even with that reinvestment, we are increasing our full year EPS guidance substantially, to a range of $2.22 to $2.27, up from a prior estimate of $2.10 to $2.15. Our updated EPS guidance adds $0.12, or roughly half the savings from our updated effective tax rate, to our previous earnings estimate for the year, and results in reported EPS growth of between 9.4% and 11.8%. This updated full year guidance is based on diluted shares outstanding of roughly 283 million for the full year. Tax reform also should be beneficial to our cash flows overall. For this fiscal year, we now expect free cash flow in the mid $600 million range, not including the one-time tax recapture associated with retiring our convertible notes. Now let\u2019s turn to guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect revenue of between $770 million and $785 million, which reflects growth of 6.5% to 8.6% on a constant currency basis, and reported revenue growth of 7.6% to 9.7%. We expect quarterly revenue to be down slightly versus the $791 million we posted in the first quarter for a few reasons. First, we expect revenue from our divested blood screening business to decline sequentially, probably to around half the first quarter level. Second, as a reminder, the March quarter is seasonally weaker than the December period for both our Surgical and Medical Aesthetics businesses. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.53 to $0.54 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This forecast implies reported EPS growth rates of between 6.0% and 8.0%. As you update your estimates, we would again encourage you to model around the middle of our guidance ranges, as we have incorporated both upsides and downsides into our forecast. Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019d like to conclude by saying that we are pleased with our start to fiscal 2018. We began our fiscal year with quarterly revenues that slightly exceeded our guidance. In addition, recent U.S. tax reform has provided us with an opportunity to both bolster our earnings and opportunistically reinvest in the business to drive growth. With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our first question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro : Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. A question for you on market share in both Breast Health as well as Diagnostics. I\u2019m curious, you have a major competitor on the Breast Health side that\u2019s going through some changes. Curious if you thought you gained any share in that business this quarter, and you had said you think you might perpetuate that for the rest of the fiscal year, I\u2019m curious. And then as an addendum to that, I\u2019m curious in Diagnostics if there\u2019s anything meaningful on the share side for cytology in FE. Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Sure. Thanks, Isaac. I think in Breast Health, yes, I think we just continue to feel that we\u2019re doing very well on an overall share basis. I think we \u2013 one of our key competitors, I think it looked like they might have had a half decent quarter earlier in the year and gained a little momentum. I think we\u2019ve pushed that back and just continued to gain a hugely disproportionate share in 3D relative to our overall market share. So I think we just continued to feel great. Nothing obvious from any of the disruption over there. I think on the cytology front, again as well, we just continued to strengthen our shares. We\u2019re so strong there. I don\u2019t think much additional movement up, but feeling really good about where we are in both of those areas. And as you know, obviously, in Breast Health, we like that strong position and feel like it\u2019s going to continue to help us leap forward. Bob McMahon : Hey, Isaac, this is Bob. I think in addition to that, in addition to the U.S., obviously with the strength that we\u2019re seeing in our international business, that\u2019s being driven by our Breast Health business. So we also believe that we\u2019re gaining share internationally there as well. And that we believe that, that will continue to be a strong growth driver for us, not only through the rest of this year, but beyond. Isaac Ro : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Just a follow-up on the Aesthetics business. Obviously, that\u2019s an area that people remain very focused on. And you called out the seasonality year-on-year despite the easy comp as a sequential decline there. But I\u2019m just curious, kind of we put in the numbers aside for a minute, can you just give us an operational update? There\u2019s been some leadership change. I\u2019d be interested in sort of what\u2019s going on behind the scenes to kind of, over the long term, drive better performance. Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Sure, Isaac. You know what, I feel so great about the leadership in place. And we just had our global leadership team together for the last couple of days for all of our businesses. And I think if you look at the presidents we have sitting around that table, everybody has so much confidence in the team, particularly, that we\u2019ve put in place in Cynosure. And again, you look at the international Breast Health numbers that we\u2019re posting right now, and you are with us on the journey, you know where we stood six, seven, five, eight ago in international Breast Health. That was Kevin Thornal. Kevin went in the first few quarters of Europe. We\u2019re still weak when he went over there in Breast Health. And today, it\u2019s thriving. And Kevin is doing the same magic with the Cynosure business. We\u2019ve got a great VP of Sales. He\u2019s rebuilding the team. We\u2019ve got all the strength of the folks that have stayed with us. And I think it\u2019s really going to be a more magical team as we go forth. We\u2019re in that classic scenario, and you\u2019ve heard me say it before, where sometimes, the numbers are better than an organization; sometimes, the organization is getting better than the numbers. And I think we feel really good that, that organization right now is getting better than the numbers and starting to see that, certainly some progress here in the last quarter. I think it\u2019s just going to play out over the course of this year. But I think we just feel so much better. We\u2019ve got TempSure coming out the door. The folks we\u2019ve got in that organization today, really excited and building for the future. Operator : And we\u2019ll move to our next question from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to start in the molecular side. So I was hoping you can give an update on the Fusion system in terms of placement adoption and just thoughts on how customer utilization has changed, either with the LDT as a respiratory there. Steve MacMillan : Sure, Jack. We are in that very, very early stages of actually placing Fusion. We\u2019re in the de minimis numbers at this point, just starting to get it out there. So I think \u2013 and even with the flu and respiratory stuff, obviously no impact yet this year. We got it out too late. So as we go into next year, I think that will start to be in effect. Now having said that, respiratory in molecular in the big labs is still a fairly small business. But we really like what Fusion is going to do, less over the coming quarters and more over the coming years. Bob McMahon : Yes, and I think, Jack, while the end is small, certainly, customer feedback has been incredibly positive. And so we\u2019re actually very excited about that for the long term. And again, it\u2019s probably less a growth driver for 2018, but it sets us up very nicely for 2019 and beyond. Steve MacMillan : Yes, very much. Jack Meehan : Great. And just in terms of the full year guidance, last quarter, you gave segment-level thoughts. Do you think those ranges still hold today? Or are there any pluses and minuses in your mind? Bob McMahon : Yes, I think we\u2019re not going to get into the habit of giving that every quarter. I think given our first quarter, maybe I feel a little less good about the Surgical business, maybe a little better about Breast Health. I think everything else is probably in line. Operator : And we\u2019ll move to our next question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson : Thanks. Bob, having said that, I\u2019m going to ask about segment guidance. Just on Cynosure, I mean, you previously talked about double-digit pro forma growth for the year. I just want to make sure that, that is still on track. And can you maybe talk, I guess, on pacing, given the seasonably soft second quarter, I mean, what we should expect in the back half of the year and contributions from the new product as well, from TempSure? Bob McMahon : Yes, we\u2019re probably not going to give product-level detail there. I mean, we feel really good about TempSure. As we\u2019ve said before, we expect strength growing throughout the course of the year with Cynosure, and the second half of the year, we would expect to be stronger than the first half of the year. We are fighting against a seasonality in the first quarter \u2013 in the second fiscal quarter, where, typically, that is lighter. And so the positives are our sales organization is getting stronger as well. And so the question \u2013 and as well as launching the new product. So the question is how much of that is going to be able to overcome that, but certainly feel good about the progress that we\u2019re making. Tycho Peterson : All right. And then, Steve, on NovaSure, you\u2019ve talked about new leadership, new sales force comp, restructuring that a bit. And that was just some of the new products. I guess where are you in the turnaround of that business? How much of it is operational and organizational versus just a function of getting these new products out to try to turn the growth around there? Steve MacMillan : Yes, great, Tycho. I\u2019d say we\u2019re in the late early innings in the turnaround. I think we\u2019ve got a couple of more quarters, candidly, probably of some Surgical softness as that team really rebuilds it. But I think we exit this fiscal year in a good trajectory for that business. We\u2019ve been making key leadership changes within that organization and have actually moved pretty quickly. I think we got a little fat, dumb and happy when we had the competitive withdrawal. It\u2019s the reverse of what I said earlier. Sometimes the numbers look better than the organization, and sometimes the organization looks better than the numbers. I think our Surgical business looked \u2013 the numbers were better than the organization a year ago. And now we\u2019re reversing that, much as we\u2019re doing with Cynosure, to build for the future. But I think a couple of more quarters before we\u2019re really back where we want to be. Operator : And we\u2019ll move to our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead. Steve MacMillan : Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe I\u2019ll start off one high level, Steve, on the geographic, U.S. versus OUS. So in the quarter, U.S. GYN, Breast, they were down. Diagnostics was little singles, right? So as you think about U.S. versus OUS, what could turn around some of these, I guess, growth rates in the U.S., right? Because GYN, I think on the converter front, maybe there\u2019s a little bit of headwind, and Breast, just given where we are in the penetration level and the converter dynamics, I\u2019m just trying to understand what changes that view of dynamics. Steve MacMillan : Sure. Remember, Vijay, that most of the impact on the U.S. numbers this quarter was the four fewer selling days versus last year. That was clearly accentuated in the U.S. and especially in those disposable businesses. I think, on the core, we feel good about what our molecular business is doing. If you days-adjusted that in the United States, I think you\u2019d have \u2013 it would have been very much high singles, possibly borderline double digit. So some very good underlying performances there. I think Surgical was clearly weaker, and that was going against both the big comp and fewer selling days. But as we said, we got some work to do there to strengthen that. So I think the good news, as we look at it, is Breast Health, Diagnostics, our two largest businesses, both in the U.S. and globally, performing well. And we really do think we\u2019ve got international on a sustainable growth rate that really is pushing that double-digit number that we\u2019ve been aspiring to, as you know, for a while, and we\u2019ve now delivered it a number of quarters in a row and expect to continue that. Bob McMahon : Yes. Hey, Vijay, this is Bob. Just to put some numbers to it. As we said in our prepared remarks, the extra days were slightly more than $20 million in Q1 of last year, and the significant majority of that was in the U.S. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful Bob. And maybe, Bob, one on the guidance for second quarter. It looks like it was $6 million to $15 million below where the Street was. Is that all coming from a delta versus how the Street had modeled Cynosure? Or was this maybe a little bit of softness on GYN? Any comments, I think, would be helpful. Bob McMahon : Yes, I think, as we said in our prepared remarks, the kind of sequential decreases is really probably a couple of things. The first and foremost is the blood screening business and how that was \u2013 how we\u2019re looking at that. And there is some seasonality in Surgical and in Medical Aesthetics. We have seen early in January, some combination of kind of the bad weather and the flu, somewhat impacted, and you\u2019ve heard that from some of our customers. But primarily, if you look at quarter-over-quarter over the last several years, our second quarters been in line roughly with the first quarter. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard : Thank you. I\u2019ll start with a question on Cynosure. Can you give us some color and context around your positioning and competitive environment with SculpSure? And I ask because it looks like you were sequentially up in Cynosure in every business but body, which I assume is mostly SculpSure. Steve MacMillan : Dan, I think that\u2019s our bigger challenge that we\u2019re in the midst of, I think, taking some very good actions to fix. But I think, last year at this time, they certainly sold a whole bunch in, frankly sold some to some customers that probably didn\u2019t really know how to use the product as effectively, and we\u2019ve been unwinding that and really focusing now on how we build it for the right path. I think the positive is, I think we\u2019ve really gotten our hands around that. At this point, our understanding of our organization is totally on top of it. And in the meantime, I think the real nuggets that show we\u2019ve got some good things going are the growth in both women\u2019s health as well as skin. And I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re starting to see some real traction that the new organization knows what\u2019s it\u2019s doing and frankly, quietly, very bullish about what we may be able to do with MonaLisa Touch, which is \u2013 could be a key leverage point for us as we also rebuild and restore SculpSure to its rightful place. Dan Leonard : Thank you. And then for my follow-up. Possible if you could elaborate a bit on the reinvestment in R&D of U.S. tax reform dollars. Are we talking about acceleration of menu expansion on Panther? Or are there projects within Cynosure you\u2019re going to accelerate? Any further color will be helpful. Steve MacMillan : Sure, we\u2019re really looking at it both R&D and marketing and really across division. So what we\u2019ve done is each division has put forth a list of some things. And I would say, it really is fairly, I wouldn\u2019t say balanced, but fairly spread across the various businesses. And it\u2019s a project tier there that we might be accelerating by 6 months or something else we might get started on a little bit earlier as well as some additional marketing activities to help drive the overall category demand for a number of these categories where we\u2019re the market leaders. So nothing that\u2019s going to dramatically affect revenue in 2018 but I think the kind of stuff that will probably start to show up in 2019 and beyond. Operator : We\u2019ll move to our next question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Bill Quirk : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon everybody. Steve MacMillan : Hey, Bill. Bill Quirk : All right. So first off, I was hoping if you could just help us think a little bit about the sales cycle for Brevera and Affirm. And then I certainly appreciate that we\u2019re still pretty early here, particularly around Brevera, but how high or maybe help us think about kind of where we could get in terms of penetration within some of your existing accounts? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Sure. First off, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t say that I\u2019m very pleased how my Eagles performed in your hometown during the Super Bowl. And I think Brevera is off to a good start. And Mike Watts is shaking his head. But I think it\u2019s really interesting. If we\u2019re brutally honest with you, Affirm, that we launched, call it, a year, 1.5 years ago, got off to a slightly slower start than we would have hoped. And yet Affirm is doing very well now. And I will tell you, people NT who runs that business for us, and we really dug in. What we realized is we hadn\u2019t really launched any non-mammography products in a long time in Breast Health. And this is back to a cultural piece as you start to see where we are in our organizational maturity. While Affirm didn\u2019t get off to a great start, but is thriving today, we learned a lot about that and applied it to the Brevera launch, which is just getting more familiar with, getting it in front of the Capital Committee sooner, and Brevera really has come out of the gates humming. And the great part about Brevera, unlike Affirm, is Brevera brings a very strong disposable stream. So the more we get these Breveras placed today, it\u2019s going to create that ongoing revenue stream that we feel really good about. In terms of full penetration levels, I mean, some of that, probably I\u2019m not ready to fully figure that out, but it\u2019s a game-changing technology that, frankly, I think every hospital should end up certainly with a Brevera in their suite. Bob McMahon : Yes, what I would say to add to that, Bill, just to give maybe a little bit more flavor, the life cycle of an Affirm Prone Biopsy table is longer than a life cycle of a Brevera. Steve MacMillan : Yes, and the bigger strategic piece is, this gets back to as we\u2019ve been saying, we\u2019ve got this great installed base in mammography. How can we build around that and create, a, more revenue and more recurring revenue, and Brevera is sort of one of the perfect examples of the kinds of things we want to be doing here. I think it\u2019s going to really help us. It goes back to breaking that huge cliff that everybody was so worried about a couple of years ago. Bill Quirk : That\u2019s great. And of course, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t congratulate you on the Super Bowl. So congrats on that, Steve. Glad hear that you guys enjoyed the tropical weather that we brought in for the game. This is just a quick follow-up. Just thinking about PAMA and potential bleed-through in terms of hospital pricing pressure on the manufacturers. My understanding of the economics in chlamydia and gonorrhea suggest you probably are not going to see much pressure, but I\u2019d be curious about your thoughts there. Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Sure. We always worry about the pressures, and PAMA is another one of those many things we deal with. I think the biggest piece of it that we feel good about is we\u2019ve been partnering increasingly, especially with our largest customers, in helping to drive the categories and expanding the categories and getting more testing. And through a combination of both, our OB/GYN sales force is detailing as well as increasing outreach to \u2013 through some direct-to-patient, really, education around things like, \u201cyes means test,\u201d and a lot of the things we have going on and co-testing and things like that. So I think our major lab partners are seeing that we\u2019re not just a vendor. We\u2019re more than that. And we\u2019re really helping to grow the overall categories and drive their business as well as our business and frankly, improving public health. So I think we\u2019re in a pretty good spot there, not to say there\u2019s always going to be pressures, but I think we can \u2013 our efforts will help us fight through those. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Chris Lin : Good afternoon. This is actually Chris Lin on for Doug today. I just want to start with a question on Surgical. So days clearly had a pronounced impact on Surgical sales, adjusted for days and recognizing that there was a difficult comparison. How did MyoSure perform relative to your expectations in the quarter? And just building off that, for the full year, do you still expect MyoSure to grow at a double-digit rate? Steve MacMillan : Yes, I think MyoSure was in line, and we would certainly hope and expect it to still be a double-digit grower for the course of the year. Generally, we want to be careful not to give too much product line detail, but we feel pretty good about that product continuing to thrive. Bob McMahon : Yes, Chris, as we said, Surgical was one of the ones that was probably most impacted by the days as well given it\u2019s the consumable side of the business. But I agree with you, Steve. Chris Lin : Okay. And then maybe could you just also give us a sense of how interest has trended for the viral load assays from your existing customers in the U.S. And then just how much of a focus is there from the sales force to go after that opportunity now, and could you accelerate the efforts with the tax savings? Steve MacMillan : Yes, I\u2019d say the first piece is we\u2019re in such the early days. The hep B was just approved. So we\u2019re literally just training up the sales force and getting that rolling. And I think this is one that we think, just given the way contracts expire and allow lockups and everything else, it\u2019s going to be a slow build. But we\u2019ve always thought about the virals as really being \u2013 increasing drivers in 2019 and even more in 2020 as they build up. So I think, in a lot of ways, just we feel great about what those will bring for the future. So sales force, early on, wouldn\u2019t expect any tax reform piece to be affecting those at all right now. Bob McMahon : Yes, I agree. And in addition to that, Chris, just as a another side, the utilization of our Panther systems continues to grow on a global basis. And I think the benefits of the Panther system will really help drive the adoption of the viral loads over time. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Lewis : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, one for you, and then a quick follow-up for Bob. Steve, it feels like \u2013 I appreciate the targeted initiatives to improve the relative growth rate in Surgical, but it sort of feels like the sales force needs maybe another product to sell. So to what extent can that product be MonaLisa, and how much of it is the priority to potentially add that third product through M&A? And then a quick follow-up for Bob. Steve MacMillan : Sure, David. They certainly would benefit and can benefit from a third product. The flip side is we think they can be doing a better job with the two that they have right now, and it always becomes the easy answer from an underperforming salesperson to say they need more. And yet, our top people, frankly, still are finding more opportunity. So there are opportunities. I do think, to your point with MonaLisa Touch, I think there will be some opportunities more for, frankly, cross-referrals than necessarily having them sell it directly, but I think working in a little closer partnership with the Cynosure sales to open some more doors, and we\u2019re just starting to see some of the early successes there. Having said all that, to your big point, Surgical is absolutely an area that we could use another product and is on the lookout for tuck-in acquisitions. So I would hope, over the coming years, we will be able to broaden that product line to your exact point. David Lewis : Okay. Thanks Steven. And Bob, just a quick kind of clarification or question on tax. So number one, the 23%, 24%, I mean, is that a fleck where you see the new kind of statutory rate for the business? Or do you think that\u2019s conservative in light of some of the complexities that you sort of called out around the reform at this early stage? And then also, if I think about your implied reinvestments, I think it\u2019s $30 million to $35 million. Is it really realistic that you could put that money to work in the back half of the year? Bob McMahon : Yes. Hey, David, yes, on the first question regarding the 23%. We feel pretty good about that, and that\u2019s our best guess right now. So I don\u2019t envision it changing too much throughout the course of the year. And regarding the investment, yes, you\u2019re roughly in the ballpark, and I think given some of the opportunities that we have, obviously, we\u2019re going to be disciplined. But we do think that we can use that money to invest, particularly in things like marketing efforts and so forth, to strengthen the business for the long haul. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Anthony Petrone : Thanks. One on Cynosure and one on Panther. On Cynosure, maybe just a recap of where the sales force build is at this point, where you expect it to sort of peek out at. And how many of those reps right now are in training, and when will that be complete? And then I\u2019ll have a follow-up on Panther. Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Sure. As it relates to Cynosure, I\u2019d say in the hiring process, we\u2019re easily into the sixth, seventh inning and feeling really good about numerically. And a number of them have been going through training. Most of the hires actually have recently been trained. And I think it\u2019s where we feel really good about where we\u2019ll be in the coming quarters. But they don\u2019t go out and hit the street day one and immediately be productive. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been saying here, we figure we\u2019d exit this year, our fiscal year, which is the July to September quarter. I think we ought to be in great shape by that point and again, building nicely between now and then. The team getting much, much stronger. Anthony Petrone : A follow-up on Panther. Just curious to \u2013 you have the full viral load out there, and it looks like the portfolio is really extending. You\u2019re looking more toward 2019 for a benefit. Just curious on the competitive front, I mean, does that bake in some conservatism for, let\u2019s say, Abbott, Alinity in particular? Anything of note from that competitive launch? Steve MacMillan : We\u2019re always going to be probably a little conservative as we think about the ramp ups to some of these things. And most of the Diagnostics products really do take time. Having said that, I think we feel great about Panther and the opportunities to put more on Panther\u2019s, including the virals, should be very beneficial for us here over time. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Please go ahead. Brian Weinstein : Hey, guys. Can you hear me? Steve MacMillan : Hey, Brian. Brian Weinstein : Hi, Steve, I thought you might have cancel to attend the parade today, but I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re still doing the call. So thanks for that. Steve MacMillan : It was actually on the TV and Mike Watch\u2019s office, because it was better for him to watch that because it was worse to watch CNBC at this point. Brian Weinstein : I get that. Hey, so a couple of questions first. Recent MQSA looks like it\u2019s down over the last couple of months. So can you just talk about the difficulty potentially in sort of pushing through this middle point of the adoption cycle here? And anything else that you guys think you need to do? Obviously, you have new products going in there. But is it just more difficult to push through this, and is that where we\u2019re starting to see a little bit through some of these MQSA data? Steve MacMillan : I think it is much as some seasonality here more than anything, Brian, over the last quarter-ish on the MQSA stuff. The MQSA stuff also, there\u2019s some swirly stuff in some of those numbers. So as we try to reconcile them, I\u2019d put it as directional at best. But I think fundamentally, between our 3Dimensions, our 3D Performance, we\u2019re feeling pretty good, and I think especially the 3D Performance, as an ability to kind of continue to help push through this cycle. So we\u2019re not detecting any material downturn in the market as we hit the state. Is it getting harder to \u2013 and requiring more work as you get further out in this \u2013 in the curve? Absolutely. But I think, frankly, it may even benefit us given our strength and our commitment and our resolve in this category as well as the benefits we\u2019re bringing. So I probably feel, as Bob said, incrementally even better today about our Breast Health business than we did six months ago, both \u2013 and really both domestically and internationally. Bob McMahon : Yes, I think to build on what you\u2019re saying, Steve, I think one of the things that the team has done is really just portfolio sell. So it\u2019s not just about converting a gantry or a mammography machine. It\u2019s the Affirm Prone Biopsy System, it\u2019s the Brevera system there. And we believe that all of those are best-in-class. And so that really helps that portfolio sell throughout the course of the sales replacement cycle. Brian Weinstein : Okay. Great. And then I don\u2019t know if you guys hit this or not, so I apologize if you did. But did you kind of give any idea on rough breakout for Cyno between U.S., OUS and what those different geographies are growing at, at this point? Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Great. We\u2019re not going down at that level of detail. But I think we continue to feel \u2013 international has been relatively strong, and it\u2019s been the U.S., it\u2019s been the larger rebuild. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Richard Newitter : Thanks for taking the questions. I had a couple on TempSure, Steve. With this product, could you just give us a sense of who you\u2019re targeting? Is this more of a core focus product, especially with the initial indication seemingly more on kind of the face and the reduction in the appearance of cellulite? When can we expect the new indications for Surgical and women\u2019s health? And then, historically, with Cynosure, in the first year of a launch of a new product, non-invasive set notwithstanding, they had generated anywhere from $20 million to $30 million in their first year of sales for a new product. Once you\u2019re kind of a up-and-running with your sales force kind of exiting the next quarter, is that something that we should kind of expect for this product? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Sure, I think the \u2013 clearly, the initial customer base for TempSure as its launching now is definitely much more the core cosmetic and derm audience, where we\u2019ve always had a lot of strength as well. In terms of specific product-level guidance, I\u2019m probably not going to go there. But I don\u2019t think those numbers are wildly out of range, but we don\u2019t want to get down to quite that level. As you can see, we\u2019re trying to provide more detail than certainly what Cynosure used to provide as an independent company. Well, we\u2019re not going to go down to individual product stuff. Bob McMahon : Yes, Rich. And in regards to the additional indication, those will come over time throughout the course of this year and the first half of next year. Richard Newitter : Okay. And maybe just one follow-up. Any statistics or metrics you can give us on the utilization of the SculpSure systems, how that\u2019s been trending? Steve MacMillan : It \u2013 truthfully, it\u2019s varied by customer. We have some that are doing really well and others, candidly, that I think where we sold it in and didn\u2019t have the follow-up, and those are the ones we\u2019re going back and working to improve now. Bob McMahon : Yes, and what I would say, Rich, is that the PAC key revenue continues to grow year-over-year, but still a lot of long way to go. Operator : And thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. Have a good evening.",

Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is James, and I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I'd now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, James. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Hologic second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today, then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our newly redesigned website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived for 30 days. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic CEO. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us to discuss Hologic's financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Our results were solid overall. Total revenue finished above our guidance range, and earnings per share met our expectations. On the other hand, we are writing down the value of Cynosure and lowering our annual revenue guidance based mainly on a reset of expectations for that business, which we'll discuss more in a moment. As a quick overview of our second quarter results, revenue of $789.3 million grew 10.3% on a reported basis, or 8.3% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of the Cynosure acquisition and the blood screening divestiture, both of which occurred in the second quarter of last year, revenue increased 4.8%, or 2.6% in constant currency. This was in line with the assumptions underpinning our last guidance. In terms of geography, our international business again demonstrated robust growth in the second quarter. International revenue exceeded $200 million for the first time and increased 28%, helped by the contribution of Cynosure. Even excluding Cynosure and blood, international sales increased 15.1%, with broad based strength across our various divisions and regions. In the United States, revenue of $588.5 million increased 3.3%, again primarily due to the acquisition of Cynosure. Excluding Cynosure and blood, U.S. revenue was basically flat. In terms of divisional performance, our Breast and Skeletal businesses performed well in the second quarter. Diagnostics sales were a little soft as anticipated as we believe fewer women had regular checkups in January and February due to weather and the severe flu season. Surgical sales declined again in the quarter, as expected, although we are seeing early signs of improvement. As for Cynosure, the business is stronger today than at any point since we bought it. But at the same time, it's now clear that given the almost complete rebuild we've had to do with the U.S. sales force, we will not meet our original expectations for the business. As a result, we booked a significant write-down this quarter and are resetting our short-term revenue expectations, while maintaining the firm belief that Cynosure 2.0 will be a consistent growth engine for the future. Given these moving pieces, in my remarks today I'll try to put our divisional revenue result in the context of how we see the company from a strategic perspective. If we go back to 2014 and 2015, the dramatic turnaround that our team executed relied mainly on better domestic commercial execution. We knew we had clinically differentiated products and succeeded in driving their market shares to very high levels in the United States. More recently, we began layering in contributions from new products that were emerging from our revitalized R&D pipeline. And last year, our efforts to build strong international foundations began to bear fruit. Also last year, we divested our blood screening business and acquired Cynosure to shift our portfolio toward higher growth markets. As we survey the company today, we are very pleased with the positioning of our Breast Health business as well as our international growth prospects. We have successfully managed through fears of a cliff in 3D placements, and have transformed our international business from a start-up to a vibrant growth engine. Given these successes and all the good things that we see happening in Cynosure and Surgical, we are confident that these businesses are also improving in similar ways. Cynosure and Surgical are classic examples of what some of you heard me say, that sometimes the underlying capabilities of an organization are better than the numbers reflect. Said differently, it's common that, during transitions, the numbers will lag the foundational progress that's being made, and that's what we believe is happening at Cynosure and Surgical today. One reason I'm confident of this is the organizational change we made in December when we eliminated the position of Chief Operating Officer. This was a major shift in how we run the company. The executives who lead our primary businesses and regions now report directly to me, which brings me closer to our end markets and the sales teams that I value so highly. In addition, we have formed an expanded global leadership team to promote greater alignment and faster decision-making across our organization. I'm energized by this new structure because it enables me to drive an even greater urgency for organic and inorganic growth, and it's helping the entire organization return to a level of activity and speed of decision-making that characterize the early days of our turnaround. With that introduction, now let me focus on the four areas I mentioned before : Breast Health, Cynosure, Surgical and international. Breast Health, our largest business, outperformed again in the second quarter. Global Breast Health sales totaled $300.1 million, a solid increase of 4.9% compared to the prior year period. The U.S. business was essentially flat compared to the prior year period while international sales grew a robust 27.6%, marking our third consecutive quarter with growth over 20%. This performance reflects the tremendous progress we have made in building a sustainable growth engine through both organic and inorganic means, including the acquisitions of two of our European distributors. As I mentioned, we are pleased with the strategic positioning of our Breast Health business. Today, Hologic is much more than a company that sells mammography capital. Instead, we have built a diversified, increasingly global Breast Health business around the core of our Genius 3D mammography systems. And increasingly, growth is coming from new products, software and service even as capital placements in the mature U.S. market level out. In fact, domestic 3D gantries represented only about one-fourth of total Breast Health sales this quarter. We continue to feel great about ongoing market share strength in mammography, fueled in part by new products. For example, we are seeing good adoption of our new 3D Performance mammography system, which enables us to convert lower volume customers cost effectively. And late in the second quarter, we received full FDA approvals for our new 3Dimensions platform, the world's most technologically advanced 3D mammography system. Of note, the new and improved hardware and software of 3Dimensions, which enable higher resolution images and increase patient comfort, are backwards compatible with most of the Genius systems we have sold over the last several years. So, we can further smooth the boom and bust cycles of the past by driving upgrades to the several thousand Hologic 3D systems in the field, while continuing to replace thousands of remaining 2D gantries with new Genius systems. We are also pleased with the progress we've made with our interventional breast business. As we have introduced new products that enable us to participate more broadly in the clinical continuum of care and as our sales force has sold our portfolio more effectively, interventional has emerged as an additional growth platform for the company. In the second quarter, sales of interventional breast products increased 10.3%, based in part on solid U.S. uptake of our new Brevera breast biopsy system, which improves biopsy workflow and the patient experience. In addition, sales of our new Affirm prone biopsy system continue to grow. Now, let's turn to Cynosure, our Medical Aesthetics business. Cynosure sales were $85.5 million in the second quarter, an increase of 11.5% compared to pro forma results in the prior year period, when Cynosure was an independent company for most of the quarter. On a sequential basis, Cynosure sales declined versus our first quarter results, reflecting the seasonality that we discussed in our last call. As I mentioned upfront, we are very disappointed in the write-down related to our acquisition of Cynosure. While we remain optimistic about the market and our growth prospects, it is clear now one year after closing the transaction that we will not achieve the revenue goals contemplated in our deal model. As many of you know, we had an unusual amount of churn in the U.S. sales force, both pre and post close, which was highly disruptive to the business and clearly set us back. As we sit here today, roughly two-thirds of the domestic sales force is new in the last year, with many having been hired just in the last 60 to 90 days, as we needed to get managers in place before adding new reps. In many respects, delivering the results we have over the last two quarters, with only a partial sales organization, actually gives us more confidence that as the team comes up to speed we will see much brighter days ahead. I spent time with this team a couple of weeks ago, and the spirit, commitment and talent have me excited about where we're headed despite where we've been. Nonetheless, to acknowledge our much lower starting point, we are resetting revenue expectations for Cynosure today. We believe this will give us a more realistic set of targets against which we can hopefully outperform and, at the same time, reduce the outsized focus on a single franchise that represented only 11% of sales in the second quarter. We firmly believe Cynosure is on the right track, just like we knew that Kevin Thornal would get international on the right track when we sent him to Europe in early 2016. We know we have to prove it. But Kevin and his new management team are settling in at Cynosure, and their confidence is building. Let me discuss a few of the positive developments that underpin our confidence. First, we have significantly increased the size and, more importantly, the quality of our domestic sales force compared to a few quarters ago. Our new leaders are now acting as talent magnets for positions at all levels, and attracting top talent from leading companies. And while most of our new reps will need six to nine months to get fully up to speed, they are already winning business, which is an encouraging sign. For example, a new sales leader played a central role as we won a significant new SculpSure contract with LightRx. LightRx is one of the nation's largest medical aesthetics providers, and conducted an extensive analysis of competing non-invasive fat products before choosing to expand its use of SculpSure. While revenue will play out over time, the agreement represents an important confidence booster for potential SculpSure customers and even our own reps. Momentum is also building for SculpSure in other areas. Patient ratings on RealSelf, which is an influential website for the aesthetics industry, have increased dramatically and are now on par with our primary competitor. Patient interest and referrals have increased significantly based on our DTC efforts, and customers are noticing. The final reason we are encouraged about Cynosure's prospect is the strong launch of TempSure Envi, our new radiofrequency platform that minimizes facial fine lines and wrinkles, tightens skin through soft tissue coagulation, and improves the appearance of cellulite. TempSure got off to a good start even with a sales force that was operating at far less than full strength in the quarter. As our sales force matures, we believe that TempSure will be an important growth driver, especially if we roll out new applications in women's health and general surgery. We also expect TempSure will become a great example of how to win the right way in Medical Aesthetics. We will do this by creating long-term value for our customers and by leveraging our scale, stability and strength to gain sustainable competitive advantage in a fragmented industry. Now let's shift over to Surgical which posted sales of $99.4 million in the second quarter, a decline of 3.2%. MyoSure had a good quarter, posting growth of 12.3% and surpassing quarterly NovaSure sales for the first time. But NovaSure sales declined by 16.3%. As we said in our last call, we expected Surgical to be down in the second quarter. But recent ordering patterns continue to support improving trends in the back half of the year as new leadership makes a difference, comps get easier, and our revamped sales and marketing efforts take hold. MyoSure and NovaSure remain the leading brands in their categories by far, and our commercial efforts are designed to emphasize their many advantages. We believe that educating customers about the many advantages of NovaSure has helped market share trends stabilize. For example, you might have seen recently a new peer reviewed publication that highlighted better outcomes for NovaSure patients than with a new competing procedure. In addition, a recent survey of more than 700 OB-GYNs showed that 57% of physicians who try that new product had discontinued their use of it and returned to another ablation device. Of these, 87% of doctors return to NovaSure, the clear market leader. As we discussed last quarter, we are also taking steps to boost growth in what has been a declining endometrial ablation category. For example, we are partnering with actor and director, Aisha Tyler on a direct-to-patient campaign called We Hate Heavy Periods, to help overcome the stigma associated with discussing menstrual health. We are working to ensure that the one in five women who experienced abnormal uterine bleeding know that reliable, minimally invasive treatments are available, and that they don't have to suffer in silence. Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me touch briefly on another nice success story, the growth of our international businesses. Even excluding Medical Aesthetics and blood screening, OUS sales increased a robust 15.1% this quarter, our fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. And if you include contributions from Cynosure which we have now integrated into Hologic's regional management structure, OUS revenue cracked $200 million for the first time in the second quarter. To put this in perspective, international is now larger than our domestic breast imaging, molecular diagnostics and cytology franchises. So we've made really nice progress compared to what was basically a start up just a few years ago. And importantly, our performance in the second quarter was driven by broad based strength across divisions and countries, which gives us confidence that international growth is sustainable over the long term. So to wrap up, our financial results were solid in the second quarter. Revenue exceeded our guidance and EPS was in line with expectations. We are pleased with the second quarter performance of our largest division Breast Health, as well as the progress we are making internationally. And while we are disappointed with the reset on Cynosure, many signs emerged that show we're on the right track there and in Surgical as well. Now I will hand the call over to Bob. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Today in my remarks I'm going to highlight some of our other divisional sales drivers, walk through our second quarter income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, and then I'll finish with our updated financial guidance for 2018. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percent changes will be on a year-over-year basis in constant currency. Steve already highlighted our Breast Health, Surgical and Cynosure businesses, so I'll start my discussion with Diagnostics. Global Diagnostics sales of $279.7 million decreased 7.6% in constant currency. Removing the impact of our divested blood screening business, diagnostics sales grew 1.8% against the toughest comp of the year for the core business. As we alluded to on our last call, we believe U.S. diagnostics result in January and February were affected by severe weather and a terrible flu season that reduced well-woman visits. As evidence of this, our Diagnostic sales per day declined in January and February compared to prior year periods, but rebounded nicely in March. Diagnostics growth was once again led by molecular diagnostics, where global sales of $150.7 million increased 4.4%. In the United States, where we enjoy very high market shares in our key assay categories, molecular sales grew 2.5%. International molecular diagnostics grew a healthy 15% based on strength across our Aptima women's health test as well as in products. Moving on to cytology and perinatal. Global revenues of $117.7 million declined 1.4%. We are the undisputed market leader in cytology with our ThinPrep liquid Pap test and are proud of the role that more than 650 million pap tests since introduction have played in dramatically reducing deaths from cervical cancer. Our product advantages and customer relationships have enabled us to gain significant market share over the last several years. But as a reminder, it's harder to drive incremental gains from these high levels and we continue to face headwinds from longer cervical cancer screening intervals in the United States. Rounding out Diagnostics, blood screening revenues were $11.3 million in the quarter, higher than expected as we continue to fulfill our obligations to Grifols following the divestiture of the business. To wrap up the revenue discussion, Skeletal Health, a division that doesn't get much attention due to its small size, posted revenues of $24.6 million, an increase of almost 10% in constant currency. Growth was evenly distributed between DEXA products and services where interest is increasing and body composition testing for human performance and our new fluoroscopy system. Now moving down the P&L. Gross margins of 62.7% declined 120 basis points compared to the prior year. This was due primarily to geographic mix, as our international sales carry a lower gross margin percentage than sales in the U.S. Gross margin was also negatively affected by the sales mix specifically they divestiture of the blood screening business and sales of lower margin Cynosure products. Total operating expenses of $266.9 million increased 19.7% in the second quarter, mainly due to the inclusion of the Cynosure costs. If you were to back out Cynosure operating expenses, our base business declined in a low-single digit rate reflecting the very deliberate efforts to control costs and drive operating leverage. Our operating margin of 28.9% declined 380 basis points due to product and geographic mix, as well as the divestiture of our blood screening business and the addition of Cynosure. And finally, net margins of 18.7% decreased 120 basis points as the negative mix factors I discussed previously were partially offset by improvements in our non-GAAP effective tax rate mainly as a result of U.S. tax reform. All of this led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.53, an increase of 6% compared to the prior year. As a reminder, the prior year period still included the month of regular revenue and profit from blood screening prior to the divestiture. Now before we move on to guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other key financial metrics. During the second quarter, we took advantage of volatility in our share price to opportunistically repurchase our common stock. Specifically, we bought back 2.8 million shares for a total of $106.5 million. This left just under $200 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. In addition, while this activity technically fell outside of our second quarter I'm pleased to announce that as of last week, we are officially free and clear of our convertible debt. Retiring this highly dilutive debt provides us with a much stronger balance sheet and reduces variability in our diluted share count. At the end of the second quarter, our leverage ratio net debt over EBITDA stood at 2.7 times, a comfortable level for us. And finally, adjusted EBITDA of $248.2 million in the second quarter declined 3% compared to the prior year as improvements in our base business were offset by the divestiture of blood screening. Now I'd like to shift gears and discuss our non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and the third quarter. In conjunction with our re-evaluation of the Cynosure business, we are resetting expectations for near-term revenue in Medical Aesthetics, and this is the primary factor driving a reduction in our 2018 revenue guidance. As Steve discussed, we remain confident that Cynosure is on the right track, and we see several tangible signs that the business is improving. However, it's clear now that this improvement is taking longer than expected so we wanted to establish a more realistic set of baseline assumptions for Cynosure that we can hopefully beat rather than chasing a number and fueling controversy in the stock every quarter. More specifically, although we expect to see sequential improvement in Cynosure revenue in the third quarter, we don't believe the business will return to year-over-year growth until the fourth quarter of this year. As a result, we expect Cynosure's full year revenues in our fiscal 2018 to be down materially versus the $390 million the company posted on a pro forma basis in the prior four fiscal quarters from October of 2016 to September of 2017. If we look at the rest of Hologic, our revenue forecasts haven't changed much in aggregate since our last guidance. As a result, we now expect full year revenue to range from $3.18 billion to $3.21 billion with reported growth rates between 4.0% and 4.9%. Based on recent exchange rates, this translates to constant currency growth of 2.7% to 3.7%, and organic growth in the low-single digit range. As a reminder, we are defining organic revenue to exclude blood screening for the full year and Medical Aesthetics for the first two quarters of fiscal 2018. And as we discussed last quarter, organic revenue growth also adjusts for fewer selling days in 2018 and non-recurring royalty revenue in our Diagnostics business. Despite the change in our revenue guidance, we feel confident in our ability to control expenses, as well as the multiple ways we can drive leverage within the P&L. As a result, we remain committed to our previously communicated earnings per share guidance range of $2.22 to $2.27, which represents reported growth of between 9.4% and 11.8%. In addition, we expect that cash flows will remain strong. We continue to forecast the free cash flows this year in the mid-$600 million range, excluding the non-recurring tax recapture payments associated with retiring our convertible notes. This updated full year guidance is based on diluted shares outstanding of roughly 280 million for the full year, and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. Now, let's turn to guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect revenue of between $795 million and $810 million, which reflects a decline of 2.8% to a decline of 1% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, our guidance reflects revenue ranging from a decline of 1.4% to growth of 0.5%. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.55 to $0.57 in the quarter, which implies growth rates of between 10% and 14%. As you update your estimates, we would again encourage you to model around the middle of our guidance ranges as we have incorporated both upsides and downsides into our forecast. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to conclude by saying that we posted solid results in our fiscal second quarter led by our Breast Health business and our International franchises. These businesses are well-positioned to drive future growth given the strategies we have in place, and we enjoy durable leadership positions in many other product categories as well. The tremendous progress we have made across multiple fronts since 2014 has enabled us to retire all the convertible debt we inherited, completing a major financial initiative and resulting in a much stronger balance sheet. We remain confident that Cynosure is headed in the right direction, but are deeply disappointed in the write-down this quarter as well as the reduction in our full year revenue guidance. The revenue growth rates implied in the back half of the year are clearly not what we aspire to, although it's worth emphasizing that we are maintaining our guidance for EPS growth this year and remain a strong generator of cash as well. With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one, plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question today from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. We appreciate all the helpful details on Cynosure. But of course, like others, I want to dig in a bit deeper. Last quarter, it sounded like you felt like you were making pretty solid progress with the sales force and that you were seemingly on track. We definitely got that sense as well at our conference when we had the fireside chat with you intra-quarter. So, could you provide a bit more detail on what changed for Cynosure, certainly, over the past quarter and, to some extent, over the last few months? And related to that, is the guidance reduction entirely due to Cynosure sales force changes or is there something broader here? For instance, are there some market dynamics in play that maybe you didn't appreciate fully even a few weeks ago? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, Doug. It is not market dynamics. It is very much \u2013 we feel like we're making good progress with the sales team. But at the end of the day, we were expecting a huge ramp in the second half of the year. And I think as we budgeted and everything else and really went back and looked through our mid-year forecast, I think it's unrealistic in terms of what we were expecting for the second half of the year. But feeling \u2013 there is no difference in how we feel from the time we were at your conference to now, other than the ramp going forward. But I think at the end of the day, we delivered in the quarter, frankly, within the range about what I thought we would. But I think the ramp that we had implied in the second half of the year was just way, way beyond what we're going to get to. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. I guess that's kind of the crux of the question, right? I mean, not to be difficult here, but I'm sure you appreciate that, that one thing that you're talking about as being the one thing that changed is kind of the most important thing that's changed. So, what did you see happen in the quarter that you didn't appreciate even a few weeks ago? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Nothing happened in the quarter that we didn't appreciate a few weeks ago, other than really thinking more about the true trajectory going forth. We just delivered $91 million, frankly, in the first fiscal quarter, call it, $85 million and change this quarter, which is frankly very consistent with the seasonal declines you see. Feel good about where we're going. But again, our original guidance for the year implied a much, much stronger ramp, especially in that second half of the year. But I think the team is settling in very, very well. I was just with the sales force a few weeks ago. I think the true churn that occurred in the sales force was just far bigger than we ever imagined, but do feel very good about the leadership and the people we have in place now. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, Doug, I think, in addition to that, as the teams were settling in, I think we've learned a lot more around the ramp. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: And so, we were expecting a much more significant ramp. And as the teams have come in, in this last quarter, I think we've got a better understanding and a better handle on that. And hopefully, we've put ourselves in a situation where we can get into a situation where we can beat and raise, and are looking at this as a conservative number as opposed to chasing the number. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah, Doug, just to add one more point. This was only Kevin Thornal's second quarter of actually running the business. And I know it seems like forever, trust me he's a very large shareholder in this company and myself. And where we are, it seems like forever in terms of what we're doing in terms of the turnaround here. But at the end of the day, even as Kevin has gotten in and gotten a lot deeper into the business, much better handle on where that trajectory is going. Operator : Next we'll hear from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. So in Diagnostics, how much do you think the Easter flu weather impacted the quarter? And can you talk about the competitive environment with some of the new products whether you think those are starting to resonate? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Jack, hey. This is Bob. I'll answer the first part of your question in terms of the impact. Quite honestly, it's really hard to know. But what we can say is based on some data that we have that well-woman visits in January and February declined at high-single digit rates in the U.S. versus year ago. So we do think it had a decent impact on our business and we saw in March where it actually rebounded and improved a bit. And on the new products, I think we're getting some nice progress on those in the uptake. And so far they're still small relative to the overall size of our STI platform, but we're seeing nice feedback certainly from Fusion as well as some of the new products, the Virals and some of the other new products that we have globally. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: We've always said that those are \u2013 yeah, I'm sorry. We've always said those are primarily going to be a growth driver in 2019. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then a two parter on Breast Health. International, great results. Maybe just talk about what the drivers were there. And then in the U.S., recent MQSA data month-to-month, but just talk about some of the recent placement trends? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. International, I think, we are thrilled with the progress we're making. And I'd also remind everybody since we have Kevin Thornal running our Cynosure business, he's the one we sent in Europe a couple of years ago and it was a train wreck. And he totally put all the foundational elements into place that are paying off today for international business. Country by country, we are winning more tenders. Our dealers are more engaged. We also did pick up our dealer in Germany as well as Spain and are winning more accounts since those are now owned by us than they used to win \u2013 winning more tenders than what they did when they were standalone dealers. So, just feeling great about the foundational progress that has been built over there. Regarding the MQSA data, I'd remind everybody, there's always little variations. And particularly there was a change in methodology that occurred in April where the FDA is now basically having the ACR, certify the machines. We think that may have resulted in more volatility than usual on the most recent number. Having said that, we feel great about what we are doing in the Breast Health business. And I'm so proud of our team. The market shares we continue to garner, particularly in the United States on 3D, is well beyond, I think, what anybody, ourselves included, could've imagined a couple of years ago in a very competitive market. What our teams are doing there, and not only driving additional gantries and winning so many competitive customers over to us, but then building out that product line. Our interventional business being built out, the service business, the software, and if you see, again, that whole cliff that everybody was so concerned about a couple of years ago under Pete Valenti and our team in the U.S., they have really, really started to change that curve and feel very good about both what they've done and where we're headed. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, if I had to maybe draw an analogy, it's been an interesting season so far. One of \u2013 your peer company from your former life, they took their numbers and the stock actually went-up because the feeling was it was clear when you went for it. And I think what some of the hoarders are questioning is especially looking at quarter stock is in the aftermarket, has the guidance been reset? Like, what's the comfort level that this has been now reset and we won't have any more disappointments going forward? Stephen MacMillan : Sure, Vijay. It's a great question. Glad you asked it. We feel very good. We don't like the reset. And candidly, we have a lot of debate of do we go as low as we do? We wanted it to be a clearing event. We wanted to get the numbers down as painful as it is. We know there's been a huge overhang and there's been such an obsession with Cynosure. And I would tell you, as I sit here today I have two very mixed feelings. One is I am disappointed because we never like to do this to have to write down and take guidance down. On the other hand I much more confident in our outlook of where we're going. And I fundamentally believe business by business, we have every business getting stronger and going on the right track. So it's \u2013 and I know that's a weird juxtaposition of emotions. But as I sit here \u2013 I know having been with the Cynosure sales team, that market is still a great market. We are increasingly getting the team together. And I don't think people fully understood even though we've talked about it, the gaping holes we had in that sales team. So now as I'm starting to see people getting the wins together. really feeling very good. And my \u2013 frankly, I think our hope was this would be the clearing event to try to get the obsession around Cynosure monthly number, quarterly numbers behind us to where we're not going to be missing and we're going to get into a good place going forward. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : No, understood. And maybe, Bob, one on the guidance. The EPS, I'm kind of having a hard time getting to the range. Is there something below the line maybe on the tax rate for the year which went down, which maybe perhaps \u2013 and explain such as given the guidance cut on the top line and what we saw from a margin front in the Q? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: No. The tax rate is pretty consistent across the quarters. What we have said is, we were taking some investment \u2013 the opportunity to make some investment as a result of the tax rate reduction earlier in the year, and we're actually managing some of the rate or the take down through OpEx reductions. So we're not making \u2013 we've made some investments. We were planning to make more. We're actually probably scaling some of that back to ensure that we've got the strong foundation, because we didn't deliver all of the EPS earnings potential as a result of the tax rate reduction to the bottom line when we first gave guidance. Operator : Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs has our next question. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Isaac. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: On Cynosure \u2013 hey. Could you tell us when we might be able to expect meaningful new product launches? And the reason I asked is SculpSure got a 510(k) clearance in 2015, and 2016 was a good year for Cynosure so clearly that product cycle has an immediate and significant impact. So you said that the business might need some refreshing in the portfolio. It would be helpful to know kind of when we might expect that. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. I think TempSure just launched in this last quarter. So I think part of what gives us increasing confidence of where we're headed is the TempSure launch is off to a very nice start. And it will have additional applications that will be coming over time, so it may not have the incredible spike. SculpSure was probably an unusually large huge uptick. But I think the fundamental strength of TempSure feel really, really good about where that's going. And the initial sell-in, frankly we're very, very pleased with. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks. And just a follow-up on capital allocation. Obviously, this is one of the more significant transactions under your tenure and it's been obviously a little disappointing to start. So how has that informed your appetite for future deals? I think in prior quarters you've said that you're still interested looking at bolt-ons. But I'm wondering if maybe it makes sense to pump the brakes a little bit more until you put up a couple good quarters here or if this really sort of unaffected to your view on future M&A? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Isaac, obviously, we're incredibly disappointed. And therefore it does affect how we think about it going forward. But really, what it comes down to is we now want to be really focused as we'd like to be on true tuck-ins that supplement our existing businesses. So, that's where we're very focused, much smaller deal size than obviously Cynosure. That was an unusual opportunity. But at the end of the day, we're very focused now really by division. That added a new division to us. Now, all of our focus is within the existing divisions. And the other piece I would say is, I'm much more closely driving the inorganic, the business development propositions by having the division presidents reporting directly to me, and feel very good that we're both making go and no-go decisions faster in the process. And I do think \u2013 I hope to see some small little things that will be coming forth over the course of the year, but clearly on a very different scale. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Bill. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Bill. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: So, I guess I think I know the answer to this first question, but I'm going to throw it out there anyway, Steve. It sounds like \u2013 did I hear it correctly that you finished hiring out or building out, I should say, the sales team for Cynosure, so all those seats are filled and now it's kind of a bit of a waiting game to get them up the curve? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. It's not fully built out, but I'd say we're 90-ish percent there now. And it is. And I would say it's \u2013 while it's \u2013 I'd probably say it's less about waiting for them to get up to speed. We're training them in a different ways much more aggressively. We're seeing some of them starting to hit the ground running and getting their sales far faster than what we might have usually expected. And that's what gives us a good outlook. I think coming back really to an earlier question two of we haven't wanted to take debt by a thousand cuts. We wanted to survey the situation long enough, have Kevin in this role. He's been reporting directly to me now for the last four months. I think we have a very good handle on where the business is going, what's going on, and figured, okay, let's just take it down and then we build from here. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Understood. And then just, I guess, kind of thinking a little longer term, Steve, about the business with new products like TempSure as well as the ongoing competitive dynamic. Once we kind of get through the period of getting these guys up and running, trained, productive, how should we be thinking about the longer term kind of pace of the segment? Should we be thinking about this as double-digit type of revenue growth once we get beyond this interim period here? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Absolutely. That's how we're thinking about it, Bill. This is still the fastest-growing market of any market we compete in. And as you know, with us, every market we compete in, we play to do very well and grow faster than the markets. And I fully believe we will be there in the exact same place over time. This is a product-driven, relationship-driven, sales force-driven business, just as our other businesses. We've had a little bit of an extra learning curve in this particular one. But there is nothing in it that says we can't compete and do exceptionally well. We also see it still \u2013 despite obviously a major competitor in Allergan, the rest of the business is still very \u2013 the rest of the industry is still very fragmented. And we see big opportunity still over time that will also be an area for tuck-ins and things like that once we have the sales force well established. And that's exactly where we're going to be focused. Operator : Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, Steve. Can you talk more about the strategy to get GYN Surg growing again, other than easy comps and new leadership? And on the competitive front, you did \u2013 publication has been asked if you retracted, so I'm just wondering whether you're willing to comment on that at all as well. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. I'm very, very happy that you asked that question. It will not be retracted. We feel very good about the underlying way that that study was done. So, feel really, really good about that. And you said other than easy comps and leadership, I'll go with the second one. Other than leadership, well, leadership is what it's about. And this is another one that we replaced the President, the VP of Sales, three of the four regional leaders and more than half of the managers, all in the last nine months, and feel really, really good about where that business and those leaders are going from a competitive standpoint. You see, MyoSure started to pick back up this quarter. We're watching the underlying trends and feeling good that that business has come down. We said back in January at your conference, I said, hey, we're going to be in for a few rougher quarters. If you look, our first quarter was down, call it, 8%; this quarter, down 5-ish. I think we may still not \u2013 we'll likely still be down a touch maybe this quarter. And I think by the time we exit the year, exactly as we said at your conference in January, I think we'll be back to growth and moving in that right trajectory. But as I acknowledge, I think we fell asleep at the switch a little bit too long. We were slow making leadership changes in that division, and our teams are fighting back now. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, a follow-up on Cyno, for Bob maybe. Was the entire guidance cut from Cyno? You said it was primarily Cyno, so I just want to make sure there's not something else that's changing in the assumptions. And then, does the write-down have implications on the level of reinvestment you're willing to make on that business around DTC and other areas? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. I'll take the second question first. The answer on that is no, it doesn't affect the level of investment. The write-off is really a reflection of, hey, we've got a much lower base than it was originally contemplated in our model and it's going to take us longer, but we're still expecting growth in that business and we'll invest behind that. In regards to the takedown, the majority of it \u2013 vast majority of it was Cynosure. We took that down multiple tens of millions of dollars, as you can expect or as you can imagine, relative to the forecast that we had built in. There are some small changes relative to probably Diagnostics with the not getting back, the January and February, but those are small. I would add one other thing on the piece with NovaSure. I think not only the clinical results that have come out and were published, but also some of the survey, I think we've given our sales organization more tools to be able to be much more competitive in the marketplace. So, it's not only new leadership, it's also new tools to actually get out there and provide. And then with NovaSure ADVANCED that's been out, really driving that as well. Operator : Jon Block with Stifel has our next question. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Jon. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, Steve. I'll ask two quick ones. First, just on the gross margins. The gross margins were a bit below what we were looking for specific to fiscal 2Q. And so, Bob, maybe if you can talk about, was that specific to one division versus another? And then, how should we think about gross margins going forward? And then, I just got a quick follow-up. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. So, there wasn't any one-time discrete event in there. It was really a result of probably two things, geographic mix with our international business really driving that and then product mix within the divisions. I would expect that to be flat to slightly improving over the rest of the year. As Surgical comes back to growth, that's a very highly \u2013 a very accretive gross margin business. And then, actually as the U.S. business and Cynosure, that also has a much better gross margin than overall Cynosure as a whole. So, we do think that that will help \u2013 kind of help with gross margin going forward, and we've obviously got our continued productivity model programs as well. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, I think I've got this number right, but the 15.1% international growth, call it, ex Cyno and blood, can you approximate what the organic growth was, sort of if you exclude some of the recent distributor tuck-ins, if you can quantify that? Thanks, guys. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. This is Bob. That was still roughly double-digit total. Operator : Thank you. Next, we hear from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. So, a question or two. So, I appreciate the fact that when you revamped the European sales force, you sent Kevin over there and you were able to turn it around. But when I look at that, it's because I think Hologic certainly has very good technology, very differentiated products and certainly there is a medical need for those products. So \u2013 and the same thing in Surgical, I can certainly understand how the sales force coming in, a new management coming in is going to do that. That isn't really the case with Cynosure. I mean, there's not a lot of medical need for it. There is \u2013 the publications around it are a little bit choppy in terms of what it is. It's like \u2013 so, my question is, it's like, where the same playbooks work given that you're trying to go into a market which is a little bit fuzzier than what you're normally going after? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Fair question, Derik. I look at it slightly different. While the medical need is traditionally defined might not be as big, there is huge demand. And the people who want these procedures and the docs providing them, there's a lot more data and the opportunity to drive data. But at the end of the day, this is about great products and great sales people. And that's really what drives this business, and building long-term customer relationships. So, that is not that different than what we can do. And we know, we just got to go prove it. We will. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I mean \u2013 and have you seen any traction at all in the OB/GYN market for MonaLisa? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes, yes. And again, we think that particularly with additional clinical data over time and our sales force, we're seeing some new customer interest in that product and do feel very good about where that will go over time, and also that that will be the leading edge frankly to help a lot of OB/GYNs get into cash pay, everything else. We always said we didn't do Cynosure for 2017 or 2018, we did it for the long haul. We know patience is thin right now on it, but we're incredibly focused and, frankly, only the coming quarters, what we say now probably isn't going to matter a lot, but I'm very confident we'll be putting those points on the board as we go forward. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Operator, I think we have time for maybe one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. And just to follow up a little bit on that last question. There's a lot of talk obviously within Cyno about what's going on in \u2013 on the body category, and you mentioned a little bit here on OB/GYN. But there's other parts here, the skin part is well. Can you just talk about where it is that you're really seeing the deficit here relative to what you originally thought? Is it all on that body side? Is it that the OB/GYN's a little bit less or is the skin not coming through kind of where you thought? And can you also address, if you wouldn't mind, what your longer term margin expectations are for the business? I understand \u2013 I recognize that you're still thinking longer \u2013 double-digit growth in the outyears, but how do you think about the profitability of this business going forward? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure Brian. The first part is the deficits that we see are less byproduct category than they were the gaping holes where we didn't have sales people on the streets. And again, we keep trying to emphasize, there were a lot of holes in the sales force, we just didn't have people showing up. And therefore every product line was that \u2013 we had areas that had virtually very few sales at all. So, it's \u2013 the gaps we're looking at are far more by territory than by product line. As we go forth and we're starting to see it, as we're putting people back in those territories, we're seeing SculpSure, we're seeing TempSure, we're seeing Icon. We're seeing all of the categories start to get the lift back up for the things. Ultimately, profitability over time, we think it's going to take some time. The gross margin will be slightly dilutive to the company here in the nearer term. Long-term, can that be at the company average? We certainly would hope so. Operating margins today are very, very small, so that will be an opportunity over time. I think that'll still take multiple years before that gets to a \u2013 an operating margin that is not dilutive to the company. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. Have a good evening.",

Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to the Hologic Inc. Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jessica and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Jessica. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. We're also joined by our new CFO, Karleen Oberton. Karleen was formerly our chief accounting officer, and we just announced that she's replacing Bob this week. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks, then we'll have a question and answer session. Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived for 30 days. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release, and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you Mike, and good afternoon everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We posted strong results overall, with both total revenue and earnings per share finishing above our guidance ranges. Breast Health outperformed, our core international franchises continued to grow at a robust pace, and our molecular diagnostics franchise accelerated from last quarter. In addition, both our Surgical and Medical Aesthetics divisions, which had struggled recently, showed solid sequential improvement, in line with our expectations. And just today, we closed a tuck-in acquisition that will further strengthen and expand our Breast Health franchise. We'll discuss that more in a moment, but first, let me provide an overview of our top-line results. In the third quarter, revenue of $824 million grew 2.2% on a reported basis, or 1.1% in constant currency. Although we're not satisfied with this growth rate, we believe we are making encouraging progress in several areas of the company. Before we discuss that progress, let me point out that like many others, we had a tailwind from the weaker dollar compared to the prior year period. This benefit, however, was less than we forecast three months ago, since the dollar has strengthened since then. In addition, please note that we have now annualized the effects of the Cynosure acquisition and the blood screening divestiture, both of which occurred in the second quarter of last year. Now let's get into the details. Breast Health, our biggest business, led the way in the third quarter, as U.S. revenue accelerated while international sales remained strong. Diagnostics improved from a soft second quarter, with upside from the divested blood screening business. Surgical was basically flat on a global basis, and as we predicted, is showing steady improvement over the last three quarters. Cynosure also finished in line with our expectations, declining compared to a tough comp in the prior year period, but increasing sequentially. In terms of geography, our legacy international franchises again demonstrated robust growth in the third quarter. Excluding Cynosure, OUS revenue increased 14.5%. This performance was once again led by Breast Health, but our other businesses also contributed strong growth, reflecting the significant, broad-based improvements we have made in talent and capabilities in recent years. Including OUS sales of Cynosure products, which declined in the period, total international sales were $207.2 million, an increase of 5.5%. On the subject of international, and in response to recent news, let me mention that while China represents only about 3.5% of our total sales, several of our products are included on the expanded list of potential Chinese tariffs. So while we do not think these potential tariffs would have a significant impact on the company, we are keeping a close eye on the situation. In the United States, total revenue of $616.8 million was basically flat in the third quarter, down 30 basis points. Underpinning this, however, we saw positive momentum in our legacy franchises, as growth rates improved sequentially in Breast Health, Diagnostics and Surgical. Cynosure sales declined materially compared to the tough comp in the prior year period, as expected, but increased on a sequential basis, reflecting a strengthening commercial organization in the United States. Now let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results in the third quarter. As mentioned, Breast Health outperformed again in the period. Global Breast Health sales totaled $307.9 million, a robust increase of 7.4%. International continued to lead the way, with sales growth of just over 20% for the fourth consecutive quarter, despite annualizing the first of our two European distributor acquisitions. In addition, the much larger U.S. breast business strengthened in the quarter and posted growth of 4.4%, a testament to our team, the strategies they have put in place, and solid commercial execution. Within Breast Health, sales of imaging products increased 6.5% globally, our best growth rate since the second quarter of 2016. We continue to gain market share behind our clinically differentiated Genius 3D mammography systems, and have bolstered growth by revitalizing our R&D pipeline and introducing new products. These include our 3Dimensions and 3D Performance Systems, and our Affirm prone biopsy system, all of which are performing well. At the same time, sales of interventional products continued their recent hot streak, increasing 12.4% globally. With this third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, interventional is emerging as another important growth platform. New products played a role here as well, especially our revolutionary new Brevera biopsy system, which improves biopsy workflow and the patient experience. Our Breast Health business gets even stronger with the acquisition of Faxitron, which we announced today. Before I discuss the details, I'd like to take this opportunity to publicly welcome nearly 70 Faxitron employees to Hologic. This transaction broadens our product portfolio and expands the role we play in the clinical continuum of care for breast cancer patients. Faxitron's market-leading products, which span from digital specimen radiography to breast lesion localization to sentinel lymph node biopsy solutions, are sold via a strong distribution channel that focuses on breast surgeons and pathologists. So Faxitron will complement our strengths in the mammography suite and enable us to play a larger role in breast conserving surgery, an adjacent growth market. From a financial perspective, acquiring Faxitron is consistent with our capital deployment goals. It's a great tuck-in acquisition that leverages our expertise in the breast health channel, while providing attractive growth and return on invested capital. We are seeing increased business development activity across our divisions, and hope that acquisitions like Faxitron will become a more regular part of our story in coming quarters. Faxitron also reinforces a theme that we discussed in our last call, that our Breast Health division is much more than mammography machines today. We have built a diversified, increasingly global business around the core of our Genius 3D platform. And increasingly, growth is coming from new products, software, and service, even as capital placements in the mature U.S. market level out. In fact, domestic 3D gantries represented only about 20% of global Breast Health sales this quarter, as our sales force gets better and better at understanding customers' needs and selling our full portfolio. The energy and excitement in our Breast Health division has never been stronger than it is today, based on a clinically differentiated core of mammography systems, multiple new products built around this core, and now a complementary tuck-in acquisition. Before we move on, let me mention that we are also pleased with the favorable initial ruling issued by the International Trade Commission in our patent infringement complaint against Fuji. The judge recommended an exclusion order that prevents the importation of infringing Fuji products into the United States, and a cease and desist order that prevents the further sale of those products here. We look forward to a final ruling by the ITC in November. Moving on to Diagnostics, revenue of $294.3 million grew 2.3%. The growth driver here continues to be molecular, where global sales of $154.5 million grew 6.3% and also accelerated sequentially. Internationally, molecular grew in the mid-teens, marking the eighth time in the last nine quarters we have achieved double-digit growth, and reflecting a steady cadence of new product introductions into global markets. In the U.S., where we already enjoy high market shares in our key assay categories, molecular still grew at a healthy mid-single-digit rate, improving from a tough second quarter that we believe was negatively affected by a bad flu season. Our Aptima women's health assays on the Panther system remain the primary growth drivers in dollar terms, but we're also seeing nice adoption of our virology menu at a variety of labs. Although the base remains small, sales of our quantitative HIV, HCV and HPV tests more than doubled again versus the prior year period. And we are optimistic that the Global Access Initiative we announced last week will lead to further growth of viral testing in resource-limited countries. Elsewhere in Diagnostics, cytology and perinatal sales of $121.1 million declined 1.8%. Cytology growth remains challenged in the United States due to our high market shares and longer cervical cancer testing intervals, but a solid quarter internationally enabled global cytology sales to finish roughly flat. On the other hand, sales of our fetal fibronectin test declined, dragging down this sub-segment. Finally on Diagnostics, revenue related to our divested blood screening business totaled $18.6 million. Although this represented a decline of 2.1%, it was roughly double what we forecast. Nonetheless, we have now annualized the financial impact of the blood screening divestiture, and expect a significant reduction in quarterly blood screening revenue going forward. Now let's cover our GYN Surgical division. Consistent with our expectations, global revenues of $107.7 million increased fractionally after posting two disappointing quarters of declines. Underpinning this, we are encouraged to see signs of stabilization in NovaSure. As we discussed in our last call, our new leadership team is changing the culture of the Surgical sales force, investing more in the endometrial ablation category, and emphasizing the benefits of our product relative to competitors. As a result, while NovaSure sales declined 7.6% on a global basis, this rate of decline was much less than in recent quarters. At the same time, MyoSure continues to perform well, with growth of 9.6% in the quarter. As our Surgical team continues to execute better, we do expect the total business to return to better growth in the fourth quarter. Before we leave Surgical, let me mention that we're very gratified by our victory in the patent infringement lawsuit we initiated against Minerva. As you probably know, last week a jury awarded us $4.8 million in damages for Minerva's infringement of two of our NovaSure patents. As the legal process continues to play out, we intend to seek a permanent injunction prohibiting Minerva from selling the infringing device in the United States. Now let's discuss Medical Aesthetics, which posted sales of $91.7 million, down 18% versus a large comp in the prior year period. Coming off a disappointing reset last quarter, we believe these results represent a step in the right direction. While we still have a lot of work to do at Cynosure, we are encouraged that revenue finished in line with expectations in the third quarter, and increased sequentially. Aesthetics markets remain healthy, and our revamped domestic sales force is settling in and gaining confidence. This helps us strengthen relationships with customers, and also gives us strategic flexibility. For example, we recently signed an agreement with Porter Instrument, a business unit of Parker Hannifin Corporation, to distribute their Nitronox nitrous oxide system, which physicians are increasingly using to reduce pain and anxiety during aesthetic procedures. In addition, we have agreed to distribute another El.En laser in the United States, this one for hair removal. These deals show how we can supplement organic innovation with small transactions that capitalize on our commercial strength, scale and stability, with the ultimate goal of building sustainable competitive advantage in a fragmented industry. We are beginning to see other signs of progress from the changes our new leadership team is implementing at Cynosure. For example, our new TempSure radiofrequency platform is off to a good start. Encouragingly, most TempSure systems are being purchased by customers who are new to Cynosure, broadening our customer base and opening up long-term opportunities for additional placements and upgrades. SculpSure also posted solid growth sequentially, above what we would have anticipated from normal seasonality, as our efforts to strengthen this brand in the underpenetrated noninvasive fat reduction market are beginning to pay off. For example, SculpSure ratings on RealSelf, an influential website for the aesthetics industry, have increased dramatically, and are now better than our primary competitors. Patient interest and referrals have increased significantly based on our DTC efforts and better post-sale support, and customers are noticing. And finally, in another sign that the health of the business is improving, recurring revenue from customer service and disposables increased almost 10% in the quarter, and represented more than a quarter of total sales. This despite the decline in overall Cynosure sales. So while we are still very much in prove it mode with Cynosure, we are learning how to win the right way in aesthetics, and forecast that Cynosure will become a consistent growth engine starting next quarter, as the prior-year comps normalize. Before we leave Cynosure, let me say that just yesterday we received the FDA letter regarding MonaLisa Touch, which represents less than 10% of Cynosure's sales. We are still analyzing the FDA's specific concerns, but acknowledge that this may create some market uncertainty around MLT in the short term. Having said that, we obviously agree that these products need to be marketed appropriately. Given our strength in Women's Health, the studies we have already done for MLT, and our efforts to demonstrate the clinical value of all our products, we believe we can be a leader here over the long-term, especially relative to competitors that may not have our compliance and regulatory capabilities. I want to be very clear here, we believe a higher level of scrutiny from regulatory authorities will benefit us over time, since we share the same goals as FDA \u2013 clinically strong products that improve lives and are marketed responsibly. We are all about supporting technology with science and clinical evidence, so we welcome the more level playing field that this action signals. To wrap up the revenue discussion briefly, Skeletal Health revenues of $22.5 million grew 2.1% due to strong international sales and continued solid adoption of our bone density systems, which are used both for osteoporosis screening and human performance management. So to wrap up, our financial results were strong in the third quarter, with both revenue and EPS exceeding our guidance. While Breast Health and international led the way from a growth perspective, we are also pleased with the progress we are making in Surgical and at Cynosure. And we are excited about today's acquisition of Faxitron to boost our breast business. Before I hand the call over to Bob, let me take this opportunity to thank him for four outstanding years as our CFO. As we announced separately today, Bob will be leaving the company to join Agilent. Since coming to Hologic in 2014, Bob has played a key role in our success. He has been a terrific leader in the organization, and a great partner to me. He helped our businesses return to growth, which in turn, enabled us to improve our cash flows and strengthen our balance sheet by paying off debt. And he built strong relationships with many of you on this call. While we are sorry to see Bob leave, we are also excited to promote Karleen Oberton, our Chief Accounting Officer, to replace him. A 12-year Hologic veteran, Karleen has a deep knowledge of our businesses, our markets, and our people. She was already a member of our Global Leadership Team, and has long been a valued partner for our divisions, as well as an expert on financial planning and accounting matters. She is ideally qualified to both continue and expand the financial progress we have made, and Mike and I look forward to introducing her to many of you soon. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Thanks Steve, and good afternoon everyone. Before I begin, let me just say thank you, Steve, our Board of Directors, and the entire Hologic team, for the honor and privilege of working with you over the last four years. I am immensely proud of what we've achieved, not just from a financial perspective, but also in terms of building a sustainable growth business and making a huge difference for Women's Health. I will miss many things about Hologic, but I leave optimistic about the company's future, and confident that Karleen will take the finance team and the organization to even greater heights. I also look forward to staying in touch with many of the investors and analysts on this call in my new role. Now let's get to our third-quarter results. In my remarks today, I'm going to walk through our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, then finish with our updated financial guidance for 2018. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Steve mentioned, we posted strong results in the third quarter that exceeded both our revenue and EPS guidance. Breast Health and international drove our growth, while Cynosure and Surgical improved sequentially as well. This top-line performance, combined with solid expense control, a lower effective tax rate, and our share repurchase program, enabled us to post non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58, 16% higher than a year ago. Moving down the P&L, gross margin of 62.6% decreased 50 basis points compared to the prior year. This was primarily due to product and geographic mix, as our international sales carry a lower gross margin percentage than sales in the United States. Total operating expenses of $279 million were up 1.5%, as we balanced our efforts to drive leverage within the operating expense line with our desire to increase funding for key growth initiatives, as well as to protect our intellectual property through legal activities. Operating margin of 28.8% was down 20 basis points compared to a year ago, primarily due to the effect of geographic mix on gross margins. Now to round out the discussion of the income statement. Net margins of 19.3% increased 130 basis points compared to a year ago, due mainly to a lower effective tax rate. We also took advantage of volatility in our share price to opportunistically repurchase our common stock in the third quarter. Specifically, we bought back 2.2 million shares for a total of $80.8 million. In addition, we're pleased to announce that the board has approved a new, $500 million share repurchase authorization to replace our old plan. So as I mentioned previously, all these activities led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 in the third quarter, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year. So even as the international grows more rapidly than our U.S. business, we continue to increase EPS at a rate well above sales. Before we talk about our updated guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other key financial metrics. Our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, currently stands at 2.6 times, and we remain comfortable around this level, recognizing that it could fluctuate a little based on the timing of transactions like Faxitron. One reason we are comfortable with our debt level is we continue to generate strong cash flow. This quarter, free cash flow was $209 million, and we have generated $472 million of free cash year-to-date, when you exclude the non-recurring tax recapture payments associated with retiring our convertible notes. Our strong cash flow and the revamping of our debt structure provide us with plenty of capacity to continue to pursue small tuck-in acquisitions like Faxitron, while also acting opportunistically on our $500 million share repurchase authorization. Finally, adjusted EBITDA of $261.7 million increased slightly compared to the prior year. Now let's turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and fourth quarter, beginning with our full-year revenue guidance. We are increasing our full-year guidance due to our strong performance in the third quarter. We now expect reported revenue of $3.205 billion to $3.22 billion in fiscal 2018, representing reported growth of 4.8% to 5.3%. Based on recent exchange rates, this equates to constant currency growth of between 3.9% and 4.4%, higher than our guidance from last quarter. With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance implies revenues of $800 million to $815 million in the fourth quarter. Compared to the prior year period, this reflects revenue ranging from a decline of 0.4% to growth of 1.5% on a reported basis, or growth of 0.1% to 1.9% in constant currency terms. Underlying this forecast, we are incorporating recent FX rates, as the dollar has strengthened since we last guided. We now expect currency to be a headwind in the fourth quarter and into 2019 as well. Also from a divisional perspective, let me remind you that in last year's fourth quarter, Diagnostics benefited from roughly $9.5 million in royalty payments that will not recur this year. Also in Diagnostics, as Steve mentioned, we expect blood screening to decline to a little more than half of the third quarter level. We forecast that Surgical growth will improve in the fourth quarter, while Cynosure will grow year-over-year, but decline on a sequential basis due to normal seasonality and the potential near-term impact of the FDA letter on MonaLisa Touch. Now let's move on to our revised EPS forecast. We are tightening our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year to a range of $2.24 to $2.26, or roughly $2.25, which implies reported growth of about 10.8% despite absorbing incremental FX headwind I discussed. So we are growing our non-GAAP earnings at a double-digit rate despite having a material EPS contribution from blood screening in the prior year. This earnings guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates, a full-year tax rate of about 23%, and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 278 million to 279 million for the full year. Our full-year EPS guidance translates to non-GAAP earnings per share range for the fourth quarter of $0.58 to $0.60, or roughly $0.59, which would represent an increase of about 18% on a reported basis. As you update your estimates, we would again encourage you to model around these midpoints, as we've incorporated both upsides and downsides into our forecast. Before opening the call for questions, let me summarize by saying we exceeded our revenue and EPS commitments in the third quarter. Our results highlight the progress we've made, and the opportunities ahead of us, for both Breast Health and international. At the same time, we're encouraged by the progress we're making in Surgical and at Cynosure, and remain bullish that these efforts will begin to pay off with better growth for these divisions starting in the fourth quarter. With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go now to Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company : Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. I'll just ask the two of them and then I'll listen to your answers, both are on Molecular Diagnostics. So first you've recently launched a number of new molecular diagnostic assays, including but not limited to virology. In your prepared remarks, you've talked about strong virology growth while acknowledging it was off of a small base. Do you expect these assays to have an impact on system placements and overall Molecular revenue growth in a more meaningful broader way in fiscal 2019? And then the second question is really on the pricing environment for U.S. molecular products. I'm wondering if pricing erosion has accelerated as your new reagent rental contracts. And related to that your contract with a large reference lab has now passed the five year mark, I'm wondering if you could provide an update on where you are on renewing that contract. So I guess that was actually three questions instead of two. Sorry about that. Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: I was going to say Doug that was very clever of the way you \u2013 two questions and it was clearly three. Let's, we will try to take them all. I think in terms of the Molecular Diagnostics piece, we are seeing continued growth in Panther placements, driven both by just our sales activities but the enhanced menu is definitely helping on that. And, so again, I think it's all incrementally strengthening that will pay off and continue. We expect continued Panther placements into 2019. We're probably seeing a little bit more of an uptick in some of our international Panther placements in the last couple of quarters, which we think also bodes well to continue that growth going forward. In terms of pricing pressures, nothing significantly different in the quarter, pretty flattish. And the final piece in terms of discussions about any particular contracts, as we said in the past, we're not going to comment on any specific customer negotiations, but we'll share more of that as we go into next year's guidance and everything else that will be factored in. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe I'll start the first one on that... Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Just when you thought Vijay that we hit you with all the news we could in the last few days. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : Yes, you did Steve. It's certainly been a lot to digest, and maybe, and maybe I'll start with the management transition here. Bob, congrats on the move. But I'm just curious because just from a Hologic perspective, a lot of us who've looked at the story for a number of years we've thought the business was on its path to being a sustainable top line grower. I'm just curious on the timing and maybe some -- if you could provide some background on the transition I think that would be helpful? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Vijay. And what I would say is in many ways I'm very sad to leave Hologic. I couldn't be more proud of what we've accomplished and of the talented team that we have here in place, and quite honestly the opportunities the business has ahead of it. My experience here was a big stepping stone in kind of my professional career that actually gave me the opportunity to have the opportunity at Agilent which is a more global company or slightly bigger. And what I would say is I leave knowing that the company is in better shape than certainly when I got here. And I leave it in very capable hands with Karleen. I know she will be a great partner to Steve and the rest of the leadership team here and will continue the great work that we've been doing. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon and thank you. Congrats to Bob. But just maybe on the Faxitron acquisition. Could you just give us a little bit of detail on the nature of the business? And in particular just curious about the impact it will have to gross margins. I took a quick look at the website and it seems like there's a combination of equipment and disposables. So just interested in sort of the profitability contribution that business will have at the gross margin level. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, hey, Isaac, it's Bob. This business generated roughly $27 million in its last fiscal year. So it's not going to have a material impact on the total company. We do believe that there's opportunities to improve gross margins over time, obviously leveraging the scale that we have. They're slightly lower than where we are today but we do see that that has an opportunity to improve. As we think about the business probably not going to have any impact in 2018 and it will be EPS neutral in 2019 but then accretive thereafter. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats to both Bob as well as Karleen. Let's see, staying at Faxitron for a second, if I may. I guess just a couple of follow-up questions off of Isaac's. So I guess tell us how quickly can you get the Breast Health team trained in on the product line? And then U.S., OUS revenue split? And then lastly looks like we probably should have about $4.5 million dialed in for the fourth quarter? Thanks. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, hey, Bill this is Bob. We're probably not going to give you the international OUS split right now. What I would say is it's \u2013 although I would say the majority of the revenue is in the U.S. as we think about it they do have a strong distribution channel already, so what we are going to be able to do is leverage that as well as then bring our what I'll call discipline to it and improve. So we bring a channel. We bring some expertise and that actually expands our offerings within the radiology and then the breast biopsy suite. So we think about it as an adjacency that they already have a strong \u2013 they have a leading position in the products that they provide. I think we'll be able to utilize our resources and expertise to actually grow that business even beyond what they were able to do. Operator : We'll go now to Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking... Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: Brian, before you jump in, operator if I could just ask. Make sure you allow a follow-up question too. That would be great. Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question. So Steve, throw one out to see how you react to it. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: (35:47). Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. So you talked about not being satisfied with 1.1% growth this quarter. I'm just curious what do you think is the satisfying level of growth for the company at this point, given the makeup of the business is? Longer term, how do you think about where you want to be there on growth? 1.1%, clearly not where you want to be. Q4, maybe more in that 4% range, but how do you think about what is satisfying here? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Clearly, given the nature of the businesses, Brian, we want to be in the mid single digit business. And I think, obviously, our goal is to get back there. As you well know, we've got a couple of large businesses that are going to be below that and then it's getting the rest to be going above it. So I think as we transition into next year and certainly we're going to avoid giving 2019 guidance at this point in time, but certainly want to be accelerating as we come out of the year. Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then for follow-up, you talked about the recurring revenues within Cyno and the customer service and disposables piece there. I think you said, was up 10% and more than 25% of total sales. Can you talk specifically how you're doing that at this point and any other kind of targets that you would have for where you think that that should be in the near term? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. The simple goal is, we're starting to see some very nice uptick in the PAC key revenue. So still not enormous, but it's moving very nicely in the directions, as the SculpSure machines that are out there are starting to get more usage. And so I think it's all part of the broader play of getting our marketing efforts, driving people in to get SculpSure treatments, getting the PAC keys going. And certainly, over time, as we've talked about, new products that will bring more of a disposable element in addition to just a pure capital sale. We think over time that's going to become a much bigger part of the business, but that's going to be a multi-year journey, certainly. Operator : We'll now take a question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks. Congrats to Bob. I look forward to working with him at Agilent. Maybe just starting out on Cyno. I want to understand the range of outcomes here for MonaLisa. I know it's only 10% of Cyno sales, but it looked like the FDA only really had kind of two requests in their letter. So can you talk about maybe timelines to get back to them and how you see this playing out? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. You know what, our timeline will be get back to them within the 30-day window that they've requested. And let me give you a much bigger picture perspective on this as to why I think this is going to be a huge net positive for us over time. And this quarter, does it put a little damper on things we'll see, may very well be. But over time this is going to be very good. And Tycho, I think, you were around long enough to know my early days at Stryker, when the DOJ and Chris Christie came in and looked at the orthopedic industry practices and I will tell you, I remember standing in front of my first sales meeting as CEO at Stryker, where people thought I had my head in the sand, because a lot of our competitors were pursuing sales practices that we were not going to go down that path. And at the end of the day when the DOJ came and looked into the orthopedic industry and while it was painful to go through that, if you remember, the five major companies were looked at, and early on Stryker was losing market share when I took over. When we got a level playing field and the regulations got clearer and the scrutiny got better, in a level playing field, the best teams with the best products are going to win. And when Chris Christie settled that and you may recall the other four companies all got fined and all got deferred prosecution agreements and Stryker did not. And that started for the next 10 years, Stryker gaining market share. And that's exactly what we think will happen in this industry. So frankly, having a little scrutiny, while it can be a little bit of short term pain, we absolutely welcome it because I believe it will allow the cream to rise to the top, and that's fully where we expect to be. We are investing in the clinical trials. We're investing in the right people. We're building the right teams and really think it'll play well to us over time. Operator : We'll go to our next question from Jonathan Block with Stifel. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Two, probably, relatively quick questions. So the first one Bob maybe for you, looks like constant currency came up by roughly 100 bps or $30 million. So, fair to say is that approximately half attributable to blood screening and maybe the remaining Breast Health, I'm just curious on how you guys are viewing the upside guidance today versus three months ago? And then I've got a follow-up. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. I think you're thinking about it the right way, Jon. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then Steve maybe this one for you. It sounds like both Surgical and Medical Aesthetics are set to return to growth, I believe you said starting next quarter. You're adding some products to the bag in Medical Aesthetics. Can you talk about a rough growth profile that you expect these divisions to recapture and I just ask that because at one point these were both hyper growth assets, they've fallen on hard times. It seems like you got them back on track. So maybe you can talk about what you should expect, what we should expect near term and then maybe longer term? Thanks guys. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. I think let's take Surgical, which by the way if you recall, 4.5 years ago Surgical was a declining business. And then it got into some good solid mid-single digit growth, became hyper growth frankly when we had a competitive withdrawal in the category. I think that inflated it. The longer term growth rate for those categories, if you play it out, endometrial ablation is probably a flattish category truthfully, and then fibroid removal is probably a high singles. So the blended average of our Surgical business is probably a mid singles. And we ought to be every bit, as you know, we expect ourselves to grow faster than the categories we compete in. So I think Surgical getting back into the mid singles is where we feel good. We'd love it to be even better than that. And I think you'll see in the U.S., certainly in this coming quarter it will be a return to growth. We returned globally to growth or call it flattish this quarter. The U.S. has been sequentially getting stronger each over the last few quarters but it still declined less. We don't want to be talking about declining less. So we feel fully confident that team will return to growth. And then we look at Medical Aesthetics, we do believe we're on the verge of starting to turn that business into a market to better than market grower at what is probably right around the 10%-ish number. So we're not going to be satisfied unless we're going for a double digit growth on that as we come out of the year. Operator : We'll go to our next questioner who is Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Jaime L. Morgan - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. This is Jaime Morgan on for Rich. A quick question just to kind of follow-up on the Medical Aesthetics business. Where are you guys in terms of the sales organization? I know you said reps are in the midst of getting settling in and gaining confidence. So just looking for an update on the hiring progress, and any sort of commentary you can kind of give around what we should be expecting for total rep head count and the rep productivity and kind of the cadence of increases there? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, Jaime. Yeah, I'd say for the first time we are probably at about a normal level since over a year ago. So we've got a couple of openings here and there but it's now kind of in that standard range where you've always got a few openings and a little bit. And I think it's really the first time that we've been at that level. Now we still have people coming up to speed because the average tenure of many of the reps are still pretty junior in a lot of cases. But I think we feel really good about the progress we've made. And I think the part that's very encouraging is a lot of our legacy team, the folks who've been here, they are just not going to cover off the ball. So we have people really, really putting up very strong growth rates while they've been offset by some of the vacancies and everything else. So I think as we come into the fourth quarter, starting to feel better and better. Are we operating at 100% effectiveness yet? No. But do we have most of the positions filled with good people? Yes. Jaime L. Morgan - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, that's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on the TempSure product. I think you've indicated in the past that you guys are looking into expanded indications in both Surgical and Women's Health. I was wondering kind of if you could give us an update on your progress on either of those indications and potentially how much this could expand your market opportunity with this product? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. I think what we continue to be excited about is TempSure is probably one of the first, what I'll call, real platform technologies that we have gotten into. And we basically have a Surgical offshoot of that product that should be coming next year. So very excited by the initial sales of TempSure and then we have stuff coming behind it as we'll go into next year. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, Jaime, we just launched the Women's Health product literally in the last several weeks. Operator : We'll now go to a question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Congrats again Bob on the move. Steve, just want to think about Cynosure and into the fourth quarter there. Three different things kind of going on here. You've got traditional seasonality in the core Cynosure business. You've got improving momentum as you talked about on this call and you've got some MonaLisa headwind. But if you think about that business down quarter-over-quarter, can you just walk us through sort of the three components. How should we be thinking about sort of fourth quarter down sequentially in light of the sort of three interlocking dynamics going on? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, I think David, the way I would think about it is July and August typically in this industry are pretty light. So you do have a clear step down. I think our hope would be that the improved sales force and everything else could almost offset that. But you've also got the international component of that which will also be a little softer. And candidly MonaLisa is probably a slight little curveball. I think what it will probably do is put a pause on potentially some sales here in the short term and that might be the difference between deep down wanting to actually see it go up in the quarter or not. But I think being cautious while we are still getting out from \u2013 getting this business back on track I would assume that that's probably a slight more of a headwind this quarter that will play out well over the long term for us. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And Steve just two small quick ones, kind of, follow up. First is MonaLisa from a data perspective. There are a couple of studies ongoing for MonaLisa. I think one was suspended last year. I'm not sure what the other one is. But where are you on the clinical data front on MonaLisa? And then you mentioned Fuji in your prepared remarks. I wonder any thoughts on sort of expectations for 3D Performance in the low end of the market to the extent that they are in some way enjoined? Thanks so much. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. Another magical ability to get three questions into two, David. On the Fuji piece, I think, we feel good that competitively, frankly, even without the legal win our teams are being very aggressive and we continue to get a lot of wins. Certainly, they were going incredibly deep on pricing and does that create some opportunities for us? Frankly, there were some of the accounts that we're just not going to go that low. So it may allow us to pick up some additional business in that arena here as we go forward. And there's \u2013 the first one is really momentum in Breast Health. There's a lot of momentum in our Breast Health business right now that we really like what's going on there. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Steve, can I add just something to that. David, to that point, the two newest gantries that we launched just recently, the 3Dimensions and 3D Performance is just at the lower end, represented roughly 50% of all the 3D gantries that we launched or that we sold in the quarter. And we still continue to have a very high capture rate of new opportunities. So when we look at the U.S. we believe that when we look at new placements, we're still getting in excess of eight out of every ten of those. And so, we feel very good, to Steve's point, around the competitive nature and really not beyond by price, but it's the clinical benefits and the features that these products provide. And I think that that's what's been a hallmark of that team and it will continue to do so, and I think we feel very good about what they are doing as they expand their offering beyond just gantries. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: And to the other question on MonaLisa. We're actually fairly deep in discussions with FDA about deeper studies for MonaLisa Touch, things that we haven't discussed exactly but very deep into the discussions. And frankly, it's why we extended the partnership. As we announced, I think, on the last quarterly call, we see this being a great product over time, but we have that more modest expectations because we have been limited, as you know, in terms of where we've been selling it. And we wanted to generate additional clinical data for the product to strengthen the claim structure around it. So we're actually been deep in discussions with them on that. Operator : We'll now take a question from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Steve and Bob I was hoping you could give us some color on operating margins as we look into 2019, and what are some of the puts and takes that we should be thinking about heading into the new year? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Jack, I think we want to be careful not to get into 2019 guidance, but I think on a high level, you know what, gross margins probably not going to move dramatically, because of the international business continues to grow at a lower gross margin, probably not going to be seeing the huge wins that we had in the previous years. They're also \u2013 depending on what happens with the tariffs that could be a slight headwind to gross margin that we would seek to try to make up as much as we can, but dealing with that. I think we'll get a little bit of OpEx leverage. So whereas \u2013 that as we grow that's got to be the ability to start to drive a little bit more operating margin expansion. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thank you. And I was hoping you could just elaborate on your commentary around some of the increased deal activity you're seeing in the space. Does that stand across all of your businesses? And related to that, how does the Faxitron acquisition fit into how you think you can broaden the Breast Health segment over time? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yes, great question. We are seeing much -- many more deals that I'd say have the profile of a Faxitron. And I think as you know we made an organizational change really at the end of last calendar year where we eliminated the Chief Operating Officer. Me having direct access to the Presidents now of the divisions they're really starting to ramp up the activity and just our whole corporate team supporting that it's just, it's a very different outlook. And I think they're starting to see some things and we're looking at a lot more things in the flow that are what I'd call much more the true tuck-ins that supplement our existing businesses. As it relates to Breast Health we've been looking at the continuum of patient care and how we continue to build out from the strength we have in mammography. And we've been seeing the growth of the breast conserving surgery area and it's such an adjacency. It's right for us to be able to go in and have a bigger play. We have a very small product in that space today, so we've got the knowledge, we've got the presence. But this will allow us to build out. And that -- these are the kind of tuck-ins that we really want to be doing. And I would say frankly in each division right now we're starting to see some of them and we've got them coming forth. So I'm not going to say we're going to have one ready to go every quarter or whatever else. It's never that linear or clean. But I can tell you the teams are really starting to surface some good things. And two years ago or even a year ago we just want to bring many good ideas forth. Operator : We'll now take a question from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Anthony for Raj. Hello, sorry I was on mute. Anthony for Raj. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just back to MonaLisa a bit. There's a little bit of revenue mix in there. I'm just wondering expectations into the second half and then maybe a little bit more detail on maybe the contents of the FDA inquiries, I mean it looks like they were certainly, there's a focus on marketing practices but is there a chance that this actually bifurcates going forward in favor of Cynosure? That will be my first question. And then just on Breast Health, it looks like there was a patent suit win specifically against Fuji. So just an update on sort of share shifts within Breast Health and maybe how that particular situation with Fuji plays out. Is that a tailwind as you go forward here in the second half? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. I think on the MonaLisa piece, it's really very early to know how it will play out for the other companies and everything else. We're just going to focus on ourselves. I think we continue to feel good about MonaLisa. We are very willing to invest in the clinical studies. And by the way none of us are perfect. I'm sure between legacy stuff (54:50) have you slightly over promoted here or there. We'll clean anything like that up just as I did earlier in my Stryker days, and then we'll move forward. And again feel really good about the product and our commitment to the clinical expertise. As it relates to Fuji, frankly they haven't been that big of a competitor. Most of what we're competing with day-to-day is really GE and Siemens institutions. And I think we continue to feel really good about the wins we're continuing to get. You don't grow our Breast Health business the way we have been doing now for a number of years, post all the concerns about the cliff without continuing to take market share. So I think, Fuji, I put in the nuisance category. And they are certainly there and we hope to have them permanently withdrawn from the products that are infringing our patents and that'll certainly help. But day-in day-out we're also still competing against some very formidable competitors in GE and Siemens. But we like our chances. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hello and good afternoon. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Derik. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Hey. So I'm going to see if I can sneak in three like Doug. Number one, can you \u2013 how fast was Faxitron growing? And did you bless Quirk's (56:19) $4.5 million number for Q4? Number two, are you still comfortable with sort of the mid-teens growth in the legacy business OUS? And I'm just curious, have you seen any sort of like buying ahead of the tariffs in China? Just wondering if you've seen any unusual dynamics in the market ahead of that. And, yeah, I'll just leave it there. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Great. Hey. I don't think we're going to necessarily disclose the Faxitron growth rates but solid. And we kind of ignored Bill's... Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: And faster than the current company. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. It's accretive to our growth rate. Bill's number was probably slightly high, I would guess, just where we are in the quarter and where they are in terms of, as we take it over. But I think feel good about a full year number. In terms of the base business growth rates, I would not endorse mid-teens international growth for our base business going forward. I think we've had seven straight quarters of big stuff. But now we're really starting to get against big comps and especially stacked comps. We still expect our international business clearly to be growth accretive. We also picked up, as you know, a couple of distributor acquisitions. So I think that'll come \u2013 certainly slow down as we've annualized all of that, but continue to feel really good about the growth rate of our international business being accretive to the company. And finally, I don't \u2013 we have not seen any buying in or stocking in from China. I wish our business was bigger for us to realize that kind of an impact in China. But I think nothing noticeable at this point. Operator : We'll go now to Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions and congratulations, Bob. Wanted to start with the international Diagnostics business. Steve, you indicated not to expect mid-teens growth next year. Certainly you had a significant benefit from currency in the international business. But I guess just broadly or high level, can you speak about the penetration rates and how you think you're competing across Europe and how much growth you see there, just from a market share perspective? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, Mark. Let me be clear. My comment to Derik, unless I misunderstood his question, was about our total international business growing at mid teens. I think we would expect our Molecular Diagnostics business to continue to be a very healthy grower internationally. And again not ready to give guidance but my comment was more about our total business. I think we feel good about what's going on in Europe. We continue to place Panthers. Our team has gotten a lot stronger there at selling. And as the menu builds out feeling really good about additional opportunities in Europe. And again even though we are going against some very formidable competitors in that part of the world, we are getting some very nice wins and expect that to continue. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Got it. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: So, Mark, to that point I mean when we look at our market shares there, we have a lot of opportunity to gain market share over time in Europe and in Asia as our menus expand. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Got it. And just a two parter follow-up. The Breast Health gantries, would you say that that number of placements is roughly stable or maybe flat sequentially, or are you seeing an uptake there? And then secondly on annuity per analyzer on Panther, I think you guys were looking for maybe high single digit growth there, any update there? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. So Mark on the Breast Health gantries, we were up sequentially but it's still within the range that we've had been \u2013 we've been saying between 250 and 300 (01:00:30) per quarter, and it was in that range. For the annuity on the Diagnostics Panther system that continues to increase. That's one of the things that's real strong growth driver for that business going forward. We saw a nice rebound this quarter as we expected. With the additional menu that's coming on we would expect that opportunity to continue to grow. Operator : We'll now take questions from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : Hey, thanks for squeezing me back in. And I just want to go through the fourth quarter maintenance (01:01:10) guidance assumptions. Just Bob, high level, so, what is the FX that's baked into that number for Q4? And if I understood all the different numbers, it's about $9.5 million headwind from the Diagnostics royalty roll-off, which is not going to repeat. There's some contribution, let's call it, $3 million to $5 million from Faxitron. And blood is going to be about $8 million to $9 million in Q4. Is that correct all those numbers I had? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yes. You're in the ballpark, Vijay. And what I would say is when we think about where we were from last guide, the FX is hurting us by roughly $8 million. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : And that's all going to be in Q4 right, that $8 million headwind in Q4? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: That's the Q4 number. That's correct. We had roughly about $3 million in Q3 relative to when we gave guidance and that guidance comprehended \u2013 was impacted roughly by about $8 million in Q4. And we've included that into the latest guidance. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : And got you. And blood is coming much better than expected, right now. Obviously that's been a headwind to margins. I mean if I understood Steve's comments, it looks like maybe very slight margin expansion for 2019. Is that sort of \u2013 it looks like maybe the Street is a little aggressive on margins, op margins for 2019? Thank you. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Again, we're probably not going to get into all the details. I think what Steve was talking about was as we look at our business, look the gross margin line is probably not going to see a whole lot of new expansion as we look at our international business growing faster. The impact of tariffs as they come to pass. That being said, we do believe that we have the levers necessary to drive operating margin improvement and we'll give more guidance on the fourth quarter call. Operator : We will now go to Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. And I'll keep it to one and bring the average down. So... Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Jayson. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: You're welcome. Just a bigger picture margin question, specifically on the R&D spend. It's trended lower as a percent of sales over the last few years. In the quarter it was frankly lower than it's been in some time. Steve, is there a point in the life cycle of this business where you have to ramp the R&D spend to fund the organic growth profile, or should we think of 6.5% to 7% of sales as the right level going forward? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. I think, it came down a bit largely because the heavy investment in the virology programs and Diagnostics, which was a huge clinical program came down. I would not expect that to leverage much more. I think it's kind of \u2013 it's almost like the business development stuff. Now that we're getting \u2013 we've got better people in place and everything else starting to see some other projects that we can work on. And I think that will be an area of probably less leverage going forward, because we don't want to \u2013 we want to make sure we're investing for the future. And it could even tick up ever sort of slightly probably as we go forward. But again hopefully we're able to keep it at that level and invest for the future, grow the top line, grow the R&D budget, and good things keep happening. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: Operator, I think we have time for maybe two more questions. Operator : We'll now go to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks for letting me get a follow-up in. Steve, I want to... Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, sorry, thought you got cut off earlier. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's okay. The whole notion of getting back to mid single digit growth, I know you don't want to necessarily comment too much on next year. But really the question is, how much is contingent on new product driving the recovery back to mid single digit growth next year? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: They'll certainly play a role. And again we'll talk much more on the next call when we give guidance for next year. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, Tycho I think to Steve's point, I mean without speaking to 2019, I mean one of the things that we talked about and I think it's being shown is the improvement of our R&D pipeline. We launched several new products in the quarter, but when you think about across our product portfolio, the expansion of our R&D, our menu in the Diagnostics business really helping drive growth there, obviously, with what we've been able to do on the Breast Health business with the new gantries but also increasingly some additional products in surround and then even in the Surgical and the Medical Aesthetics area where we're doing some nice distribution deals, and then on Surgical some nice tuck ins. That is the way I would expect the cadence to continue going forward, those things continue to be a bigger and more important piece, and actually creates vibrancy in our product portfolio. And I would expect you to see that going forward. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We will take our final question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. So I was hoping you could elaborate on the emerging market program you have for your Molecular business. I mean, your competitors in molecular actually do quite a bit of business in emerging markets. And so can you talk about how you'd size that opportunity and what you expect timing would be and when we can start to see some contribution from those efforts? Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, Dan as you well said, a lot of our competitors are much more entrenched there. We're in the early stages. And I'd probably put it as it's going to be not significant probably even as we go into 2019. But we're putting our foot in the door. We're building the relationships. Obviously in the announcement last week with the Clinton Health Care, Health Access Initiative, I think it's going to go a long way to putting us on the map there. It's probably going to yield bigger benefits in call it 2020 and beyond. But I think we feel good about the initial start that we're getting in there. And we finally have the menu and the system in terms of Panthers that we can make a difference there. It'll be probably lower price and lower margin as we also try to do good but overall feel like that will be a very good place for us to be as well. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.: I think the other thing it underscores is the strength of our leadership there. I would tell you two years ago, this was not something that would have been possible within Hologic. So our EMEA leadership team being able to really work with that in conjunction with our Diagnostics partners hereon in the U.S. I just speak to what Steve has said a long \u2013 a lot and truly believe that leadership makes a difference. And I think that is as much of a symbol as anything else. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: I think a very fitting and final comment for Bob as he signs off. And again a huge thanks to Bob and welcome to Karleen. Many of you will get to know her in the years ahead. We wish Bob, all the best as he moves forth and thank you everybody for listening to our call. And keep watching as we keep making this company better and better. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. Have a good evening.",

LLC Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Hologic, Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Keith, and I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Please go ahead, sir. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Keith. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through November 23rd. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. It was a solid quarter overall as total revenue of $813.5 million and earnings per share of $0.58 both finished within our guidance ranges. As we announced in September, continued strength in our legacy businesses offset lower than expected sales of Cynosure products due to the FDA letter on our MonaLisa Touch laser and our decision to suspend marketing of TempSure Vitalia handpieces and probes. Our largest businesses performed well in the fourth quarter, continuing a trend that emerged over the course of the year. Growth in our domestic Breast Health business improved for the fifth consecutive quarter. Molecular growth accelerated excluding non-recurring royalties from a year ago. International sales increased solidly and U.S. Surgical returned to growth. And just after quarter-end, we completed a tuck-in acquisition that will further strengthen and expand our Breast Health franchise. Before we discuss these details, let me step back and comment on the company as a whole since we're marking the end of our fiscal year. As I look back across 2018, there is no doubt that we are a much healthier company today than a year ago and that each of our major businesses is stronger. In Breast Health, domestic growth improved over the course of 2018 driven by new products and strong execution. In Diagnostics, we placed more Panthers, launched more tests, and solidified our relationships with our largest customers. In Surgical, a revamped and more competitive sales force helped quarterly results improve steadily. In Medical Aesthetics, we dramatically improved our commercial capabilities although the numbers don't show it yet. Internationally, we built a solid infrastructure for sustainable growth with new leadership, new products, and new capabilities. And finally, as we eliminated all of the convertible debt from our balance sheet, we enhanced our business development efforts, resulting in the acquisitions of Faxitron Bioptics and Focal Therapeutics. We have now completed four tuck-in deals successfully and expect more ahead. So overall, we made major progress since restructuring our leadership early in the year, and we enter 2019 with improved momentum. Now let's discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail. Revenue of $813.5 million grew 1.3% on a reported basis or 1.7% in constant currency. Let me remind you that these percentages understate our true growth as the prior-year period benefited from higher sales from our divested Blood Screening business and $9.5 million of non-recurring royalty revenue in Molecular Diagnostics, which more than offset an extra selling day. In terms of geography, our legacy International franchises demonstrated robust 10.4% growth in the fourth quarter, our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth excluding Cynosure. Our Molecular Diagnostics business had an exceptional quarter internationally, and our Breast Health and Surgical business contributed nicely as well reflecting the broad-based improvements we have made in recent years. Including OUS sales of Cynosure products, which declined in the period, total International sales were $198.4 million, still a solid increase of 6.3%. In the United States, positive trends that emerged in the third quarter continued in the fourth as growth rates improved sequentially in our Breast Health, Diagnostics, and Surgical franchises. Now let me provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results in the fourth quarter. Our largest business, Breast Health, is clearly in a very different position than a year ago and has reemerged as an important growth driver defying external concerns about a cyclical decline. Global Breast Health sales totaled $322.2 million, a robust increase of 7.4%, including about $5 million from Faxitron. Internationally, we continue to perform well with sales growth in the mid-teens. In addition, the much larger U.S. Breast business again strengthened in the quarter and posted growth of 5.4%, our best growth rate in seven quarters. We couldn't be more proud of the team for building a diversified, sustainable growth business to overcome the boom-bust product cycles of the past. Their strategic success was evident this quarter as growth was broad-based, encompassing mammography, Interventional, our new breast surgery franchise, and service. At the core, sales of imaging products increased 6.2% globally in the quarter. It's clear that the introduction of our new clinically differentiated 3Dimensions and 3D Performance Systems have not only revitalized the market as a whole but helped us continue to gain market share. Since it's the end of our fiscal year, I'll let you know that we shipped nearly 1,100 3D systems in the United States over the last four quarters, down just slightly compared to our placements in fiscal 2017, validating our stronger-for-longer forecast. Cumulatively, by year-end we had shipped more than 5,700 3D systems in the United States and are working to upgrade this installed base with new software and hardware. At the same time, we still have runway ahead for additional placements, as customers, patients, and payers continue to recognize the ability of our systems to detect more invasive cancers while simultaneously reducing unnecessary callbacks. For example, 3D is only about 60% penetrated in our own installed base, which means that we still have nearly 4,000 2D units in the field. And overall, we estimate that 3D is about 50% penetrated in the domestic entry market as a whole including competitor units. Sales of Interventional Breast products also showed robust growth again, increasing 15.9% globally and reaching double digits for the fourth consecutive quarter. Growth here is being driven by important new products such as our Brevera biopsy system, but also by our sales force leveraging the breadth of our portfolio to partner more comprehensively with customers. To reinforce this last point, we wanted to highlight the tuck-in acquisition of Focal which closed in early October. Combined with our recent acquisition of Faxitron, Focal strengthens our position in the rapidly growing market for breast-conserving surgery and expands our ability to help women diagnosed with breast cancer throughout their continuum of care from screening through treatment. Focal's main product is an innovative marker called BioZorb, an implantable, three-dimensional marker that helps clinicians overcome challenges in breast-conserving surgery. From a financial perspective, acquiring Focal is accretive to our revenue growth rate and gross margins, broadens our recurring revenue base and provides an attractive return on invested capital. In addition, combining Focal and Faxitron, then layering on Hologic's much greater resources and capabilities should help accelerate growth going forward. Our Breast Health division has never been stronger than it is today based on a clinically-differentiated core of mammography systems, multiple new products built around this core, and two complementary tuck-in acquisitions. Now, let's turn to Diagnostics, where revenue of $288.9 million declined 0.5%. As discussed, we had some unusual items affecting Diagnostics growth this quarter, so the headline number does not represent what's actually a very healthy business. For example, Molecular sales of $158 million grew 3.4%. But if you exclude roughly $9.5 million of non-recurring royalty revenue from the prior year period, underlying growth was actually 10.2%, accelerating for the second consecutive quarter. Internationally, Molecular grew in double digits for the ninth time in 10 quarters. And in the U.S., although we already enjoy high market shares in key assay categories, Molecular still grew a healthy mid-single-digit rate, excluding the royalty revenue from a year ago. Sales of Aptima, women's health and virology assays on our market-leading Panther system, remain the primary growth drivers in our Molecular business. Over the course of 2018, we shipped more than 200 more Panthers to lab customers around the world, bringing our cumulative total to more than 1,500 units, more than 40% of which are now outside the United States. Importantly, utilization of these instruments has continued to grow as new assays emerge from our R&D pipeline and as we partner with customers to drive overall testing volume. Average revenue per Panther now exceeds $225,000 a year on a global basis and grew at a low double-digit rate in fiscal 2018. Moving on, cytology and perinatal sales of $118.0 million declined 1.2% in the fourth quarter. In the United States, cytology growth remains challenged due to our high market shares and longer cervical cancer testing intervals. However, during the fourth quarter, we were pleased to see the United States Preventive Services Task Force issue their final cervical cancer testing guidelines. These final guidelines reversed an earlier draft and retained an A grade for Pap + HPV testing or co-testing in women between the ages of 30 and 65. Both tests are crucial because data from multiple large studies prove that co-testing identifies more cervical pre-cancers and cancers than either test used alone. So the final USPSTF recommendations remove a near-term concern for investors, but more importantly ensure that women will continue to have access to the most commonly used cervical cancer screening method in the United States, an approach that we believe is simple, highly accurate and cost-effective. Elsewhere in Diagnostics, revenue related to our divested Blood Screening business totaled $12.9 million, an expected decline of 28.3% that depressed growth rates for our Diagnostics division and the company as a whole. Before we move on, we wanted to address a concern some of you had about our Diagnostics business. While there has been outsized focus on a single lab contract, we've actually been working diligently to solidify our business with our two largest customers. And I'm pleased to let you know that in recent weeks, we have signed a multi-year deal to continue providing cytology and molecular tests and instrumentation to one of these customers. In addition, we have agreed on terms for a multiyear extension of our supply contract with the other customer and expect to finalize this contract in the next few weeks. As you know, we don't discuss the details of individual contracts, but I will tell you that we are pleased with this outcome and have incorporated the financial effects in our 2019 guidance. Most importantly, we look forward to continuing to work with both customers to grow our shared businesses for years to come. Now let's cover our GYN Surgical division, where sales of $107.4 million grew 3.1%. Over the course of 2018, Surgical steadily improved each quarter and returned to meaningful growth in the fourth as we predicted in our last call. As we have discussed, our new leadership team is improving the culture of our Surgical sales force and we are beginning to see the benefits of their more aggressive competitive approach. MyoSure, which has become the largest product line in the Surgical franchise, continued recent trends of strong performance, growing low-double digits in the quarter. NovaSure continued to show modest sequential improvement, declining less than in the third quarter, but overall sales were still down mid-single digits compared to the prior year. Finally, we should highlight that we launched our Fluent fluid management system in the fourth quarter and are seeing good early interest from customers. Apart from these operational results in Surgical, in recent weeks we also settled a long-standing patent dispute with Smith & Nephew related to MyoSure, agreeing to pay them $34.8 million and a small ongoing royalty. We are pleased to put this matter behind us so we can focus more fully on growing the business. Now let's turn to Medical Aesthetics where sales of $70.6 million declined 12.9%. As we disclosed in September before the Morgan Stanley Conference, Cynosure sales were negatively affected by the FDA letter on certain women's health procedures and our voluntary decision to suspend marketing of our TempSure Vitalia product. Specifically, sales in the fourth quarter were more than $15 million lower than initially expected due to refunds and rebates associated with prior sales of Vitalia handpieces, unused probes, and TempSure systems, as well as reduced MonaLisa Touch sales. Normalizing for these effects, revenue would have been roughly in-line with expectations, reflecting a domestic sales force that is coming up to speed in what remains an attractive growth market. We have adjusted our marketing messages for MonaLisa Touch in response to FDA's concerns and are working collaboratively with the agency to design the clinical trials that hopefully will lead to more specific indications and labeling. We continue to believe that a higher level of regulatory scrutiny will benefit us over time so we welcome a more level playing field on which we can communicate the tremendous value that products like MonaLisa Touch provide. To round out the revenue discussion briefly, Skeletal sales of $24.4 million grew 1.4% as we continue to see strong sales of our Horizon system for bone density testing and human performance management. So, to wrap up, we posted very good financial results in the quarter with improving momentum in Breast Health, Molecular Diagnostics, and Surgical, and continued strength internationally. We logged some nice successes in our Diagnostics business, both with the USPSTF and our largest customers, and completed a second attractive tuck-in acquisition for Breast Health. We are clearly exiting 2018 on a much better trajectory than when we began the year, and we look forward to continued growth in 2019. Now I'll turn the call over to Karleen. Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been a pleasure to meet some of you in the first few months as CFO and I look forward to getting to know many more of you in the coming months. In my remarks today, I'm going to walk through our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, then finish with our initial financial guidance for 2019. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Steve mentioned, we closed out fiscal 2018 with a good fourth quarter. Revenue and EPS both finished in-line with our guidance. A strong performance from our core businesses offset a negative surprise with Cynosure's women's health products. We also strategically deployed capital in accordance with our stated priorities. We completed the acquisition of Focal Therapeutics, a nice tuck-in opportunity to further expand in breast-conserving surgery, and capitalized on our share repurchase authorization. With that introduction, let me start by reviewing our P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margins of 61.8% decreased 230 basis points due primarily to geographic and product sales mix, non-recurring royalties included in the prior-year period, and refunds and rebates associated with our TempSure Vitalia products. Total operating expenses of $265.9 million decreased 3.6% as we continue to balance growth investments with a desire to drive operating leverage. For example, even though research and development expenses were lower than a year ago, we have the best new product portfolio in recent memory. We have significantly improved the talent of our teams and the productivity of our efforts. Operating margin of 29.1% declined 70 basis points in the fourth quarter. However, normalizing for the Vitalia refunds and rebates, as well as non-recurring royalties in the prior-year period, operating margins would have grown about 140 basis points. Overall, our operating profitability remains very healthy and we continue to see opportunities to improve further. Finally, net margins of 19.5% increased 170 basis points as the factors just discussed were offset by improvements in our effective tax rate. All of this led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 within our guidance range and consistent with the forecast we provided just before the Morgan Stanley Conference. Steve mentioned that Cynosure revenue was more than $15 million less than expected. I want to remind you that TempSure refunds and rebates also directly reduced profit in the quarter, lowering EPS by almost $0.02. Before we move on to our 2019 guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. We continue to generate strong cash flows that provide us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. During our fiscal year, we generated $687.3 million in free cash, excluding $60 million of tax recapture payments associated with the extinguishment of the company's convertible debt. We used some of this cash flow to repurchase 2.3 million shares of stock for $88.5 million in the fourth quarter, and also completed the Focal acquisition in early October for a purchase price of $125 million. At the end of the fourth quarter, our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, stood at 2.6 times, slightly below our year-ago level despite all the capital deployment that occurred in fiscal 2018. We remain comfortable around this level, recognizing that this could fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and buyback activity. Finally, in the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $263.3 million increased slightly compared to the prior year. Now I'd like to cover our initial non-GAAP financial guidance for fiscal 2019. Before I do, let me remind you there are several puts and takes in comparing our 2019 guidance to our actual 2018 results. In terms of headwind, revenues from our divested Blood Screening business is expected to continue declining significantly in 2019. And foreign exchange rates at recent levels would also be a drag on reported results. In addition, based on our 2019 holiday schedule, we technically have two fewer selling days than in 2018, although this is not expected to have a big impact. On the other hand, tailwinds to reported growth in 2019 will include the acquisitions of Faxitron and Focal, both of which are off to a good start. As you update your forecast, we would encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance range at this early stage. We've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both potential upside and downside. We anticipate fiscal 2019 will be a solid year for Hologic overall. At the highest level, we are forecasting constant currency revenue growth roughly in the 3% to 4% range with EPS growth about double that. Specifically, we anticipate sales of $3.29 billion to $3.335 billion in 2019 with reported growth rates between 2.2% and 3.6%. Based on recent exchange rates, this translates into constant currency growth of 2.8% to 4.2%, better than our run rate exiting 2018. We do expect tuck-in acquisitions to be an increasingly important part of Hologic's story going forward and therefore encourage you to focus on these reported numbers in constant currency. But as you do think about our underlying organic growth rate, I would point out that based on recent exchange rates, the headwinds and tailwinds I previously discussed basically offset each other next year. Said another way, organic growth rates should be pretty similar to constant currency growth rates in 2019 depending on how you model the various components. In terms of geography, we expect our U.S. business to grow in the low-single-digit range in fiscal 2019, an improvement over last year while absorbing all of the decline in Blood Screening sales. International revenue should grow in the high-single digits on a constant currency basis, slightly less than 2018 as we have annualized most of the benefit from our two European distributor acquisitions. In terms of divisional growth in 2019, our guidance anticipates that most of our businesses will grow in the low- to mid-single-digit range except for Breast Health, which we expect to grow in the mid-single digits. In Diagnostics, Molecular should continue to lead the charge in 2019 behind Panther, Panther Fusion, and increased utilization of more than a dozen women's health, virology, and respiratory assays. We anticipate approximately $30 million to $35 million of revenue related to our divested Blood Screening business much lower than in 2018. In Breast Health, growth will be driven by multiple new mammography, biopsy, and surgical products that we have discussed, including those from Faxitron and Focal, our International businesses, and a large service annuity that now totaled well over $400 million annually. In Surgical, we expect growth to be driven by the continued expansion of MyoSure, more modest declines in NovaSure, new products such as Fluent in International. In Medical Aesthetics, growth from a stabilized and increasingly productive sales force and new products including TempSure which was recently cleared for surgical use. As Steve mentioned, we do not expect any revenue from TempSure Vitalia in 2019, and we expect MonaLisa Touch sales to be significantly less than in 2018 given the regulatory environment. In terms of profitability, we forecast gross margins to improve slightly compared to 62.7% in the full year 2018. As we have previously discussed, while the expansion of our International business adds gross margin dollars to our income statement, it does put pressure on gross margin percentage. So geography mix will offset most of the gross margin benefit we expect from operational improvements and continued adoption of new products. In terms of operating expenses, we expect to continue to show strong leverage that helps drive healthy growth in operating margin percentage and ultimately EPS. Below the line, we expect other expenses net to be materially greater in fiscal 2019 than the $132 million we posted in 2018, primarily from higher forecasted interest rates. All this leads to forecasted earnings per share between $2.38 and $2.42 in 2019. This represents reported growth of between 6.7% and 8.5%, with the understanding that EPS growth would be slightly higher if not for the diminishing contribution from our divested Blood Screening business. This guidance assumes a full year tax rate of approximately 23%, flat to 2018, and diluted shares outstanding of about 276 million for the year. We also expect to continue generating robust cash flows in 2019 with free cash flow estimated around $700 million, excluding one-time items such as acquisition-related tax payments and legal settlements. Now let's cover guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect revenues of $800 million to $815 million in the quarter. This reflects reported revenue growth of 1.1% to 3% and constant currency growth of 1.7% to 3.6%. We forecast non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.55 to $0.57 in the first quarter. This represents 0% to 3.6% growth on a reported basis. As a reminder, there is some seasonality to keep in mind in our first fiscal quarter. While Surgical tends to have a seasonally strong quarter, this benefit is offset by Breast Health, which is seasonally weaker due to limited installations during RSNA and over the holidays. In addition, on the expense side, remember that our U.S. and European sales meeting take place in the first quarter and that this will be the first full quarter to include expenses from Faxitron and Focal. Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that we are pleased with how we finished 2018 with our Breast Health, Molecular Diagnostics and International businesses driving solid growth. We continue to generate industry-leading cash flows and put that cash to good use with a second tuck-in acquisition and share repurchases. We have stronger momentum as we enter 2019 and anticipate a better year as all these trends continue and as our Surgical and Medical Aesthetics franchises return to growth. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Raj. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : So, yeah, thanks for the detail on the guidance for next year. Maybe I could start with Molecular. I know you didn't want to give us too much detail around the new contracts you signed, but you had a very strong quarter here in the fourth quarter, up over 10% on an underlying basis. When you think about that business into the next fiscal year, I mean, should we think about it in the 5% range? Or really, maybe you can help us in terms of how to think about that for the next year. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. I think that probably makes sense on the Molecular business, Raj. I think we feel very good about where that's going. That clearly would be a mid-singles. Then, obviously, the total Diagnostics business, probably a little less because of the cytology piece. And if anything, we might hope to beat that on the Molecular side, but we like where we're going right now with it. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Maybe just one other point of clarification. You noted \u2013 and again, looking at my notes here, but you said the commercial capabilities in Aesthetics has improved and you're not seeing it in the numbers yet. And I'm curious if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail on it in terms of what you're referring to there. Is it the sales force that's finally stopped hemorrhaging folks or \u2013 again, because it remains a bit of a drag here, so when we think about it improving, what should we really be thinking about? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, Raj, it's great. It's really referring to both sales and marketing, but especially the sales team. We came into the quarter, and I would tell you, July was off to a tremendous start, which showed we've got the team and the products in place. We feel really, really good about where that team is. Really, only a year after Kevin Thornal went in as President. And I will tell you in late July, I was really looking forward to this earnings call because I knew it was going to be the one that we were going to be reporting strong double-digit growth based on what we could see already happening in the quarter, and then the FDA and TempSure letter. But we're seeing those results and especially what was going on at that point in time. And then as we look at, frankly, the territories that were, call it, more vacant a year ago, we now have good people in. And so we certainly feel much better about where we are. I'd say we've now got a normalized sales force and feel really good and frankly, still attracting some very good people coming over. Operator : We'll take our next question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Two questions from me. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Isaac. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. One on Diagnostics, one on Aesthetics. On Diagnostics, just to try and close a book here on the large contracts, could you try and give us some quantification as to the impacts so that we can get a better sense of the underlying growth in the business if we exclude the impact of the new contracts? Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Isaac, it's Mike. I'm sorry to play traffic cop on that one a little bit, but, I mean, we're really not at any liberty to talk about the economics or the specifics of those things. As you can imagine, that's pretty highly competitive information and highly confidential. We want to keep it to ourselves. We did, as we said in our script, work that into our 2019 guidance, and we're pleased with how it worked out. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. And I think just to build \u2013 simply, if you do think about it, we're guiding our Diagnostics business, call it, likely low- to mid-single-digit growth. Clearly, Molecular is going to be better than that and cytology is probably a pretty flattish business, if that can help a little bit. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. No, that's helpful. Thank you. And then on the Aesthetics side, with that $7 million in refunds and rebates, just trying to get a sense of, is there anything left there that we should expect in the next quarter or two as that closes out? Or is that pretty much all in the past now? Just trying to make sure that as we look at the sequential trend in Aesthetics, that there are no surprises left before it kind of gets back to the growth mode. Thank you. Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Isaac, it's Karleen. Yeah, I think we've captured everything. I think our teams here did a really nice job. They actually connected with each of over 160 TempSure customers and believe we've captured all in the fourth quarter and don't have any exposure as to prior-period sales moving forward. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. I'll start with Breast Health. Steve, a couple of questions there. You mentioned the upgrade opportunity. I'm wondering if you could kind of flesh that out a little bit. Are you starting to kind of replace some of the early 3D systems or were you specifically talking about 2D? And then just a little bit of color on performance of the new products, 3Dimensions and 3D Performance, to what degree are those getting into new customers? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, the first part is both software upgrades to existing 3D systems that we'd already sold. We are also upgrading certainly the later generations of 2Ds that we can upgrade, as well with 3D, that's also a software change so that does factor in. In terms of the second part, 3D Performance and 3Dimensions, I think we're just really pleased that you go back a year ago and we're a little bit on our back heels. And as those products launched, being able to get our messaging out, we're seeing very good uptake. And you've seen it certainly in the MQSA data but also in our overall results here where our Breast Health business really strengthening through the year. And I think we feel really good based on orders as to where that business should be headed this year. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just one follow-up. On guidance, can you clarify what's embedded for acquisition contributions in terms of a dollar amount? And then on NovaSure, when do you think that kind of bottoms out and starts to recover? Thanks. Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. So in terms of the acquisitions, obviously Faxitron and Focal are both included. I think we've talked about combined historically they did about $40 million and we're looking for them to probably grow in the double-digit range. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. First off, Steve, can you give us an update on the competitive intensity you're seeing in Surgical? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. I don't think it's anything different than what we've felt over the last few years. There's always a little pockets here or there, but I would not say anything meaningfully different, Dan. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then for my follow-up. On the body component of your Aesthetics business, I actually thought that might have been a little bit stronger given the positive commentary and from prior calls. Can you help you reconcile the two? Is it just seasonality or was there something else that happened in that category? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. I think we did have a tougher comp. That we had the submental launch that happened right at the end of the previous year in that quarter so we got a lot of revenue writing at the end. So you got a little bit of that. And frankly some of the icons, some of the other products just got a little hotter in the quarter, and I think people were having some success there. Anything more? Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.: No, I think that's right. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Great. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys, congrats on a Steady Eddie quarter. So, Steve, maybe I want to start on the Diagnostics piece. And if I look at the guidance, gross margins being up year-on-year, relative to what the Street \u2013 I think the Street was overtly nervous on maybe large contract renewals, and it looks like this is coming much better than expected. But I guess my question is, is there upside here? Because when you look at Dx, in your commentaries, you said Molecular is growing and accelerating. It was actually up 10%. Why shouldn't we expect these trends to continue into 2019? And as you mentioned, some of the conversations you have with the large customers, was there any \u2013 should we be thinking about the virology opportunity amongst your large customers? Any thoughts on that I think will be helpful. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. I think we feel good about where Molecular is going right now but don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. A 10.2% quarter, we're about ready to say that that is a sustainable number, probably not. Would it be something we want to shoot for? You bet. But our International business was off the charts strong as that's been building up. But I don't think the sustainability of that \u2013 we'd probably be careful saying at this point in time because particularly International, we've grown International 9 out of the last 10 quarters in very strong double digits. And that, as we start to go against those comps, it's starting to be a very meaningful part of the business. That's going to get tougher, I think, in the road forward. But I think overall we feel very, very good about where it's going. Yeah. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI : And then maybe one on guidance here. Karleen, and maybe, Steve, for you too as well, I guess when you look at the parts of gross margin (00:43:34) maybe up slightly year-on-year, but if we're looking at higher tax rate, higher below-the-line expenses, are we now looking at operating margins being flat or even expanding at the high end to get to the EPS range? And when you think about the free cash in a tremendous free cash here. So, Steve, when you think about priorities for free cash deployment, is this all debt paydown given higher interest rate or should we be thinking of tuck-in M&As? Thank you. Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.: Vijay... Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: It's like nine questions in... Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: That was a world record for follow-up. Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.: So maybe I'll start on kind of the assumptions for guidance next year. I think we're pleased with the gross margin up slightly versus next year when you think about absorbing the impact of tariffs, as well as currency headwinds. We are assuming that we have increased our leverage and our operating income line which is going to drive the EPS growth on the bottom. And I think the tax rate I think you said is increasing but it's actually flat 23% year-over-year. And I think from a cash flow perspective, as we've stated before, we're really focused on deploying that free cash flow. Priority would be tuck-in M&A followed by opportunistic share repurchase just like we've done recently here with Focal Faxitron in the 2.3 million shares repurchased in Q4. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Good job. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Steve, I was wondering about if you could just elaborate a little on your conversations with the FDA and what exactly you're looking at in terms of putting together a clinical trial on the women's health side. Do you think it's possible you could be back in the market with either MonaLisa or Vitalia this year? Is this going to be more of a 2020 event? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: I think the simple way to think about it is obviously MonaLisa is on the market but I think the whole market is kind of retrenched at this point in time. And I think the smart thing to assume at this point in time is Vitalia will not be back during the fiscal year. If it came back sooner, then it'd be a wonderful upside to us. But I think as we look at the work that needs to be done, it's probably an out-year event. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, it would be great to hear your expectations on Fusion as we enter the upcoming respiratory season. On how much within the mid-single-digit or so Molecular growth do you think that's contributing there? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Fusion, as we've been saying all along, is really a multiyear build that's very small this year. So we've got the respiratory assays on it just beginning that. But as we've always said, Fusion is a gateway that over time it allows us to go much further into PCR assays and everything else. I think frankly based on a supplier or whatever and their own issues, I think it might have been taken out of context. But we're very pleased with the initial uptake, but I've always said this one's going to build over many, many years. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: And, Jack, it's Mike. One piece of that is obviously is adding menu to the platform over time. And we started with the three respiratory assays, as Steve was alluding to, which is a good start. Just got our Group B Streptococcus, which is a women's health assay approved this quarter, and just in recent days got clearances for some of the software that take the open channel capabilities up a notch. So, doing a good job of building out that menu, but as Steve said, it's going to take a little bit of time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Doug. Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon. This is actually Chris on for Doug today. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to start with another question on Diagnostics. Just curious if you could provide some commentary on how broader Diagnostics pricing is trending? And how are you embedding the impact to pricing and revenue guidance? I guess said differently, what could Molecular grow this year if pricing remains stable? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. We're seeing just modest declines. Obviously, the PAMA pressures and everything else, but I'd say marginally negative but not a whole sales step change down. I think frankly based on a lot of us being able to sell our workflow advantages with Panther, everything else, being able to try to fight off steeper price cuts. Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then for my follow-up question, could you just provide an update on how efforts to reallocate resources in Medical Aesthetics is progressing? And then are you assuming any material new product launches this year to hit your Medical Aesthetics revenue guidance? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. I think we feel good about the rebuild of the sales force there, obviously with TempSure Vitalia off the market, going back and selling a little bit more out of the rest of the product line. We did \u2013 as we look into this year, TempSure is just getting a surgical indication, so that'll provide a little bit of news as well for us through the year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Want to circle back to a couple of questions that were asked or alluded to earlier. So I guess first is given that we're entering or getting close to entering year two of PAMA, Steve, would anticipate any incremental pressure on the Molecular business? And obviously the same goes for the third year of that obviously a year away. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's embedded in our growth rates. And I think we feel pretty good about -- we've got additional volume. We have new products coming, and it's just another pressure we absorb like any other business going forward. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah, the other piece of that, Bill, as you know as well as anybody is in an environment that could be consolidating, I mean, we're pretty well-positioned with Panther and a menu now that has \u2013 geez, off top of my head \u2013 well over a dozen assays. So it plays into the need for the customer to drive efficiency and improve the workflow. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Understood. Thanks. And then also just wanted to, I guess, get some additional color on the Interventional side of the business, Steve, clearly one of the bright spots here this year. Just talk to us about the sustainability of the growth platform with that business. Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. I think this has always been part of Pete Valenti, the Head of our Breast Health business, as he thought about adjacent areas to really expand into and put a lot of energy from the day he walked in the door. If you think about it, we launched the Affirm prone biopsy system a couple of years ago, Brevera, and now Faxitron and Focal will also start to fit into that. So it's really been much more of that portfolio shift from just gantries to extending across the continuum. And really like where that business is going. Is it organically a double-digit grower? Probably not. But are we going to be able to generate very strong growth? We've had four double-digit quarters in a row. It's becoming a very meaningful contributor to the business. And with Faxitron and Focal also coming into that, it should continue to be a very strong grower here for some time. Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. And I would just add, Steve, that on Brevera, demand is outpacing supply. So as we get supply in line, we should see some acceleration from Brevera. So we feel really good about that as well. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Just a few clarifying questions here first and then maybe a follow-up. I guess, for Karleen and Steve, just to follow up here, number one, just thinking about the organic growth for fiscal 2019. Our math has 2.5% to 3.5% organic growth as the implied range. Karleen, is that close to your math? Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.: No, we're closer to 3% to 4% organic growth. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: But when you deal with currency and Blood Screening going down, David, it probably comes out to be a little bit better. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And your assumption, Karleen, in that number is, I'm assuming, $45 million to $50 million of M&A contribution in 2019? Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. So what we're thinking about in the organic growth is that the incremental growth for Faxitron and Focal is part of ours because we believe that like we've seen with our distributors that we've purchased internationally, that those businesses will actually perform better as part of Hologic versus stand-alone. So that could be the difference of how we're thinking about it. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. And don't forget Faxitron, one quarter is organic, next year as well. Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.: Right, right. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: It could be part of it. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Some consideration for the future will be just to give a direct organic growth number. I think investors \u2013 sort of non-standard, I think investors would appreciate it, just food for thought. And Steve, just following up, the SculpSure number, the on-body number, I'm just trying to understand, sequentially that number is down on an absolute basis. Even if the comps are more challenging, the business is still down $6 million sequentially. How can that business be down sequentially on an absolute basis and the underlying trends in the business be getting better? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Seasonality. Don't forget seasonality is a big deal. That quarter is always down significantly sequentially because of the summer months. Operator : We'll take our next question from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Jaime L. Morgan - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Jaime on for Rich. A quick question that I had, I guess, you guys had announced a agreement with Porter Instruments (sic) [Porter Instrument] within your Medical Aesthetics business. Just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the strategy there and how it might influence your revenue projections for the Medical Aesthetics business in 2019? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure, Jaime. It's really an ancillary product that we're distributing that helps reduce the pain for the patients. So it's a \u2013 basically, it's a nitrogen oxide product that patients can take. In the grand scheme, relatively small revenue, but complementary to the procedure and enhances the patient experience for a lot of the other products and procedures that we sell. But it should be starting to be somewhat meaningful as we go forward. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. And strategically, I think it illustrates what we can do as we can build out our sales force, right? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: We'll have one of the larger and more well-equipped sales forces in the industry. So the ability to bring our own organic innovations is one piece and then hopefully, look for some in-license type opportunities as well. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. Jaime L. Morgan - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then on the Surgical business, I don't know if I maybe missed it, but did you guys give an actual range for what you're expecting that business to grow in 2019? And if so, can you talk a little bit about the cadence? I know it's shown sequential improvement here in fiscal 2018. So is it fair to assume that that can continue to accelerate in 2019? Thanks. Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. What we said is we expect low- to mid-single-digit growth for that division and it's really a couple of elements there. We expect on NovaSure to have lower declines versus 2018. But we do expect to have MyoSure continue to grow in the high single-digit, maybe low double-digit range, as well as contribution from our new Fluent product that was recently launched. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.: One thing to keep in mind on the pacing of that, I mean, there is a little bit of seasonality in Surgical. Our December quarter, which is our Q1, tends to be a little bit stronger and then the Q2 tends to sequentially get a little less and then it builds over the course of the years. So just keep that in mind as you're modeling. Operator : We'll take our next question from Daniel Brennan with UBS. Daniel Gregory Brennan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. I was just hoping to get a \u2013 first question would be just on the virology opportunity. Maybe you can provide some color what the traction's been so far, U.S. versus OUS, and what's kind of assumed in fiscal 2019 for virology? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. You know what? We've been very pleased with the virology uptake. We've always described this as a \u2013 I always think about it as a thin slice of pie that each quarter, when we look at our graphs, each quarter is selling more both domestically and internationally. But it's a multiyear build. And as we've continued to say, even in the U.S., a lot of major contracts were locked up for a while, so we're building it nicely over time. And I think it'll be bigger in 2019 than it was in 2018, be bigger in 2020 than it will be in 2019, and probably bigger in 2021 than in 2020. So just kind of keeps building steadily, frankly, in a very nice pace. Daniel Gregory Brennan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Steve. And then maybe on the OUS opportunity, obviously, it's been a big driver. I think you provided guidance for high single-digit, given that you've now comped out those two acquisitions of the distributors. But maybe provide some color regarding the underlying drivers from here. What are some of the biggest opportunities OUS that still might be untapped or ahead of you? Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. It's almost franchise-by-franchise. I think we've got a much stronger presence for Breast Health now, certainly with now having direct operations in Germany, Spain, as well as the UK, feeling really good about our European business and just the underlying capabilities to drive both the gantries, but also starting to get into the Interventional space, products like Brevera and those things as well over time. Diagnostics, we've been making great progress. As we mentioned, almost 40% of our Panthers are now outside the United States. So we've been getting good traction with our women's health assays, also obviously the virals as well outside the U.S. And our Surgical business, while still small internationally, has been showing really nice growth as well. So I think we see opportunities there, and frankly Medical Aesthetics will be as well outside. It sounds like we have time for two more questions. Operator : I think we have time for two more questions. We'll take our next question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks for fitting me in. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Hey, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Karleen, a couple of \u2013 hi \u2013 a couple of clarifications. I may have missed it, but did you give a specific revenue guide up down for Medical Aesthetics for the year? Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.: Yeah. I think for the year we expect Medical Aesthetics to grow kind of in the low- to mid-single-digits. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.: And really we do expect that women's health is going to be a headwind for that business next year. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And guidance for net interest expense? Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.: So I think we just said it's going to be up over the current year \u2013 maybe up about $50 million. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : On a broader one \u2013 got you. And then just a bigger question, Steve, in the Breast Health market, obviously your biggest competitor in that market is a tad distracted at the moment. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape? What's going on? I guess how much of your market opportunity of that -- of competitor installed base do you think is up for grabs? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: We like to think it's all up for grabs. I would say pragmatically the sales reps aren't nearly as distracted as corporate management is. So at the field, we don't always feel those things quite as much as the rest of us might. Having said that I think we just continue to innovate. We are one or two generations ahead of certainly that competitor. And they still haven't matched frankly what we've been selling a couple of years ago. So I think we just continue to innovate and feel very good about our progress at the Street level. And it's why I think we're gaining market share every single year right now and expect to continue to do so. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question. We'll take our final question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Andrew Brackmann - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. This is actually Andrew Brackmann on for Brian. Two questions on Panther. I'll just ask them upfront. I think you said the utilization last year grew low-double digits. Could you maybe talk about what's implied in your guidance for this year? And then maybe could you talk a little bit more about the competitive landscape there? Are you seeing anything different? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.: Sure. I think we assume frankly for additional Panthers, we'll continue to place more Panthers and we'll continue to get a little more usage from each Panther that's out there. The competitive landscape, I don't think it's dramatically different. Obviously as we become a bigger player, particularly on a global stage, not just in the U.S., we're running into other strong competitors around the world. But I wouldn't say we're seeing anything materially different. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. This is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologistics (sic) [Hologic's] fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. Have a good afternoon.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic, Inc. First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Allen. I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Watts : Thank you, Allen. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Hologic's first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company\u2019s Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through February 22nd. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Steve MacMillan : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. It was a very strong quarter overall, as total revenue of $830.7 million and earnings per share of $0.58 both finished ahead of our guidance ranges. As we preannounced before the JPMorgan conference, our first quarter performance was again led by our largest core businesses : U.S. Breast Health, International and Global Molecular Diagnostics, all of which posted double-digit constant currency growth to start our fiscal year. These strong revenue results continued the positive momentum that started to build in the second half of 2018 after we reorganized our leadership team earlier in the year. They represent progress in our efforts to accelerate growth by focusing on our core strengths, especially in Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics, and the efforts we began several years ago to dramatically transform the productivity and output of our R&D teams to create a much more robust stream of new products. In Breast Health, we are building on our large installed base of market-leading, clinically differentiated Genius 3D Mammography systems. Specifically, we have launched new mammography systems that help us segment the market better, developed new products that enable us to play a greater role in the patient's Breast Health journey, grown our service revenue and acquired two small companies to enter the adjacent growth market of breast-conserving surgery. Together, these strategies have broken the boom-and-bust cycles of the past and should result in more consistent, predictable Breast Health growth going forward. In Molecular Diagnostics, we continue to fuel an attractive Razor/Razorblade business model that is enabled by our large and growing installed base of fully automated Panther systems and the broadest assay menu in the mid to high-volume molecular space. We now have more than 15 tests that have been FDA cleared or CE marked to run on the Panther or Panther Fusion platforms. Two-thirds of which have been introduced just since the start of calendar 2017. And these new assays combined with our unique ability to partner with customers to drive demand and establish categories, such as sexual and reproductive health, have led to strong consistent growth in system utilization as well as sales. We are also making great progress in extending our Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics strengths to international markets where the opportunities are large, but our shares are low compared to the United States. Over the last few years, we have very deliberately and carefully built the foundations for reliable and consistent international growth. As a result, OUS revenue excluding blood and aesthetics grew at a low double-digit rate in both 2017 and 2018. And we are off to a good start in 2019 with 14.9% growth in the first quarter. With that introduction, let's discuss our first quarter results in more detail now. Revenue of $830.7 million grew 5.0% on a reported basis or 5.7% in constant currency, well ahead of our expectations. The acquired Faxitron and Focal businesses performed well contributing $12.2 million to revenue. If you back out this contribution as well as revenue from our divested Blood Screening business you can see that growth would have been about 4.1%, still a significant improvement compared to recent quarters. In terms of geography, our domestic businesses accelerated in the first quarter, posting growth of 4.1% led by Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics. And as I mentioned earlier, our legacy international franchises also performed well recording our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth excluding Blood Screening and Cynosure. Molecular had another exceptional quarter internationally and our Breast Health and Surgical businesses grew at double-digit rates as well, reflecting the broad-based improvements we have made in recent years. Including international sales of Cynosure products, which declined in the period, total international sales were $208.9 million still a robust increase of 10.7%. Now, let me provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. Let's start with our biggest business, Breast Health, which has reestablished itself as an important growth driver for the company and generated much of the upside in our results recently. Global Breast Health sales totaled $324.7 million in what is typically a seasonally soft quarter, a robust increase of 13.4%. Even excluding $7.7 million of Faxitron revenue in breast imaging and $4.5 million from Focal in Interventional Breast, the division grew 9.1% globally. We are especially pleased that in the U.S. which represented more than three-quarters of global sales in the quarter, sales increased by almost 8% excluding Faxitron and Focal, the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year growth. As we discussed at JPMorgan, while some have been overly focused on our Aesthetics division, which represents only about 10% of sales, we have quietly but strategically transformed Breast Health from a domestic capital franchise into a steady diversified global growth business across the continuum of breast healthcare. There have been several aspects to this strategic transformation. First, we have prioritized international expansion which was evident again this quarter with Breast Health sales growth in the mid-teens. Second, we have strengthened our service business, a nice source of recurring revenue that is larger than gantry sales and grew steadily in the first quarter. Third, we have used our strong cash flows to complete two tuck-in acquisitions over the last six months, to establish a foothold in the adjacent growth market of breast conserving surgery. Faxitron and Focal performed well this quarter, posting revenue that was in line to slightly better than our internal expectations. Fourth, we have increased the productivity of our R&D engine. New product sales contributed significantly to Breast Health growth this quarter, led by our new clinically differentiated 3Dimensions and 3D performance mammography systems. These new products, which have helped us gain market share through better customer segmentation, drove 15% growth in breast imaging revenue this quarter, and together represented the majority of 3D systems sold. These new gantries are helping us to continue to convert customers from traditional 2D mammography to 3D, which provides better clinical results. But at the same time, we have now begun to farm our existing installed base of 3D systems for upgrades, such as our new Intelligent 2D, Clarity HD and SmartCurve products. These new upgrades contributed about 200 basis points to global Breast Health growth in our first quarter. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Breast Health team for building a diversified sustainable growth business. We have more work to do, of course, but our Breast Health division has never been stronger than it is today, based on a clinically differentiated core of mammography systems, multiple new products built around this core and two complementary tuck-in acquisitions. Before we move on, let me mention this, since we're starting a new fiscal year we've simplified our external reporting a little. Specifically, in Breast Health, we've eliminated the small other revenue line in our press release and added these sales to imaging. These sales were only about $2.7 million in the first quarter compared to $2.3 million in the prior year period, so the numbers are too small to matter. Now let's turn to diagnostics where revenue of $296.6 million increased 5.0%, which we're very pleased with. Molecular remains the growth driver in this division. As we said at JPMorgan, we have transformed this business as well from a niche player in sexually transmitted disease testing to a broad-based molecular diagnostics leader with strong customer partnerships. In the first quarter, Molecular sales of $164.3 million grew 11.2%, accelerating for the third consecutive quarter, if you exclude non-recurring royalty revenue that benefited the fourth quarter of 2018. Internationally, Molecular grew well into the double-digits for the 10th time in 11 quarters. And in the U.S., although we already enjoy high market shares in key assay categories molecular still grew at a high single-digit rate. This was better than in recent periods and reflects how we work collaboratively with our customers to drive testing volumes and better patient care. As evidence of this, we announced last quarter that we were finalizing multi-year contract extensions with our two largest customers and both of these are now complete. Molecular growth was broad based in the quarter as we leveraged our fully automated Panther system. We continue to place more Panthers and drive increased utilization by encouraging customers to consolidate testing on the system. In the first quarter specifically, revenue growth was driven by strong sales of our new quantitative viral load tests as well as legacy women's health assays for HPV Trichomonas and Chlamydia Gonorrhea. And we have many more assays and capabilities in development for markets around the world. For example, just last week, we again demonstrated our leadership in the infectious disease space by announcing a first-of-its-kind FDA clearance for an innovative new assay to detect a sexually transmitted bacteria called M Genitalium. Moving on, cytology and perinatal sales of $118.1 million declined 3.2% in the first quarter. It's worth mentioning that cytology sales were basically flat while perinatal sales declined significantly due to a shift in ordering patterns. In the United States, growth in the cytology market remains challenged due to our high market shares and longer cervical cancer testing intervals. However, ThinPrep remains a core strength for us given the key role it plays in women's health and the ability to run several of our molecular assays out of its collection vial. Elsewhere in diagnostics, revenue related to our divested blood screening business was higher than expected at $14.2 million, a little more than last year. As a reminder, this revenue mainly reflects low-margin products and services under transition agreements we have with Grifols. Now let's shift gears and cover GYN Surgical, where sales of $108.4 million grew 1.4%. Surgical trends were consistent with recent quarters. MyoSure, which now represents a little more than half of Surgical revenue, grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, while NovaSure sales declined at a mid-single-digit rate. We believe Surgical growth rates will improve over the course of 2019 based on improving sales execution in the United States and increasing contributions from new products such as our Fluent fluid management system and Omni hysteroscope. Now, let's turn to Medical Aesthetics where sales of $79.8 million represented less than 10% of consolidated revenue and declined 11.6% a disappointing result. This decline resulted from two primary factors; first, increased competition in the non-evasive fat reduction category negatively affected sales of SculpSure lasers as well as consumable PAC keys. As a result, revenue in our body subcategory declined by more than 40%. Second, the women's health market has not recovered following the FDA's cautionary letters on certain procedures. As a result, sales of women's health and other products declined more than 20%. In contrast, sales of our skin-related products performed well in the quarter increasing about 10%. So, what we have now at Cynosure is a salesforce that continues to come up to speed with some pockets of good performance in an aesthetics market that still exhibits attractive growth overall. It's also clear that we have more work ahead to generate the constant commercial buzz that this market demands. We are developing new marketing approaches toward this end and also seeking out new products that can attract customer attention in the context of rapid product cycles. These include internally developed systems such as our TempSure Surgical capability as well as in-licensed products. To round out the revenue discussion briefly skeletal sales of $21.2 million grew 8.5% against a very weak prior year comparable especially outside the United States. Given the small revenue base here relatively small changes in comps or ordering patterns can cause large swings in percentage growth rates. So, to wrap-up, we posted very good financial results in the first quarter, driven by strength in our largest businesses; Breast Health, International, and Global Molecular Diagnostics. We are working to further accelerate growth by leveraging our core strengths especially in Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics. We are off to a good start in 2019 and as a result we are increasing our guidance for the year. Karleen will discuss that guidance in a moment. So, now let me turn the call over to her. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to walk through the rest of our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, then finish up with our updated financial guidance for 2019 as well as the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Steve described, we are pleased with our first quarter results as revenue and EPS exceeded our guidance based on strong performances from U.S. Breast Health International and Global Molecular Diagnostics. We also strategically deployed capital in accordance with our stated priorities. We closed on the acquisition of Focal Therapeutics, a nice tuck-in opportunity, to strengthen our position in breast-conserving surgery and capitalized on our share repurchase authorization. Our fiscal year is off to a good start and we are raising our financial guidance accordingly, despite an incremental foreign exchange headwind. With that introduction, let me start by reviewing our P&L for the first quarter. Gross margins of 62.2% decreased 160 basis points compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to product and geographic sales mix, as our international sales carry a lower gross margin percentage than sales in the United States. Gross margin was also negatively affected by a stronger U.S. dollar, trade tariffs in China and disappointing domestic Medical Aesthetics sales. And don't forget, as Steve mentioned, the upside in revenue related to our divested blood screening business comes with little growth margin. Total operating expenses of $274.7 million increased 1.1% in the first quarter. This increase was mainly driven by the impact of the Faxitron and Focal acquisitions, which contributed roughly $6 million of expense. Excluding Faxitron and Focal, operating expenses actually declined 1.2%, reflecting our ability to drive operating leverage while still funding investments for future growth. Operating margins of 29.2% declined 20 basis points in the first quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to the effect of product and geographic mix on gross margins. Overall, our operating profitability remains very healthy and we continue to see opportunities to improve further. Finally, net margins of 18.9% decreased 50 basis points compared with the prior year period. All of this led to non-GAAP net income of $156.7 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58, exceeding our guidance range. Before we cover our revised 2019 guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Our finance teams had a very effective start to the new fiscal year. In addition to closing the Focal acquisition, we strengthened our balance sheet by restructuring our debt and acting opportunistically on our outstanding share repurchase authorization. Specifically in the first quarter, we amended our credit agreement, which includes a five-year $1.5 billion senior term loan and a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. We used these proceeds from new facility to refinance at a slightly lower interest rate, our previously outstanding senior term loan and revolver. Based on our strong financial position, we were also able to extend our debt maturities, gaining increased financial flexibility. At the same time, we repurchased 3.7 million shares of our stock for about $150 million in the first quarter, helping reduce our shares outstanding. And we have more than $260 million remaining on our buyback authorization. Even with all this productive capital deployment at the end of the first quarter, our leverage ratio net debt-over-EBITDA stood at only 2.8 times. We remain comfortable around this level recognizing that the ratio could fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and buyback activity. Moving on, adjusted EBITDA of $260.7 million increased slightly compared to the prior year. Finally, the company generated $82 million of free cash flow in the first quarter. Excluding a non-recurring litigation settlement with Smith & Nephew, free cash flows would have been $116.8 million. We continue to generate industry-leading free cash which enables us to pursue tuck-in acquisitions such as Faxitron and Focal while also acting on our share repurchase authorization as we see opportunities in the market. Now I'd like to shift gears and discuss our non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and second quarter. We are updating our full year guidance based on our good first quarter results, partially offset by the stronger U.S. dollar which is affecting all multinational companies. At a high level, we are increasing our constant currency revenue guidance and slightly raising our EPS forecast. Let's start with revenue. As a reminder, we've previously guided to reported sales of $3.29 billion to $3.335 billion, which represented constant currency growth of between 2.8% and 4.2%. Based on our strong first quarter results we are increasing our revenue guidance to $3.305 billion to $3.335 billion which includes between $40 million or $45 million of revenue from our divested blood screening business. Based on recent exchange rates, our new revenue guidance translates to constant currency growth of 3.8% to 4.7% better than our initial 2019 guidance. As you know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened materially since we first guided. In fact, based on recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency fluctuations are driving an incremental headwind of roughly $15 million to our previous revenue guidance. Despite this headwind, we feel confident about the growth in our core businesses and our ability to control expenses. As a result, we are increasing our EPS guidance slightly to a range of $2.39 to $2.43 which represents reported growth of between 7.2% and 9.0%. I should point out that EPS growth would be higher, if not for the increasing currency headwinds and diminished contributions from our divested blood screening business. This updated full year guidance is based on diluted shares outstanding of approximately 272 million for the full year which reflects progress on our buyback program and effective tax rate of approximately 23% which is the same as our original guidance. Now let's turn to guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect revenue of between $795 million and $810 million which reflects growth of 2.5% to 4.4% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, our guidance reflects revenue growth of 0.7% to 2.6%. As a reminder, our second quarter of 2019 has one fewer selling day than the prior year period although we don't expect this to have a significant impact. In addition, it's worth explaining that we expect quarterly revenue to decline sequentially versus the $830.7 million, we posted in the first quarter for two reasons. First, we forecast less revenue from our divested blood screening business; and second as a reminder the March quarter is seasonally weaker than the December quarter for our Surgical, Medical Aesthetics and Diagnostics businesses. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.55 to $0.57 in the second quarter which implies growth rates of between 3.8% and 7.5% continuing to outpace revenue growth. As you update your forecasts, we would encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance range as we still \u2013 as it's still early in the year and we've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that we are pleased with how we started 2019 with our Breast Health, Global Molecular Diagnostics and International businesses driving robust growth. We continue to generate industry-leading cash flows and put that cash to good use with a focus on tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases. Based on all of this, we are raising our financial guidance despite incremental currency headwinds. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll first go to Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian Weinstein : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I thought we could just start with a little bit on gross margins here. Obviously post blood screening the sale we've seen gross margins kind of trend a little bit lower here. I understand the commentary about OUS having a lower margin. But can you break out for us kind of the margin by geography and just give us an idea about how you're thinking about gross margin longer term here as that mix continues to shift? Kind of something in the low 62s, is this the way that we should be thinking about the business longer term? Or is there an opportunity to maybe drive that to something back towards the mid-60s over time? Karleen Oberton : Hey, Brian, it's Karleen. Let me give that a shot. So yes, so in the quarter margins came in a little over 62%, which was a little bit below that plan. And one of the pieces of that was the FX headwinds, which is about 50 basis point hit to the margins on the quarter. I would also say that in the quarter the shortfall in the domestic Medical Aesthetics sales contributed to that. But as we think about gross margins longer term, yeah, we're trying to think that they would trend up from where they are now. I think there's a couple of things that we think about would drive that. We continually evaluate opportunities for efficiencies both on supply chain and our manufacturing network as we pursue some of the tuck-in M&A strategies. We like to look for those products that would have accretive gross margins. As an example, Focal of the BioZorb product is very accretive to our overall consolidated gross margins. And then international while there is a disconnect in the margins between the U.S., we think there is opportunity as that business grows to create more leverage there. Steve MacMillan : Brian? Sound like Brian froze in the Chicago cold. Operator : Mr. Weinstein your line is still open. Brian Weinstein : Hi, can you guys hear me? Can you hear me still? Steve MacMillan : Yes, there you go. Brian Weinstein : Yes. So, just on new products, you guys have talked a lot about it. Can you give us some idea about the contribution to total revenue? What percentage of revenue new products represent? And then also can you highlight some of the key items in the pipeline that we should be looking forward going throughout the year? And then Steve just want to make sure you have a lifejacket because I hear it's supposed to be in the 60s when you leave tonight. So, just want to make sure you're warm enough. Steve MacMillan : Thank you, Brian. So -- go ahead Mike. Mike Watts : Yes, hey Brian on new -- it's Mike. On new products, I don't have a specific number in front of me. We did say at the JPMorgan Conference that that total more than tripled in 2018 versus 2017. Certainly Q1 continued those trends. I would say some of the bigger products would obviously be 3Dimensions and 3D Performance in our Breast Health business. We've been very successful with the Affirm prone table and Brevera. In the Diagnostics business, we're seeing really good uptake from the viral load assays as well. So, those are probably the main ones. Brian Weinstein : All right. Operator : All right. And next we'll go to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Bill Quirk : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. And I can fasten on Tyler's share with Brian is complaining about, it's pretty balmy where I'm sitting. Steve MacMillan : What it is out there, Bill? It's like 20 below? Bill Quirk : Might be negative 35 at the windshield, but who is complaining. Steve if we -- Steve or Karleen, if we back out the Faxitron deal, looks like Interventional was fairly flat. I was hoping you could add some additional color about that particular business line and how we should be thinking about that trend over the balance of the year. Karleen Oberton : Yes sure. It's Karleen. So main reason for that trend is Brevera. I think we've talked about some of the supply constraints that we have on the disposals related to that capital equipment. So, we've intentionally held back sales on the capital side because what we don't want is to sell the capital to customers and then not be able to supply the needle that goes with it for the procedures. So, don't want to have frustrated customers in the field. As we think about that, we do believe that supply should improve as the year goes on and then we should see improving trends for that subdivision. Bill Quirk : Perfect. Thanks Karleen. And then secondly guys wanted to ask a little bit about the Mycoplasma genitalium assay that was just approved. I mean it seems like a pretty natural extension of the reproductive health diagnostics offering that you have. Can you help us think about market size and how we should think about this filtering into the Diagnostics business? I recognize that it's probably not as large of a market as say HPV or Chlamydia, gonorrhea. But just help us give a few items to think about to frame it up. Steve MacMillan : Sure Bill. And this has been a really great one for our team because believe it or not we started looking at this back in the early 2000s when we started to realize that just the existing assays didn't seem to capture everything in terms of cervicitis and some of the other things. And our team has been quietly working on this one for quite some time. And I think it's going to be probably a lot more like our Trich assays. These kind of things that, any given quarter here you're not going to see a huge amount it's going to be getting off. But we've already been in talk with some of the payers. We think it will emerge to be a very significant assay, call it, in the three to five-year horizon. But certainly over the beginning times, here like most of our assays, very small out of the gates as we build the support and the awareness. But it's another one of these where we do think our TMA technology puts us in a unique position to have more sensitive and specific assay in this space. So limited expectations for this year, but it's going to one that is again in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 we'll look back and say, this has turned out to be a really nice addition to our portfolio. Operator : All right. We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Thanks. So maybe, Steve, just on breast imaging. I'm getting to organic overall breast because of high singles here. And this is all coming from imaging. I mean, some of the comments you're making on new product traction, upgrade cycle. Why shouldn't these trends be sustainable in the back half, right? Because certainly it looks like there is something going on in the CapEx market. Stryker this morning spoke about beds and stretchers being up. Maybe just can you comment on CapEx environment and why these trends are not sustainable? Steve MacMillan : Sure, Vijay. I think, let's say, it was a really nice quarter. We also had a softer comp. Yeah. I think the comps get stronger as the year goes on. The other piece, just if you look at the global economic environment right now, we want to be careful. It was a great quarter, an awesome quarter. We want to be careful not to get too far out of our ski tips here, not knowing where things are going. But I will tell you, we feel really, really good about the underlying trends. We're hearing good things from our customers and we'll see where we go. But we're just one quarter into the year. Vijay Kumar : Helpful, Steve. And I had one follow-up. I mean, just curious I think we had RSNA in December and I would have thought that's going to be weak, but you guys crushed it. Maybe Karleen, on the EPS guidance, it looks like revenues, bottom up came up a little bit, right? We had some FX offsetting, maybe better M&A and the Q1 strength. But did I hear you correctly? I mean, share count went down on the guidance for $4 million. And that's about 140 bps contribution, but your EPS was just tweaked up by $0.01. Is there something below the line that we should be thinking of? Or is this a margin question? Thank you. Karleen Oberton : No, no. I don't think there's anything below the line. I think FX is incremental headwind on the bottom line as well, that we factored in here. So I think it's just early, early out of the gate here and don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Operator : All right. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Steve MacMillan : Hey, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : Hi. Apologies. I'm going to have to ask about Cyno though, and I appreciate it's down 10% of revenues. But we did see some pretty tough results out of your peer the other day from Allergan. Just curious, is there something in the market that's kind of causing this shift? And it sounds like for some of their commentary there, just kind of equipment, a little heavier. So can you maybe just talk to pricing? And then secondly, Vitalia, now that it's reintroduced, can you just talk on conversations with the FDA around generating data and how you think about kind of backing that up? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Sure. Tycho, on the first part, within the body contouring category, we've been relatively constant on holding our pricing. It was a tougher quarter. I think what we've clearly learned and it's going to affect our R&D and licensing strategies here as we go forward is in any given quarter often times the docs had a little bit of amount of money that they're going to spend for new equipment. And if you got kind of the shiny new toy you may go that way. And there's been a product or two from some of the private companies that have done pretty well in the short term. You get a little bit hot in the quarter and that clearly affects things. I think as it relates to Vitalia going forward, we've been back in discussions obviously the last five weeks. There wasn't a lot of discussion going on with the FDA. But we feel like we have a pathway forward. It's going to be a couple of years, pragmatically before we really have the data on both that and MonaLisa to strengthen the data and claims. So that's where we're just imagining expectations in that women's health piece of the business for the next number of quarters. But still very bullish about the longer-term outlook. But it's clearly kicked it out a couple of years past what we had hoped and expected. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then on diagnostics, there is some news out today that the FDA is going to have an evaluation panel on looking at devices for HPV detection. I know it's kind of professional just curious, if you have any thoughts there. And then can you also clarify on perinatal what the shift in ordering pattern was about? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Sure. Good job getting two follow-ups into one. So, thanks Tycho. The FDA panel, we're encouraged by this. And obviously as the leader in both HPV as well as PAC and co-testing and everything else, we've been having great dialogue both with FDA as well as the National Cancer Institute and see that there will be continued evolutions. What we're seeing around the world right now is a real mixed bag all over the place different countries having different approaches, whether it's co-testing in submarkets, clearly adopting mRNA our technology in a lot of markets. And there's a lot of different approaches happening around the world right now and I think the FDA wants to kind of take a peek at both that as well as the U.S. We've been in those discussions and feel pretty good about what we're working on for the longer term in this category as well. So, we will see where it goes. Did you want to add something, Karleen? Karleen Oberton : Yes, I was just going to answer the question with regards to perinatal and the ordering pats. So this Tycho' goes back to the recall that we had. So what happened is we had products become available again in Q1 of 2018. We had an acceleration of restocking of the product as well. We had a reversal of the reserve that we had taken in the previous period. Operator : We'll take our next question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : Good afternoon guys. Thank you. So just on guidance question if I could. I'm just trying to deconstruct the impact of -- if I think about FX being a little bit worse debt refi helpful and then obviously the operational changes getting better. If you could try and maybe take each of those piecemeal I'm trying to figure out how those all kind of netted together? Karleen Oberton : So, yes, I think from a top line perspective, are you talking the top line and the bottom line, Isaac? Isaac Ro : EPS. I mean, obviously the EPS update was not significant on a net basis. But I felt like there are a few moving parts that's why I wanted to try and deconstruct it. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So, I would say that on the FX piece that was probably a couple of pennies that drops to the bottom line kind of a headwind that we didn't have from the original guidance. Isaac Ro : Okay. And then debt refi? Steve MacMillan : That\u2019s pretty meaningful. $15 million of incremental FX and drops to gross at least what happened. Karleen Oberton : Yeah. It's probably $0.02 to $0.03. Mike Watts : Yeah. The other stuff below the line, Isaac was about the same really not much change in other income expense. It's mainly that FX piece. Isaac Ro : Okay, got it. And then maybe separate topic. On the Breast Health business, I think the question was asked earlier about what was going on with the imaging side. I'd be interested if you could maybe identify the growth contribution you got from better capture of aftermarket revenue the nonmammography-related products. You gave a little bit of detail there, but just looking to get more? Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Sure, Isaac. I think the biggest piece is we've been fragmenting the market. Everybody's been looking for what was going to be the next big whether it's 2D, 3D, or \u201c4D\u201d. And what we've been saying all along is we're turning this into understanding the market, bringing new innovations. We brought 3Dimensions at the higher end. We brought 3D Performance at the lower end. And we've, obviously, still got a firm prone, the biopsy system. We've got all of these products. And then increasingly we did reference about 200 bps of growth of now really starting to sell upgrades in terms of the Clarity HD, the SmartCurve panel things to already our 3D base that are out there. And I think that's the exciting part now that we have both continued innovations on the core mammography 3D systems, but also starting to mine the base that's already out there. We've watched the SmartCurve panel and again we've got over what 5,000 6,000 \u2013 well over 5,000 about 6,000 installed base out there. And we have more business coming through. We've also got the service revenue coming through as well. So it's that shift from just a boom bust launch one new product once a decade and ride it up and then ride it down to a steady stream of innovation, customer segmentation understanding, which customers want which, and the ability to go mine even the existing 3D bases to start to bring more upgrades along the way. Operator : All right. Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. Richard Newitter : Thank you. Steve, if I could just \u2013 how are you doing? If I could just follow-up on the breast imaging. So I appreciate what you're saying. I think it's great that there's a bit more stability and predictability and that the R&D strategy is paying off. But I'm also just wondering, is there a to use your words 4D-like product that's cooking? And if so when might we be thinking about that product cycle? Is that three years away? Two years away? And then I have a follow-up. Steve MacMillan : Sure. You can imagine we've got lots of great additional things in our pipeline. We've always -- we've been the innovator in this space, certainly over the last decade. We continue to innovate on both claims and products and it's a huge reason why we are by far the leader in the 3D space and in the mammography space in the U. S. and why we have significantly gained the market share over the last five years. So, having said that, we've still got a bunch of our existing 2D base to convert to 3D, and what we've been trying to tell you along is, there'll be more innovations. It may not be quiet the impact in the future because of the fragmenting customer base and just because of the way we have filled up the customers and going back and mining the existing base instead of waiting until the next big thing coming. And our goal that we've said all along been in the company now for 20, 21 quarters, we said, we wanted to build a very sustainable growth business in Breast Health. That's exactly where we've been. So we're far more focused on doing that and believe that our innovation engine is much more geared for that going forward than for just a big one-hit wonder. But we do have some very cool things still in the pipeline. Richard Newitter : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just going back to the Aesthetics business for a moment. You mentioned several times kind of a shift in thinking to kind a keep up with the shiny object kind of nature of this business. You're going to collaborate more through business transactions or relationships, I guess. Can you just give a little more color around how that would work? What kind of structures these relationships would take? And are you open to a further tuck-in M&A in that segment as it presents itself? Or this is the direction going forward that you'll take in the Aesthetics segment? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Yes. I think the fascinating part is given the lifecycles of some of the products in the aesthetics space, we think there's a lot more opportunities frankly to have a balanced approach of both organic and inorganic innovation. And the inorganic to a large degree doesn't even have to be acquisition as much as it can be in-license, like we did with Nitronox. And we're in discussions with a lot of other companies. And when we've certainly seen some of the private competitors in this space, it's not necessarily needing to acquire. You can actually license, write it for a few years and the lifecycles are clearly different than rest of our businesses. So in some cases frankly licensing is a better way to go probably than acquisition. Operator : Next we'll go to Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Steve MacMillan : Hi, Dan. Dan Leonard : Thank you. Hi, Steve. So, two questions on breast imaging. First, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on what you're talking about regarding farming the installed base of 3D for upgrades. What is the runway there? And how durable should we think about the 200 basis points of tailwind you reported in the quarter? Steve MacMillan : Sure, Dan. I think there's a lot of runway ahead. If you think about it, we launched our first 3D systems in the United States almost eight years ago now. And in the meantime we've come up with better detectors. We've come up with particularly better software packages and then things like the SmartCurve paddle that also come with different algorithms and different software packages. So the ability to go back now as we think about the future it's not just converting our 2D to 3D. It's now looking at all of our existing 3D systems, many of whom were bought by early adopters and thought-leading institutions. So want to make sure they are staying on the cusp of state-of-the-art. And as we've come up with frankly better CAD packages, better packages software to be able to drive, there's a lot of opportunity there. And we do think that'll be a meaningful way. If you look at our SmartCurve paddle that's probably not even \u2013 it's just in a small percentage at this point of our existing 3D base. I mean, I'd say, it's probably certainly less than 20% and that's probably even less than that. So as you start to build it out. There's opportunities for years and years as well to just be upgrading our 3D while we continue to upgrade 2D. And I think that becomes part of the \u2013 it becomes a broader playbook than the days of yore. So we have so many things at our disposal now to drive that sustainable growth. Dan Leonard : And then my follow-up is a bit similar to Vijay's question from earlier. So I know that typically the December quarter is not a seasonally strong quarter for breast imaging, but it does seem like it was seasonally strong in the hospital capital spending environment. So based on whatever data or intelligence you have internally, do you have any way to isolate how much the performance might have been due to just healthy year-end customer budgets and healthy market as opposed to run rate performance in self-help? Steve MacMillan : Yeah. We don't have a great handle. You get a little anecdotes here or there. Somebody had some extra money in their budget at year-end and spent it, this kind of stuff. But it's also why we just want to be careful not to get too far ahead of ourselves. I'll tell you we feel very good about the underlying order trends. We feel very good about the competitive wins we're getting. We feel very good about a lot of what's going on in the business. But to \u2013 we can't be quite as granular saying, we got 160 bps that came from extra budgets being released or anything like that, that would just be pure speculation. Operator : All right. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan : Good afternoon. Steve MacMillan : Hey, Jack. Jack Meehan : My first question is on a topic I'm sure you love which is the adoption of ASC 606 with the new fiscal year. I'm curious relative to result under the prior standard did that impact the results in the quarter at all? I asked just I know there are some changes around revenue recognition. Just curious if that impacted the results versus if they have been reported under 605? Steve MacMillan : Jack, you'd be surprised. I think we'll let Karleen answer this one. Karleen Oberton : Yes, Jack. Jack, there was minimal impact in the quarter. I think the only \u2013 moving forward our business model aren't \u2013 there's no real meaningful change to our revenue recognition under our business model under the new rules. The only impact that we had was on adoption related to deferred revenues to the order of I think it was about $6 million to $8 million that was on our balance sheet that we really had no performance obligation, which is essentially written-off to retained earnings in the adoption, but other than that really no impact. Jack Meehan : Great. Yeah. Thank you for the clarification. And then did want to follow-up on the Molecular segment a two-parter. Just in the U.S. with some of the reimbursement changes, I'm curious what you're seeing on the pricing environment, if there's been any change for Molecular specifically. And then international growth looks pretty good. So maybe just talk about the adoption of Panther ex-U.S. would be helpful. Mike Watts : Hey, Jack, it's Mike on the first piece, I'll take that one. Yeah. The PAMA-related reimbursement cuts. As everybody knows nothing has changed dramatically in terms of our ASPs. Pricing depends on the quarter, but tends to be flat or down just a very little bit depending upon the product. I guess, the thing that I would point out is even as those reimbursement rates come down, you think about it it's still pretty good reimbursement for some of these tests especially that are helping bring patients into the facility and that are being run on a fully automated Panther instrument that doesn't really have a lot of additional labor costs associated with it. So there's still I think decent profit there. On the international piece, Steve did you want to take that? Steve MacMillan : Yes. I think International we've continued to be placing Panthers continued to drive menu particularly in Western Europe. I think we've made a lot of progress over the last few years. We've got a leader over there it's been doing great things. And the magic with every Panther we place the new start to menu coming in. We also just got a lot better tracking the metrics as well usage per Panther. There were days in the old days we used to sell a Panther and then it wouldn't get used. We've gotten so much just rigorous basic operational discipline and understanding every Panther around the world what it's doing, and if we can help drive more business through it working it that way, so no magic, just good hard work customer by customer making progress. Operator : The next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Q \u2013 David Lewis : Good afternoon. Steve, one for you and then one for Karleen. So Steve questions on breast on call and I think the strategic change in breast is getting a lot of attention, so just two kind of related questions there. Is the weighted market growth rate -- weighted average market growth rate for this business higher now? Are you saying that you can grow faster than weighted average market growth rate versus period of time based on some of the changes you made and what's the new number for this business? How do you see this business going forward? Steve MacMillan : Yes David. Just look at results versus past, I don't know that we've got a perfect weighted average market growth rate for the category. I do think if you look at the last 20 quarters or whatever, we've probably grown faster than whatever that weighted average market is. And we continue to try to be shifting and driving that to a higher number. Q \u2013 David Lewis : Okay. And then Karleen just a lot of questions on margins and you talked about currency. But revenue's up. Operating income is about the same. Is it all just currency or is there any select areas of reinvestment or conservatism? Because it looks like there's a limit of reinvestment as op income still the same by our math. Thanks so much. A \u2013 Karleen Oberton : Yes. So on an op income -- I think if you look at the sales and marketing lines are up specifically as we talked about the strategic changes in the Breast Health business. We have invested in that sales team to have a team that can sell the portfolio of products. So if there's been reinvestment that's where it's been. Operator : Next we'll go to Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Q \u2013 Doug Schenkel : Hey good afternoon guys. A \u2013 Steve MacMillan : Hey Doug. Q \u2013 Doug Schenkel : Just maybe starting on capital deployment, could you update us on your plan for 2019? You repurchased more shares more quickly than we expected and lowered share count guidance for the year. So I'm just wondering what we should think about in terms of our -- or how we should think about share repurchases for the balance of the year. And building off of that I'm just wondering if market volatility is impacting your M&A efforts at all. A \u2013 Karleen Oberton : So I'll start with that. So as we've talked about with the free cash flow, we originally guided at the beginning of 2019 that we estimated about $700 million. The priority there is clearly M&A. So we deployed about $125 million in the quarter on the Focal acquisition. And then what we've said it's going to be very opportunistic in regards to share repurchases after M&A. And I think we executed on that in the quarter and I think that's what you'll continue to see out throughout the balance of the year. Doug Schenkel : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just a couple follow-ups on Molecular Diagnostics. In your prepared remarks, Steve, you mentioned that you've been having a bit more success getting Panther customers to consolidate more menu on to Panthers. I'm wondering if this is primarily in the U.S., or if it's happening more broadly geographically. And I guess on the topic of virology and menu, I'm just curious if you'd be willing to comment whether you've had any success converting your two large lab customers to use viral load assays as part of the contract renewal. Thank you. Steve MacMillan : So Doug, probably on the first part of, whatever I was really talking about is, I think we're getting much more granular at getting smarter at penetrating wherever there's a Panther, making sure we're getting a lot more usage. I don't want to overplay that we're getting all this massive consolidation on to our Panthers. We still see huge opportunities for that. So it's more customer-by-customer, particularly outside the U.S., which was really my reference where we would've placed the Panther, it wasn't getting -- it might have been \u2013 being used for one assay instead of two or three or four. So we've been building that out more than anything. But I think, obviously, continuing to feel very good. And we're not going to comment on specifics of our largest customer contracts consistent with the -- our policies for quite some time. But there would be a huge inflection. I think you'd probably expect something of that that you're \u2013 we're seeing ongoing strength. Mike Watts : Operator, I think we might have time for one more question. Operator : Okay. Thank you, sir. We'll take our last question from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Raj Denhoy : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Steve MacMillan : Hi, Raj. Raj Denhoy : Maybe I could ask just a couple of cleanup ones here. So Focal and Faxitron, I guess, $12.2 million in the quarter. I know it's still early days. But anything in terms of what you think the opportunity set for that is now that you've had it for a while? And is your breast-conserving portfolio sort of fully baked here? Or where should we expect more acquisition in that category? Steve MacMillan : Yes. I think we feel really good about the sales teams we've got there and the products. We're still, I'd call, in a very early stages of pulling those sales teams together and leveraging especially the disposable side of the sales force. I think everything we've seen has reinforced that these are both good acquisitions that are on or above our new models. Not sure that we necessarily need more things in the portfolio. I think we feel good about that. I'd also say, it's most -- both are mostly U.S. businesses today. And again, over time probably significant opportunities outside the U.S. Those will come a little bit more over time as we ramp up the right organizations and some of that. But I think we're off to a really good start, really pleased. And as we've talked in the past, certainly, Raj you well know it, these are the great kind of the tuck-in deals that I think will be very good for us. Raj Denhoy : Great. And then, maybe just very last question, just on NovaSure. You mentioned still down, but expectations will improve over the course of the year. So any more detail around that, sort of the cadence of the approval and what's needed to actually get that back on track? Steve MacMillan : Sure. I think, certainly our own sales team is promoting it more. It's been an interesting one, because the whole GEA market has kind of dried up a little bit or shrunk really ever since one of the competitive products was taken off the market and in a weird way there maybe some competitors coming later in the year. The way we almost think about some of that is, it may actually reignite some discussion. There is still way too many hysterectomies done in this country. And I think as we get our messaging out a little deeper, we'll continue to try to strengthen that business. But it's clearly well established in an established category that hasn't been growing. And with that category not growing, given our very strong market share we've kind of been going sort of along the ways of the market. So we like to get it going back a little bit better. Raj Denhoy : Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Thanks Raj. Operator : Thank you everyone. That is all the time we have for question today.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic, Inc. Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Dory, I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Mike Watts : Thank you, Dory. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the Company\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session. Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them today. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through May 24. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release, and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic\u2019s CEO. Steve MacMillan : Thank you Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We\u2019re pleased to discuss Hologic\u2019s financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we posted strong results overall, as total revenue of $818.4 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58, both finished ahead of our guidance ranges. Like in recent periods, growth was driven by our largest businesses, Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics, and our international franchises continue to perform well. This quarter we also benefited from improved performance in our Surgical division. These strong revenue results continue the positive momentum that started to build in the second half of 2018, after we reorganized our leadership team earlier in the year. This momentum is based on some familiar strategies that we have discussed in the past. We continue to focus on accelerating growth by leveraging our core strengths and market-leading products, especially our large installed bases of Genius 3D mammography systems and Panther instruments, which in turn create tremendous recurring revenue streams. We are also increasing our penetration into international markets and broadening our product portfolios through both internal R&D and external business development. And we saw all these strategies pay off this quarter. With that brief introduction, let\u2019s discuss our second quarter results in more detail now. Revenue of $818.4 million grew 3.7% on a reported basis, or 5.2% in constant currency, ahead of our expectations. Within this, the acquired Faxitron and Focal businesses also exceeded plan, contributing $14.6 million to revenue, so we are off to a great start with these acquisitions. In terms of geography, domestic sales accelerated in the second quarter, posting growth of 4.6%, our best growth rate in six quarters. This was led by Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics, with improvement in Surgical as well. From a commercial perspective, we are executing better in our largest market, with a drive to continuously improve. Our legacy international franchises also performed well, recording our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth excluding blood screening and Cynosure. This strong, sustained performance clearly reflects the results of the significant leadership changes we put in place a few years ago. Molecular and Surgical had the highest growth rates on a percentage basis, and our Breast Health business also performed well. Including international sales of Cynosure products, which declined significantly in the period, total international sales were $202.9 million, still a solid increase of 6.9%. Now, let me provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. Let\u2019s start with our biggest business, Breast Health, where sales exceeded expectations and underlying trends remain strong. Global Breast Health sales totaled $321.5 million in the second quarter, a robust increase of 8.4%. If we look at the division on a pro forma basis, as if we owned Faxitron and Focal in the prior year period, Breast Health growth would have been about 4.9%. Breast Health growth was balanced geographically, with U.S. revenues increasing 8.8% and OUS sales rising 6.9%, as our commercial capabilities continue to strengthen around the world. Growth was also balanced between our breast imaging and interventional products, as our sales team focused on selling our growing portfolio. Our breast imaging segment grew 7.5%, while interventional sales increased a very strong 12.9%. As we have discussed, our Breast Health division today is much steadier and more diversified than it ever has been, with innovative, market-leading products across the continuum of patient care and across the globe. Our second quarter results illustrated this in several ways. First, our competitive position in our core mammography market remains very strong, based on clinically differentiated products and excellent customer relationships. We continue to install a consistent number of new 3D systems in the U.S., while maintaining premium pricing and high market shares. And proposed changes to the MQSA, which emphasize the importance of breast density, should drive further 3D conversion and prove to be an incremental positive for us if implemented. As a reminder, our Genius 3D mammograms are the only ones proven to be superior to traditional 2D mammography for women with dense breasts. As we\u2019ve been saying for some time, and as virtually all radiologists understand, all 3Ds are not created equal; we have indications in our label and published trials that demonstrate our differentiated performance. Second, new products are contributing more and more to Breast Health growth. Our new 3Dimensions and 3D Performance gantries, which help us segment our customer base better, again grew strongly and represented the majority of systems sold in the quarter. And other new products, including Intelligent 2D, Clarity HD, SmartCurve and the Affirm prone biopsy system, continue to be well-received by customers, with significant runway still ahead. Finally, sales of our Brevera biopsy system contributed slightly to growth in the quarter, although we expect to continue facing supply constraints over the medium term. And third, Focal and Faxitron, which we have combined into our new breast surgery franchise, are performing well. Combined sales in the quarter were $14.6 million, a robust pro forma increase of 40.4% that reflects our successful integration efforts and the power of Hologic\u2019s broader reach and resources. And we continue to be on the lookout for similar tuck-in acquisitions. Now, let\u2019s turn to Diagnostics, where revenue of $296.7 million increased a very strong 7.8%. Despite the external concerns around pricing in this market, this represents a material acceleration from recent quarters, although admittedly versus an easy prior-year comparable. Molecular remains the growth driver in this division. Based on the productivity of our R&D team and the sophistication of our commercial organization, we are emerging as a broad-based molecular diagnostics leader with strong customer partnerships. In the second quarter, worldwide molecular sales of $167.8 million grew 12.8%, an acceleration compared to recent periods and the highest growth rate in six quarters. Internationally, molecular grew 22.8%, well into the double-digits for the 11th time in 12 quarters. Although international is a small piece of our total molecular franchise, we are seeing very strong performance there. And in the U.S., although we already enjoy high market shares in key assay categories, molecular grew at a low-double-digit rate. This was better than in recent periods and reflects how we work collaboratively with our customers, especially our largest ones, to drive volumes and better patient care in established testing categories. Molecular growth was broad-based in the quarter as we leveraged the razor-razor blade business model built around the fully automated Panther and Panther Fusion systems. We continue to place more Panthers and drive increased utilization by helping customers consolidate testing on our systems. In the second quarter specifically, revenue growth was driven by strong global sales of our legacy women\u2019s health assays for chlamydia/gonorrhea, HPV and trichomonas, as well as new quantitative viral load tests. And thanks to our outstanding R&D and regulatory teams, which have now earned U.S. clearances in 10 consecutive quarters, we have many more assays and indications in development for markets around the world. So, we expect our Panther menu, which is already the broadest in the mid- to high-volume molecular space, to get even stronger. Moving on, cytology and perinatal sales were $115.5 million in the second quarter, a slight increase of 0.3%. Like last quarter, cytology sales increased fractionally, while perinatal sales declined. In the United States, growth in the cytology market remains challenged due to our high market shares and longer cervical cancer testing intervals. However, ThinPrep remains a core strength for us given the key role it plays in women\u2019s health, and the ability to run several of our molecular assays out of its collection vial. With this in mind, we are pleased to have recently earned FDA clearance for our ThinPrep Genesis Imager, which improves workflow for customers and facilitates co-testing with ThinPrep and our APTIMA HPV assay. And we expect more innovation in cytology over the next couple of years. Elsewhere in diagnostics, revenue related to our divested blood screening business was higher than expected at $13.4 million, an increase of 19% compared to last year. As a reminder, this revenue mainly reflects low-margin products and services under transition agreements we have with Grifols. We expect this revenue stream to decline from second quarter levels in the balance of this year and into 2020. Now, let\u2019s shift gears and cover GYN Surgical, where sales of $102.2 million grew 4.1%, our highest growth rate in seven quarters. While one quarter does not make a trend here, we are pleased to see our U.S. sales force strengthening, which is driving improvement in underlying business trends as well as our competitive position. In addition, it\u2019s important to note that new products such as our Fluent fluid management system and our Omni hysteroscope have begun contributing to growth. As a result, MyoSure-related sales grew at a low-double-digit rate in the second quarter. NovaSure sales declined again, but less than in recent periods. Now, let\u2019s turn to Medical Aesthetics, where sales of $73.8 million represented about 9% of consolidated revenue and declined 12.1%. Domestic revenue finished in line with our expectations, but sales outside the United States were weak, driven mainly by challenges in Asia. By product category, sales of women\u2019s health and other products declined low-double-digits in the quarter, while sales of our skin-related products declined in the high-single-digit range. And as we have previously discussed, increased competition in the non-invasive fat reduction category negatively affected sales of lasers as well as high-margin, consumable PAC keys. As a result, revenue in our body sub-category declined by a little more than 30%, and the long-term implications of this weakness contributed to our writing down the value of certain intangibles in the quarter. Karleen will talk about this more. Despite these challenges, there were some encouraging signs in Medical Aesthetics in the quarter. For example, in the United States, our sales force continues to come up to speed, with several regions showing good performance and growth. In fact, U.S. revenue increased slightly sequentially, bucking the trend in what is usually a seasonally weaker quarter. In addition, we are encouraged that initial customer feedback to our new partnership with Brooke Shields has been positive, and optimistic that our new marketing campaign will improve the performance of SculpSure in the future. To round out the revenue discussion briefly, Skeletal sales of $24.2 million grew 0.8%. Although our revenue base is small here, we remain enthusiastic about the potential of our DXA systems to assess body composition in athletes. So, to wrap up, the major storylines at Hologic haven\u2019t changed much over the last three months. In simple terms, our key strategy of leveraging our core technologies and leadership positions, especially in Breast Health and Diagnostics, to expand our offerings both geographically and in adjacent product categories is paying off. For the last four quarters, this strategy has led to very good financial results, which gives us the confidence to increase our guidance for 2019. Karleen will discuss that guidance in a moment. So, now, let me turn the call over to her. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I\u2019m going to walk through the rest of the income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, and then finish up with our updated financial guidance for 2019, as well as the third quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis in constant currency. As Steve described, we are pleased with our second quarter results, as revenue of $818.4 million and EPS of $0.58 exceeded our guidance. We benefited from strong performances by our largest businesses, Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics, as well as improved results in our Surgical division. And our international franchises continued to grow solidly. Our overall performance has been very solid through the first half of our fiscal year, and we are again raising our financial guidance as a result. Although 90% of our business is doing well, our Medical Aesthetics business continues to lag, as everyone knows. As Steve said, we did see some positive signs in the quarter, but as we kicked off our annual strategic planning process, it became clear that from an accounting perspective, we needed to lower the carrying value of our intangible assets and equipment associated with key products like SculpSure, MonaLisa Touch and TempSure Vitalia. As a result, we booked a significant GAAP write-down of $443.8 million this quarter, which hit COGS primarily but also other operating expenses. This action, which is non-cash, is in addition to the write-down we recorded a year ago, which related to goodwill and in-process R&D. So, while this write-down is disappointing, I want to emphasize that it primarily reflects negative trends that we have previously discussed, and which we expect to improve based on the strategies we have in place. Now, I\u2019d like to switch gears and review our P&L for the second quarter. Gross margins of 61% decreased 170 basis points compared to the prior year period. Let me provide some color to help illustrate why we expect gross margins to improve in the back half of the year. Several one-time items contributed to the decline in gross margin percentage this quarter, including inventory reserves, scrap charges and other adjustments, especially in Medical Aesthetics as we integrate our international locations. Together with foreign exchange and Chinese tariffs, these non-recurring items reduced gross margin percentage by approximately 110 basis points this quarter. The rest of the gross margin decline resulted from factors we have discussed in the past such as product mix, especially Cynosure\u2019s performance, and higher blood screening revenue. So, as we look toward the back half of the year, we expect better margins due to the absence of these one-time charges, improved product mix, absorption benefits, the ramp-up of new product sales, and our ongoing cost reduction efforts. Moving on, total operating expenses of $272.8 million increased 2.2% in the second quarter. This increase was mainly driven by the impact of the Faxitron and Focal acquisitions, which contributed roughly $6.6 million of expense. Excluding Faxitron and Focal, operating expenses actually declined 0.3%, reflecting a balance between tight cost controls and funding of our investments for future growth. Operating margin of 27.7% declined 120 basis points in the second quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to the negative gross margin effects that I discussed. I do want to point out, however, that when you analyze the full geography of our income statement, the currency and compensation hedges we have in place below the line offset much of this operating margin decline. So, for example, if you look at adjusted EBITDA of $254.1 million, you\u2019ll see that it increased 2.4% compared to the prior year period. And EBITDA margin declined only slightly, to 31.0% this year versus 31.4% last year. Overall, our profitability remains healthy, and our updated guidance implies that operating margin will increase in the back half of the year, mainly due to the expected gross margin improvements I mentioned. Finally, net margins of 19.0% increased 30 basis points compared with the prior year period, primarily due to benefits associated with an improvement in our effective tax rate. Our tax rate is lower than our previous guidance primarily because the U.S. Treasury has clarified certain provisions of federal tax reform through proposed regulations. All this led to non-GAAP net income of $155.9 million in the second quarter, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58, exceeding our guidance range. Before we cover our revised 2019 guidance, I\u2019ll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. At the end of the second quarter, our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, stood at 2.6 times. We remain comfortable around this level, recognizing that the ratio could fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and buyback activity. Finally, we generated $104.2 million of free cash flow in the second quarter. We continue to generate strong cash flows, which enable us to pursue tuck-in acquisitions such as Faxitron and Focal while also acting on our share repurchase authorization as we see opportunities in the market. Now, I\u2019d like to shift gears and discuss our non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and third quarter. At a high level, we are updating our full-year guidance based on our good second quarter results and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by increased investments we plan to make over the next two quarters. More specifically, we are increasing our constant currency revenue guidance and raising our EPS forecast. Let\u2019s start with revenue. As a reminder, we previously guided to sales of $3.305 billion to $3.335 billion, which represented constant currency growth of between 3.8% and 4.7%. Based on our second quarter results, we are increasing our revenue guidance to $3.325 billion to $3.345 billion, which includes approximately $45 million of revenue from our divested blood screening business. Based on recent exchange rates, our new revenue guidance translates to constant currency growth of 4.3% to 4.9%, better than our prior 2019 forecast. As you know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened materially compared to our prior fiscal year. And based on recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency fluctuations are driving roughly $30 million of headwind in fiscal 2019. Despite this foreign exchange headwind, we feel confident about our growth in our core businesses, our ability to control expenses, and the lower effective tax rate. As a result, we are increasing our EPS guidance to a range of $2.41 to $2.44, which represents reported growth of between 8.1% and 9.4%, roughly double a rate of revenue growth. I should point out that EPS growth would be higher if not for diminishing contributions from our divested blood screening business and a small residual impact from currency. The updated full-year guidance is based on diluted shares outstanding of approximately 272 million for the full year, and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%, a 1% improvement compared to our prior guidance. Now, let\u2019s turn to guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect revenue of between $825 million and $840 million, which represents growth of 1.2% to 3% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, our guidance reflects revenue growth of 0.1% to 1.9%. Since we only have two quarters left in our fiscal year, our revised annual guidance implies that as usual, revenues will be bigger in the fourth quarter than the third, based on seasonality and new products making increasing contributions. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.60 to $0.62 in the third quarter, which implies growth rates of between 3.4% and 6.9%, continuing to outpace revenue growth. As you update your forecasts, we would encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance ranges, as we\u2019ve tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. This is particularly important after the dollar strengthened further last week. Before we open up the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that we are pleased with our performance through the first half of 2019, with our Breast Health, Molecular Diagnostic and international businesses driving solid growth. We are also encouraged by improved performance in our Surgical division. These businesses are well-positioned to drive further growth, given the strategies we have in place. Lastly, we continue to generate industry-leading cash flows and put that cash to good use, with a focus on tuck-in acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchases. Based on all this, we are raising our annual financial guidance. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please go ahead, sir. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. I'll start with Breast Health, Steve, obviously putting up good numbers there. Can you maybe talk about the replacement cycle? How much is the legacy installed 3D base you're starting to upgrade with 3Dimensions in 3D Performance. And then, Faxitron and Focal are obviously adding a lot, how much cross-selling and bundling are you doing there too? Steve MacMillan : In terms of the existing base versus the new, the vast majority of our revenue is still coming from selling new 3Ds to both competitive customers, as well as upgrading our existing 3Ds. I think, as we mentioned, we still got, 3,000 to 6,000 installed 2Ds left in the U.S. So, we\u2019ve still got years worth of replacements. and that's still the primary driver of our Breast Health business, which makes us feel so good about the sustainability, while we're starting to get certainly some of the grades, but they clearly are much smaller percentages of total on the upgrades. As it relates to Faxitron and Focal, it's been very nice and that we've been able to merge the sales forces, put them together and off to a very nice start as we really start to sell the breast conserving surgery line, as well as a couple of our own legacy products that are in there. And, I would say, we're still deep down in the earlier stages. This was really the first quarter that the combined selling organizations were on the street together. And we feel really good about the initial starts there. Tycho Peterson : And then, one follow-up on guidance. So, you do have a new competitor for NovaSure [indiscernible]. Just curious how you think about competitive positioning, and if you've seen any kind of impact at this point. Steve MacMillan : We are always mindful of new competitors coming into the space. Having said that, at this point, NovaSure has been safely and effectively used in 3 million patients at this point, and has a very strong, proven history and loyal base. We're out there telling that story every day. We've not yet seen any real impact from commercialization of anything. We certainly would expect some over time. But frankly, we feel really good about particularly the total efficacy of our product relative to any comers. Operator : And we will take our next question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir. Dan Leonard : Thank you. So, I want to ask a couple on the molecular business. First, Steve, can you confirm that any price adjustments with large customers were in the numbers for the full quarter? And any color you can give on maybe how pricing and volume dynamics contributed to that double-digit growth rate you reported in molecular? Steve MacMillan : Sure, Dan. As we had said, we did finalize those contracts last year, virtually all of any of the pricing changes were in the quarter. So, this is, I want to say, quite a new run rate, but from a pricing standpoint, basically reflected in there. And I think what we feel really good, I know there was so much concern last summer with PAMA and with the renegotiations and everything else. We feel great about the relationships we've got with our largest customers. We are driving volume is really the big driver. And we ended up with pricing that really makes sense for both our customers, but particularly for us and feeling particularly on the molecular side very good about the runway ahead. Dan Leonard : And then, it's interesting that you\u2019re flagging your legacy women's health assays as the big contributor here. Can you update us on how fast do you think that category is growing in the market? And how much faster are you growing compared to the category to your share gain? Steve MacMillan : Sure. I don't think we have great data on the full category. But, we think it continues to grow part of our whole messaging. And it's what's helped us so much, frankly, with our largest customers is our physician sales force that continues to help educate the physicians and particularly our Yes Means Test campaign of trying to make sure that younger sexually active women are getting tested, we do think continues to drive the overall category. So, this is one of these categories we looked at a few years ago and thought maybe not much growth left, but realizing that actually the true incidence of testing is, while we don't have a great feel, is clearly less than what should be done. And so, we've been really helping to drive that category. And I think as the predominant share player, probably actually still growing faster than the category itself. And, Mike? Mike Watts : Yes, Dan, it\u2019s Mike. I might just add one thing. And obviously, those tests are all not alike, right? So, a like trichomonas is still fairly underpenetrated. Obviously, the growth rates there would be much higher than for the base chlamydia/gonorrhea business. And we would expect the same thing to happen with the new test like MGen over time as well. Operator : And we'll be taking our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Please go ahead, sir. Chris Lin : Hey, this is Chris on for Doug today. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow-up on the previous question. I know you don't to be too granular with molecular diagnostics performance, but could you just help us assess sustainability or the double-digit growth rate for the segment? I mean, you have introduced a number of assays and you're still pretty early with the viral load opportunity. So, is it right to think that molecular diagnostics could at least grow double digits for the balance of the year? Steve MacMillan : We would not guide to double-digit for the rest of the year. We did mention we had an easier comp. I think we had a very good first quarter, we had an easier comp this quarter. I think, we feel very good about strong sustainable rates but would not model for sustained double-digit. I think outside the U.S., yes; inside the U.S., I\u2019d probably be modeling more mid to maybe slightly higher single-digit growth. But, I think we\u2019d like the overall trajectory. Chris Lin : Okay. And then, for the follow-up question, could you just help us dissect the gross and operating margin performance, a bit more detail? I appreciate the commentary on some of the onetime charges but even if we back out those costs, margins would have been a bit below Street expectation, despite the strong revenue contribution from the high-margin businesses of Molecular Diagnostics and Cytology. So, I\u2019m just curios what are those some of the other headwinds for margins. Karleen Oberton : Hi. This is Karleen. So, let me take a stab at that. I think beyond the onetime items, we clearly had higher blood screening revenue than we anticipated. And to remind everyone, there\u2019s virtually no gross margin on that revenue. Coupled with some of the products mix that we had in the quarter, specifically in the Cynosure business, contributed to the margin headwind. Operator : We will be taking our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Maybe a couple on guidance here. Just, Karleen, on the gross margins here, the one timers as you called, what is the visibility that you have in gross margin stepping up? When you talk gross margins improving in the back half, is this all gross margin driven, and I guess the implications that the revenue mix in the back half it should be similar to what we saw in 2Q? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So, I think what gives us confidence in the back half is that we don\u2019t pursue those onetime items again and again. Majority of those related to the Cynosure business and some of the integration activities that are now substantially complete for the international locations. I think when we look at the back half of the year, our normal cadence is that revenues increase as well as volumes increase which are going to drive favorable absorption just as well as overall larger gross margin dollars. From a planning perspective, the teams have cost reduction efforts that kind of kick off at the beginning of the fiscal year and start to really contribute as we get to the back of to the year. Vijay Kumar : And then, one follow-up on the guidance here. You beat EPS by same. [Ph] You look at the tax rate lower, it almost looks like most of the guidance range came from the lowering of tax rate. I\u2019m just curious, is there anything happening below the line in the back half on the FX hedges and how should we be thinking of some of those items? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I don\u2019t think there is anything unusual in the bank half below the line that we\u2019ve anticipated in the guidance. I think, as we think about the guidance, yes, there is definitely beat in the quarter, there is some benefit from lower tax rate. But we'd really like to -- what we also want to do is allow the R&D teams to invest some more in the back half to accelerate some projects. Vijay Kumar : FX hedges should be gained in the back half? Karleen Oberton : In theory, yes. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will be taking our next question from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please go ahead, sir. Jack Meehan : I was hoping on the GYN Surgical business. Could you break out the contributions from NovaSure and MyoSure? And Steve, I was curious, just given the growth rates for MyoSure, how much runway you think there is left to drive adoption to get up to the NovaSure level? Karleen Oberton : So, let me start off with the contribution. So, on a worldwide basis, total Surgical division was about $102 million with a little over 40% of that comes from NovaSure and the balance from MyoSure. Steve MacMillan : So, to pick up on it, MyoSure has become the bigger part, and it's defied our expectations for a long time, and seems to continue to grow. We still see opportunities, frankly, to grow the overall category, and continue to feel good as that being a major driver for Surgical, particularly as the U.S. sales force has gotten back up to speed and in a strong place today. Mike Watts : Yes. I think, Jack, in the prepared remarks we mentioned that MyoSure in aggregate grew very low-double-digits in the quarter and NovaSure was consistent with recent quarters, it didn't go down as much kind of in that low to mid-single-digit decline range. And Dory, for you. It\u2019s fine to allow folks to ask one follow-up question to. So, Jack, if you have a follow-up, go ahead. Steve MacMillan : Got to be related, though, Jack. Got to be related. Jack Meehan : Well, maybe on the NovaSure point then. I\u2019d just be curious, as you look at the back half and then the 2020, do you think that this can get back to growth or are you thinking that kind of stabilization is the right way to be thinking about this business for you? Steve MacMillan : I think stabilization is probably about the best we can do just given how penetrated we are in a category that's probably not really going -- growing and may have some competitors emerge. So, I think, we continue to keep that flat as probably a pretty good performance. Operator : And we will be taking our next question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead, sir. Bill Quirk : So first question is going back to the molecular franchise. And I was hoping, Steve, maybe get a little color on -- helping us think about the incremental growth. How much of this is kind of new accounts versus existing accounts adding some of the new menu that you\u2019ve had approved? And then, as a related question, a couple of your large customers were just added to the UnitedHealth Preferred Lab Network, and would be curious about how you're thinking about that incrementally driving some performance here over the next couple years? Steve MacMillan : Sure. I think, we don't have the exact breakout as to new customers versus existing because sometimes as they consolidate and things like that. I'd say that the simple way to think about it is, we are getting more business with our existing customers. We're clearly seeing frankly some nice increases with our two largest customers. We continue also to place Panthers across the network. And so we see ongoing growth there. But, I think it's particularly we feel really good about our position with the two biggest customers. And especially to your point, as they pick up a little more business in the quarters and years ahead with United Health and some of their various contracts, we like our position with them and think that's going to continue to help drive some good strength. Anything else, Bill? Bill Quirk : Oh, sure, absolutely. So, a related follow-up question to the total business that is. Just help us think little bit about, I guess, one, sustainability of OUS Breast Health? And then, secondly, could you just revisit the topic of kind of how 3D adoption is going, specifically in Europe? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : That was a clever related that you worked -- one follow-up related into two different ones. Good Job, Bill. So, I'm sorry, the sustainability of Breast Health... Karleen Oberton : Yes. I think, first was the international sustainability. And I think, we feel really good about that. I think there's a lot of runway. It\u2019s early days on the overall conversion to 3D there internationally, coupled with still opportunities to go direct in key markets. Operator : And we will be taking our next question from Dan Brennan with UBS. Please go ahead, sir. Dan Brennan : Great, thank you. Thanks for taking the questions. Steve, I wanted to ask you a question. Given the growing signs of success of your strategy in imaging via more expanded product sets to meet the needs of the different sized customers, what's the realistic runway you think as we look out for that U.S. breast imaging business, now that you\u2019ve potentially mitigated some of the more cyclicality inherent in that business? Steve MacMillan : Yes. I think, Dan, overall, we always want to be too careful to get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of longer term outlooks. I think, if you look at the pure mammography business in the U.S., it's probably not grown all that much. The number of gantries is going to be relatively flat probably five years from now as it is today. So, as we had seen that all along, we thought, okay, it's all about broadening the portfolio, figuring out other ways to bring value to it. So, I\u2019d probably still think about it as a low to mid single digit kind of business. And I think our ability to take share and find new avenues above that are what can take us to outperform what is probably much more of a lower single digit market. And obviously we\u2019re very focused on outperforming it. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you for that, Steve. And then, maybe this is correlated. So, basically, you made the mention in the prepared remarks regarding the dense breast proposals out of the FDA. I'm just wondering, to the extent those get implemented, could you help us think about giving your superior label there? And this is the question we've gotten numerous times to investors like, how should we think about the opportunity for you to kind of market that and how that would translate into and impact on the business? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Sure. This could sound flippant, but I\u2019d basically consider anybody that would use anybody other than our system would be malpractice. But having said that, I think what it does is, you guys know the market shares, which we don't talk about a lot, but we're by far the dominant player in the space, particularly in the U.S. And I think our ability to continue to keep growing our market share off a very high levels, should continue to be there, given the dense breast indication that we have. Operator : And our next question will be coming from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir. David Lewis : Steve, maybe start with you for a second on investments and work maybe one follow-up. Just quickly on investments, Steve, just as you think about capital deployment, at this point with the Aesthetics business. Is there any consideration now with the write-down that you look to divest that business or sell that business? And related to that is, right now as you think about the balance sheet, what is your interest in deploying capital for M&A and sort of where do you think the key strategic areas are for the business? Steve MacMillan : Sure, David. We continue to manage the Company for the long haul. And obviously not every decision we\u2019ve made has been perfect. But we continue to strengthen the business. And frankly, we are excited about some of what we have going on, even in Medical Aesthetics right now. So, we have some great sales people, Brooke Shields joining on as a partner, we feel really good about that. Having said that the broader piece of capital deployment, I think as you\u2019re really seeing, really focused more on a lot of our core businesses and particularly the biggest divisions. So, the two that we\u2019ve done in Breast Health, we feel great about. And I think we really are to a stage that we weren\u2019t a few years ago, which is truly just tuck-ins. And so, the broader capital deployment that can refine good tuck-ins that fit our existing businesses, no need to open additional legs, invest in the businesses that are delivering and executing, and from that also continuing to do with cash left over, both ongoing share repurchases, debt paydown and being very prudent at this point in time with our capital. Karleen, do you want to add anything to that. Karleen Oberton : Yes. No, I would just say, clearly, we view M&A as a priority from a tuck-in perspective, but the teams are bring really critical at the targets we evaluate here. But there\u2019s an activity that\u2019s ongoing. David Lewis : Just a quick follow-up, Steve. This is a very balanced quarter relative to last quarter, we saw very significant Breast growth, Breast growth still above market this quarter. Last quarter, you gave us a lot of color in terms of gantry outlook and the pipeline and the transition to that pipeline. So, can you just update on sort of where -- how you feel about the gantry backlog kind of mid part of the year? That\u2019d be very helpful. Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Sure. We continue to feel very good about the backlog and the ongoing order rates that we track obviously on a very regular basis, but feel good about the ongoing orders growth in the gantry business. Operator : And we will take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Please go ahead sir. Brian Weinstein : Steve, on the breastsoftware upgrades that I recognize it\u2019s early, but can you talk to us a little bit about what you're seeing there and what this potentially could become for you, longer term? I think, in the past you\u2019ve given us some revenue numbers in the quarter, and any thought on that would be welcome as well. Steve MacMillan : Sure. We\u2019re still in the early stages of starting to upgrade our existing 3Ds, but between Clarity HD, Intelligent -- the Intelligent software and the SmartCurve paddles. So, they are relatively small but starting to be somewhat meaningful within that division, but still very early stages. And I think it provides just long-term runway. So, it\u2019s -- I would say the way we're thinking about it day-to-day, Brian, the organization is very focused on continuing to convert 2Ds to 3Ds, but also going back and circling and seeing the opportunities, clearly things like the SmartCurve paddle, and the Clarity HD, very nice add-ons to our existing business and a lot of runway ahead. Brian Weinstein : On the follow-up there, when we think about OUS, can you just give us a little bit more color on specific countries and areas where you\u2019ve seen particular strength? And Karleen, your comment about opportunities to go direct in key markets, can you expand on that and the likelihood that we would see something there at some point this year? Karleen Oberton : So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be specific, countries that we\u2019re looking to go direct, but just that there are opportunities that we're considering in certain of our key markets as not all distributors are actionable either. So, weighing all the characters of the targets. Steve MacMillan : Yes. I think, Brian, we do feel good about obviously over the last 5, 6, 7 years, even we\u2019d gone direct in the UK before. I arrived and we\u2019ve obviously done great acquisitions in Germany, in Portugal and Spain. So, we\u2019re now directing three of the biggest countries, certainly in Europe and continuing to look at how to strengthen our capabilities there, and also doing well in the countries where we\u2019ve now converted from dealer to direct. So, like the foundation of the building over there. Karleen Oberton : I\u2019d just also add Brian just from an international perspective in the Breast Health, that we talked to just a lot about Europe, but obviously Asia Pacific, there\u2019s a lot of got good momentum and opportunity there moving forward. Operator : And we will take our next question from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir. Anthony Petrone : The first question I\u2019ll have is on Breast Health and then I\u2019ll shift to GYN Surgical [technical difficulty] in diagnostics the first question. My question there is on OUS molecular, the number jumps off the page, 22% growth, and I think it comes with the clearance from a competitor. I think Abbott announced CE mark clearance for Alinity in certain essays. So, just kind of trying to get a sense of the sustainability of OUS molecular just given the competitive landscape and a follow-up will be on surgical. Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Sure. I think, we continue to feel really good about our OUS molecular business. The growth rate is 11 out of 12 quarters in a row, we had double-digit growth rates. And we\u2019re still relatively underdeveloped. So, even though there are competitors out there, we\u2019re still in our earlier stages of growth. So, it\u2019s still a relatively smaller business for us. And yes, there is competitors there but I think we feel pretty good about our ability to continue to grow at certainly healthy rates. Karleen Oberton : Yes. And I would just add that in key countries we don\u2019t have the full menu approved that we have here in the U.S. So, we have focused strategies on trying to get the menus expanded in key countries that will drive higher utilization. So, a lot of good stuff there as well. Anthony Petrone : And a quick follow-up in surgical would just be the litigation front there and endometrial ablation and gave us an update a few weeks ago. Does that have an impact going forward, or is it more just similar competitive dynamics we should see over the next 12 months, two years? Thanks. Mike Watts : Yes. Anthony, it\u2019s Mike. I think, the competitive dynamics there are very stable. We believe we are maintaining share and in some cases, winning customers back, which I think is a testament to the work that's going on in the field. And, obviously, don't want to get too much into an open legal process, but the normal, kind of appeals and all that stuff continues to go on. And, we'll just give you an update when we have one. Operator : And we will take our next question from Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. JaimeMorgan: Hi. This is Jaime on for Rich. So, I wanted to ask a couple of questions on Medical Aesthetics. I guess, the first being, you guys are saying U.S. was in line, OUS was a little bit weaker driven by Asia. So, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the dynamics that you're seeing in that market that's impacting growth, and then I'll have a follow-up. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So, I think, given the international markets, I think, as I had mentioned, we are kind of ongoing and integrating into our leadership, our regional leadership structure. And so, as we make some of those changes, we've had some disruption on the cadence of sales there. I think as we integrate, we kind of looked at some policies and procedures and had some accounting adjustments that we made as well, but feel good over the longer term that as our leaders take control this business we\u2019ll have nice cadence of growth. Jaime Morgan : Okay. And then, I guess, my follow-up would just be, are you seeing anything more within the competitive -- from a competitive perspective across some of the different units, specifically body? And kind of what is the expectation for the remainder of the year, given some of these new strategies that you talked about with Brooke Shields? And any other potential color that you can give around, strategies you are rolling out would be helpful. Thank you. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So, what I would say is that clearly, we've talked about we have seen competitive factors in the Medical Aesthetics business, specifically in the body sub-segment. Now, we are excited about the Brooke Shields campaign and what that will be able to do, but don't know how meaningful it will be, at this point. I think what I would focus on is what our key strategy is, in-license additional products, to put more in the bag of our sales team to create that cadence of new products, excitement for that sales team, what we think will contribute to turnaround in the U.S. business. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead. Jon Block : Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. I'll probably just go for a clarification and then a small question on Breast. So, Karleen, the onetime color was very helpful with gross margin. I just want to make sure, when you say higher and fiscal 2H, just to be clear, is that off the 61% non-GAAP or is that off this adjusted, call it 62? And then maybe, what are your thoughts longer term for gross margin? And then I\u2019ll ask a quick follow-up? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So, I would say, it's off the adjusted 62, is what we expect in the back half. And I think, as we said, we're not giving longer term guidance. But, I think looking at gross margin in that low-60s is the right way to think about them. Jon Block : Okay. So, just as we think about an exit rate or a run rate, pay more attention to the fiscal 2H 2019 there. Karleen Oberton : Yes. I think there is some noise in the first half. Steve MacMillan : Yes. Jon Block : Okay. And then, Steve, I\u2019ll pivot. I think, Medical Aesthetics has sort of been asked and answered for the most part. But just over to Brevera, can you just talk about the timing for supply to get back on track there? And then what are the actual plans itself? In other words, is that something you're going take in house from a manufacturing standpoint, or will you continue to outsource that? Thanks, guys. Steve MacMillan : Sure. Thanks, Jon. I think, we\u2019re probably -- before we\u2019re in really great shape on supply is probably well into next fiscal year because we do have a partner and we're obviously working with that partner right now to resolve the longer term piece. But, we're making some product enhancements to it to make it simpler to make and get beyond the short-term situations we\u2019ve been in. Operator : And we will take our next question from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Mark Massaro : Given the dynamics in Medical Aesthetics, should we be thinking about pro forma run rate in the negative double digits or do you think that\u2019s the initiative with Brookfield can potentially move you up into the right? Karleen Oberton : So, I think as we think about when started the fiscal year we thought this would be a low single grower. I think that\u2019s based on the performance in the last two quarter, as we think about fiscal \u201819, it\u2019s probably low to mid single digit decliner. But, I think what we see is improvements in each quarter as we move through the year. Mark Massaro : Okay. And then, related to that I guess could you give us a little bit of help about thinking about the cost of the clinical trials with Vitalia and MonaLisa Touch? I don\u2019t think the Brooke Shields marketing would be all that expensive. But I guess my question is, when you factor in the clinical trials costs, the marketing costs, why do you think that keeping the Medical Aesthetics business is worth more than divesting it? Steve MacMillan : Obviously, we\u2019re continuing to focus and thinking smartly about where we go for the future, and investing prudently in the business. So, we're being smart about how we gauge the spending at this point in time. It\u2019s clearly not making the kind of money that we would like, and in fact losing a little bit in the short-term. And we\u2019re in that process of putting together our longer term plans. Mike Watts : And, I would say, -- Mark, it\u2019s Mike, I would just add to that. I mean, products like MonaLisa Touch I mean really are very valuable, clinically differentiated products that provide a lot of value to women. So, we definitely want to proceed those indications that will enable us to differentiate ourselves in the market. Mark Massaro : Okay. Thank you. Mike Watts : Dory, I think, we\u2019ve got time for one more question. Operator : And we will be taking our final question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is Ivy [ph] on for Derik today. Thank you for squeezing me in. Congrats on quarter. So, just one clarification question on the Breast Health. It sounds like the momentum of Breast health should continue. So, given updated guide, are there any changes on the growth perspective for the sector, particularly given the given the tough comp in first half of the year? Just any additional color would be helpful. Thank you. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So, I think as we started the fiscal year for Breast Health, we had talked about it being mid-single-digit grower. I would say that based on the performance of the last two quarters for the full year, maybe it's mid to high-single-digit growth. So, yes, you're right the comp\u2019s definitely get harder in the back half of the year and so the growth might come down a bit. Unidentified Analyst : And one follow-up. So, this quarter, the acquisitions Focal and Faxitron was better than expected. Is that something we should base of estimates for the rest of the year? Looking for just any additional color. Thank you. Karleen Oberton : So, they had meaningful growth in this quarter. I would say that we expect high-double-digit from them moving forward, but I don't know that it would be in the 40% range. It should be come down. Steve MacMillan : Great. Thank you, everyone. Mike Watts : I think, that's all the time we have. Thanks everybody very much. Operator : This now concludes the Hologic\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. Have a good evening.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to the Hologic Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Eduardo and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would like now to introduce Mr. Mike Watts, Vice President Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call. Thank you. Mike Watts : Thank you, Eduardo. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's President Chairman and CEO; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through October -- through August, excuse me, 23rd. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Steve MacMillan : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, our fifth consecutive quarter of strong consistent overall results. Total revenue of $852.4 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.63 were both above our guidance. Similar to recent periods, revenue growth was driven by our largest businesses Molecular Diagnostics and Breast Health and we're also happy that the performance of our Surgical division continues to strengthen. These strong results continue the positive momentum that started to build in our core businesses throughout 2018. During this time, each of our divisions has made progress to varying degrees on the four strategic levers we can pull to drive growth. Let me touch on each of these to illustrate both the progress we have made and the opportunities ahead. First, commercial execution in the United States has been our strong suit, enabled by our excellent sales teams and best-in-class products such as our Genius 3D Mammography systems, our Panther molecular diagnostics instrument, our ThinPrep liquid pap test and our MyoSure and NovaSure surgical devices. Across these core brands, we are executing effectively as we build on our number one market shares, maintain premium pricing, and partner with our customers to drive demand. These products are the foundation for our strategy and overall financial success. But since we already have high domestic market shares in some lower growth end markets, we need to do more to drive attractive growth. That's where the other three strategic levers come in. To start, we have worked hard over the last several years to expand into international markets where we have much more headroom to grow shares than we do domestically. Not long ago some of you may recall that I described our business outside the United States as a startup or said another way, it was basically treated as an export business. Today, thanks to strong leadership and very deliberate efforts to build our channel strength international has emerged as a solid and consistent grower. Third, we have doubled down on innovation and revitalized our R&D pipelines to build around our core product assets. Today, after several years of significant changes in our R&D capabilities, all of our divisions have established a healthy cadence of innovation for the first time and the results are beginning to benefit our financials. For example sales of recently launched products totaled more than $180 million in the third quarter. This represented about 21% of our total revenue and grew more than 40% compared to a year ago. And fourth to supplement our organic growth, we have announced three tuck-in acquisitions over the last year all built around our Breast Health core to further diversify our revenue and enable us to operate across the continuum of patient care. Given the strength of our cash flows and balance sheet, we believe these smaller deals will be an important part of our future growth and hopefully not just in Breast Health. With that introduction let's discuss our third quarter results in more detail. Revenue of $852.4 million grew 4.7% in constant currency ahead of our expectations. Within this the acquired Faxitron and Focal businesses contributed $12.8 million to revenue and we are off to a good start with these deals. Excluding sales from our divested blood screening business which declined in the third quarter, revenue of $838.2 million grew 5.3% in constant currency. This was an acceleration of 30 basis points sequentially compared to our second quarter growth rate. In terms of geography, domestic sales of $642.5 million increased a healthy 4.2% in the third quarter. Excluding our divested Blood Screening business again U.S. growth would have been 5.0% accelerating for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our largest franchises Molecular Diagnostics and Breast Health once again led the charge as we continue to build around our Panther and Genius installed bases. Additionally, we are also pleased to see our U.S. Surgical business improve again continuing the steady progress that began early last year. Outside the United States, sales of $209.9 million increased 6.2% in constant currency. This was a solid performance, but growth was a little slower than the recent quarters mainly due to macroeconomic and political challenges in our small Latin American business which is mostly Breast Health. Excluding Latin America, OUS growth would have been about 200 basis points higher. More broadly total Diagnostics and Surgical both grew low double digits outside the United States and Medical Aesthetics returned to growth as well. Now let me provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. Let's start with our biggest business Breast Health where underlying trends remain strong. Global Breast Health sales finished inline with our expectations in the third quarter and totaled $325.4 million, a solid increase of 6.7% against a tough prior year comparable. As we have said many times before, our Breast Health division today is much steadier and more diversified than it ever has been with innovative market-leading products across the continuum of patient care and around the globe. In terms of geography, domestic sales drove Breast Health growth in the quarter with revenue increasing a very strong 8.9%. OUS Breast Health sales declined by 1.5%. This was driven mainly by the challenges in Latin America that I mentioned earlier as well as the annualization of some prior year tender wins and order timing. In terms of subsegments, imaging sales grew 6.1% while interventional sales increased 9.5% as we focus on selling our growing portfolio. In imaging, sales of our Genius 3D systems increased strongly driven by our new 3Dimensions and 3D Performance gantries. These innovative new products have now clearly established themselves at the heart of our capital portfolio. Other new products including Intelligent 2D, Clarity HD and SmartCurve also contributed nicely to imaging growth as did revenue from our acquired Faxitron business. In interventional our third quarter results benefited from our focus on portfolio selling as well as revenue from our acquired Focal business. These positives more than offset a headwind from lower Brevera sales due to the supply constraints we have previously discussed. Before I turn to Diagnostics, I want to spend a minute on our pending acquisition of SuperSonic Imagine or SSI a French innovator in cart-based ultrasound technology. This tuck-in deal is very consistent with our capital deployment goals. It's fairly small at an enterprise value of roughly $85 million and leverages our existing call points. It's also expected to be accretive to our revenue growth rate, albeit with some slight dilution to EPS in the near term. We have wanted to expand in ultrasound for a while as the technology is used across the full continuum of Breast Health patient care. We had previously done a small distribution deal to sell the Viera portable ultrasound scanner and acquiring SuperSonic Imagine will enable us to further enter the larger cart-based market which has been growing at a high single-digit rate. Having evaluated several targets in this space over the past few years, we believe that SSI's newest product the Aixplorer MACH 30 represents best-in-class technology highlighted by excellent image quality. So SSI will support our reputation for providing clinically-differentiated products. The MACH 30 is used as a supplement to mammography for screening women with dense breasts and also to help guide biopsies and surgeries. Importantly, less than 15% of SSI's revenue is generated in the United States which provides an excellent opportunity to leverage our strong domestic sales channel. Over time we are hopeful that the MACH 30 can develop into a platform a bit like Genius, one that enjoys significant clinical differentiation and onto which we can layer software and hardware upgrades. From a process perspective, we expect to purchase about 46% of SSI's shares in the next few days. This will enable us to obtain Board seats and give us a controlling interest in the company. Then we will file a cash tender offer to acquire the remaining shares and hopefully close the deal in the first quarter of our fiscal 2020. Now let's turn to Diagnostics, where revenues of $305.4 million increased a strong 5.1% in the quarter. Excluding sales from our divested Blood Screening business which declined in the quarter, Diagnostics revenue increased an even better 7.1%. Molecular remains the growth driver here based on the productivity of our R&D team which has now earned U.S. clearances in 11 consecutive quarters and the sophistication of our lab and physician-based sales teams. In the quarter, worldwide molecular sales of $170.9 million grew 11.7%, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth despite a challenging prior year comp. Internationally, molecular grew 22.1%, well into the double digits for the 12th time in 13 quarters. Although international is a small piece of our total molecular franchise, we are seeing very strong performance there. And in the U.S., although we already enjoy high market shares in key assay categories, molecular sales still grew 9.4%. This reflects how we work collaboratively with our customers especially our largest ones to drive volumes and better patient care in established testing categories. In terms of product, molecular growth was broad-based in the quarter as customers consolidated testing on our large installed base of fully automated Panther instruments. Sales of our largest Aptima women's health assays for chlamydia gonorrhea, HPV and trichomonas all increased solidly. In addition although sales of new Diagnostics products are still relatively small, they more than doubled in the quarter led by our quantitative viral load tests and by Panther Fusion. Moving on Cytology and perinatal sales were $120.3 million in the third quarter, a small increase of 1.3%. Cytology sales increased slightly all outside the United States while perinatal sales were flat. In the United States, growth in the cytology market remains challenged due to our high market shares and longer cervical cancer testing intervals. Elsewhere in Diagnostics revenue related to our divested Blood Screening business was higher than expected at $14.2 million although this decreased by 23.7% compared to last year. As a reminder, this revenue mainly reflects low-margin products and services under transition agreements we have with Grifols. We expect Blood Screening revenue will total about $10 million in the fourth quarter and decline further to about $30 million for our 2020 fiscal year. Before we discuss GYN Surgical let me mention our leadership transition in Diagnostics. As you probably know Tom West accepted a CEO position at another company in June. We are happy for Tom and even more excited that Kevin Thornal has succeeded him as President of our Diagnostics division. As many of you know, Kevin led our European Breast Health turnaround a few years ago and guided Cynosure through a difficult stabilization process. He has a great track record of strengthening businesses, so he will fit well with our already strong Diagnostics leadership team. The division is performing well today and we believe Kevin's fresh leadership will accelerate the progress we have already made especially in business development. Now let's shift gears and cover GYN Surgical where sales of $112.2 million increased 5.2%, our fastest growth in eight quarters. This continues a steady cadence of improvement under new leadership since the business bottomed in the first quarter of 2018. Thanks to a strengthening sales force. MyoSure continues to be a healthy grower and we have built on this foundation by introducing new related products such as our Fluent Fluid Management System and our Omni Hysteroscope. And we are excited that more new products are on the way based on increased efforts in both internal development and licensing. Now let's turn to Medical Aesthetics where sales of $85 million represented about 10% of consolidated revenue and declined 5.5%. Despite this decline we saw additional signs of improvement for the second consecutive quarter. Our U.S. sales force stabilized and posted its third consecutive quarter of sequential growth under the leadership of Eric Anderson who has now replaced Kevin as President of the division. And OUS sales grew at a low single-digit rate after four consecutive quarters of declines. So we still have a long way to go at Cynosure, we believe we are beginning to find our footing. To round out the revenue discussion briefly, skeletal sales of $24.4 million grew 9.8% based on solid growth of our DXA systems for bone density and body composition testing. So to wrap up, our third quarter results represent our fifth consecutive quarter of good performance. Building on our market leading brands in the United States especially in Breast Health and Diagnostics, we are expanding internationally, churning out new products from our revitalized R&D pipelines and effectively integrating tuck-in acquisitions while looking for more. Overall we are executing well, but know that we have many more opportunities still ahead of us, which gives us confidence in our future. Now let me turn the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to walk through the rest of our third quarter income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics then finish with our updated financial guidance for 2019 as well as the fourth quarter. Unless otherwise noted my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis in constant currency. As Steve described, we are pleased with our third quarter results as revenue of $852.4 million and EPS of $0.63 exceeded our guidance. We benefited from strong performance by our largest businesses Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics, as well as improved results in our Surgical division. Both operating and net margins improved, reversing recent trends. We also deployed capital in accordance with our strategic priorities by agreeing to acquire SuperSonic and by repurchasing $50 million of stock. Our overall performance has been very solid through three quarters of the fiscal year and as a result, we are tweaking our financial guidance upward despite an incremental foreign exchange headwind. With that introduction, let me start by reviewing our P&L for the third quarter. Gross margins of 61.6% decreased 100 basis points compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to the strong U.S. dollar, trade tariffs in China, product sales mix especially related to Cynosure's performance and increased service costs. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, however, gross margins did improve sequentially by about 60 basis points as some of the one-time headwinds we mentioned last quarter dissipated, but the FX headwind got worse. Looking ahead, we expect better margins in the fourth quarter due to improved product mix, absorption benefits, the ramp of new product sales and our ongoing cost reduction efforts. Moving on. Total operating expenses of $276.4 million decreased 0.9% in the third quarter. However, excluding Faxitron and Focal, operating expenses declined 3.9%, reflecting strong discipline -- expense discipline especially in G&A. But as Steve said we remain fully committed to funding internal innovation and our R&D pipeline has never been more productive than it is today. Based on improvements in the top-line and strong operating discipline, operating margin of 29.2% increased by 40 basis points in the third quarter. Operating margin also improved sequentially to our best level since the first quarter of 2018. Other expenses net totaled $28.8 million in the third quarter, 11.4% less than a year ago as benefits from our currency hedges outweighed higher interest expense. Given the strengthening U.S. dollar, we expect similar hedge gains in the fourth quarter. Our currency hedges will reset as we move into 2020, theoretically eliminating any gains if currency stay constant. Finally, net margin of 20.1% increased 80 basis points compared to the prior year period, our best result since the first quarter of 2017. In addition to better operating margins and lower other expenses, we also had a slightly lower effective tax rate. Overall our net profitability remains very healthy. All this led to non-GAAP net income of $171.6 million in the third quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.63, which exceeded our guidance. Now I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. In the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our stock for $50 million, helping reduce our shares outstanding and boosting EPS. As of quarter end, we had a little more than $210 million remaining on our buyback authorization. Since 2016 we have put our strong cash flows to work, buying back more than 24.6 million shares of stock for $926 million, which has been a great investment and use of our capital. This doesn't even include the cash we used to retire convertible debt that was in the money. As we cleaned up our balance sheet, we also lowered our overall leverage ratio, which stood at 2.5 times at the end of the third quarter. We remain comfortable around this level, recognizing that the ratio could fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and buyback activity. Finally, we generated $138 million of free cash flow in the third quarter. Our strongest cash flow enables us to simultaneously pursue tuck-in acquisitions, while also acting on our share repurchase authorization. Now I'd like to shift gears and discuss our non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and fourth quarter. As a reminder, our updated guidance does not include the impact of our pending acquisition of SuperSonic Imagine. Based on our good third quarter results, we are increasing our constant currency revenue guidance slightly and raising the low end of our EPS forecast. Let's start with revenue. As a reminder, we previously guided to sales of $3.325 billion to $3.345 billion, which represented constant currency growth of between 4.3% and 4.9%. Based on our third quarter results, we are increasing our revenue guidance to $3.335 billion to $3.350 billion, which includes approximately $50 million of revenue from our divested blood screening business. Based on recent exchange rates, our new revenue guidance translates into constant currency growth of 4.7% to 5.2%. This is better than our last forecast and much better than our initial 2019 guidance, which called for growth of 2.8% to 4.2%. For modeling purposes, let me remind you that U.S. dollar has strengthened materially compared to our prior fiscal year. In fact, based on recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency fluctuations will reduce reported revenue by roughly $36 million in fiscal 2019. This is an incremental headwind of more than $5 million relative to our previous guidance. Despite this, we feel confident about growth in our core businesses and our ability to control expenses. As a result, we are raising the low end of our EPS guidance slightly. We now expect EPS of $2.42 to $2.44 for the year, which represents reported growth of between 8.5% and 9.4%. This is better than our initial 2019 EPS guidance, which was $2.38 to $2.42, even as we have absorbed the net effect of a worsening currency headwind and made reinvestments for future growth. This updated full year guidance is based on diluted shares outstanding of about 272 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%. With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance implies revenue of $834 million to $849 million in the fourth quarter. Compared to the prior year period this reflects growth of 3.5% to 5.3% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, our guidance reflects revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.4%. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.64 to $0.66 in the fourth quarter, which implies very strong growth of between 10.3% and 13.8%. Obviously, this is higher quarterly EPS growth than earlier in the year just based on the timing of revenue and expenses. As a reminder, our fourth quarter of 2019 has one fewer selling day than the prior year period, although this occurred over the Independence Day holiday, so we don't expect a significant impact. Also recall that Medical Aesthetics revenue is always seasonally weaker in the summer months. And finally, as Steve mentioned we expect blood screening revenue to decline from the third quarter level. As you update your forecasts we encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance ranges, as we have tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate recent foreign exchange rates as well as potential upsides and downsides. Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter of 2019 with Molecular Diagnostics and the Breast Health driving solid growth and Surgical strengthening. These businesses along with our international franchises are well positioned to drive future growth given the strategies we have in place. Both operating and net margin improved in the quarter and we continue to put our strong cash flows to work through tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases. Based on all this we are raising our annual revenue and EPS guidance slightly. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, and then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : All right. We'll take our first question from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter here. Congratulations, Steve. And just two quick ones, Steve. Maybe one on \u2013 maybe I'll start with the Breast Health, right? This really was strong. I'm just curious on what drove this. CapEx environment seems to be really strong. So was this more of the strong CapEx environment that you're seeing, or you had some FDA regulation on dense breasts. Are you seeing some uplift from there? And maybe could you also comment on how the order book is shaping up on the Breast Health side? Steve MacMillan : Sure, Vijay. I think the capital \u2013 certainly capital spending looks pretty good in hospitals right now. We continue to feel good about that. I do think that 3D, it's hard to put an exact number on what the breast density legislation is, but we are certainly able to have conversations that nobody else can, with the customers as they're gearing up to make purchases. And just as a reminder for people, we are the only 3D that has an FDA indication approved for dense breasts. And as there's more and more legislation driving towards disclosing dense breasts \u2013 breast density, it clearly plays to our advantage. So I think we feel like we've been certainly winning and we're on the leading edge of the technology there. So it's just a good place to be and our team is continuing to get better and better, at really selling the overall value proposition that comes with the best product in the market. To your second piece on the order trends, we don't get too far ahead, but I would say orders continue to look good for us. Karleen Oberton : Yes. And I would just add kind of beyond the gantry activity in the capital environment, I think our teams are continuing to come up building that capability and selling the portfolio of products as well as continuing growth in our service revenue. Vijay Kumar : Just to add onto that Steve. If you piece in all the different elements execution has gotten better. It was good to see some of the laggards Aesthetics and GYN turn the corner. And you're layering on this up, tuck-in deals that you've done which will annualize next year. Are we now at a place where Hologic can lay claim to being a mid-single growth asset? Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Sure, Vijay. I think we feel really good. When you consider \u2013 Pete Valenti we are with him. Obviously, he's been running our Breast Health business for five years right now. He's reminding us that the first strategic plan inherited it showed the traditional old days of growth curve and it would have been a decelerating, or really a declining business in 2018, 2019. I want to get \u2013 we want to be careful not to get too far ahead of ourselves on exactly where we are. We want to just keep putting numbers on the board. I think candidly, we were trying to chase some numbers a few years ago, and I think we got a little ahead of ourselves trying to proclaim where we are. I think at the end of the day, let the numbers keep speaking for themselves, and getting back to strong execution in our markets, and I think we'll show where we fit there. So thank you. Vijay Kumar : Thanks, guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our next question from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Please go ahead. Chris Lin : Hey, good afternoon. This is Chris on for Doug today. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve in your prepared remarks you mentioned that customers are consolidating molecular diagnostics assays onto Panther and that it has been a driver of growth. Could you just elaborate a bit more on that comment? Specifically, are customers consolidating women's health and virology assays onto Panther? Steve MacMillan : Sure. It's bits of both. What \u2013 primarily, it's just continuing to expand our growing women's health assays. As we mentioned, we got 11 straight quarters of FDA clearances in the United States. And I'd say truthfully, it's probably a little bit more of still getting more women's health stuff as the women's health line is expanded and to some degree certainly the virology kicking-in. But yeah, I think the way to think about our Panthers and the assays it's sort of this wonderful gift that keeps giving every quarter. We keep placing more Panthers in the labs. And every quarter each Panther that we have is generally doing more revenue. So we have sort of a force multiplier here of more of an installed base and then more menu coming through. And it's a combination of more of the women's health plus some virals, and just really continuing to build. And that's what's driving \u2013 you got nine \u2013 almost 9.5% growth in the United States, where its strong market shares already. Karleen Oberton : Yeah. And I would just add to what Steve said the elements that he talked about the ability to add menu on the Panther, it's also the value proposition for our customers that as we expand our menu, they get more leverage out of the Panther. And I think that's \u2013 a lot of what we're seeing is the value that customers see in the Panther. Chris Lin : Okay. And can I just go back to revenue guidance? You beat fiscal Q3 revenue guidance by about $20 million, but you only increased full year guidance by about $7 million to $8 million. Looks like FX is an incremental $5 million headwind. So this would imply that you reduced underlying full year guidance by about $5 million to $10 million. So could you just help us bridge the revenue guidance a bit more? Thank you. Karleen Oberton : Yeah. And so I might just look at it a little different way. If you looked at our second half of the year guidance from our last guide, we're at the midpoint to where we are now. It has increased overall for the second half of the year, while absorbing the incremental FX. So, again, I think the original guidance at Q3 that we gave in prior quarter would have indicated extremely high fourth quarter. We're pleased with how Q3 went and pleased that overall we've raised the second half of the year revenue guide. Chris Lin : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Anthony in for Raj. So maybe just a couple on the SuperS deal and maybe just a little bit more detail on expected revenue contribution next year and maybe a little bit on the growth profile of that asset and just the underlying margin profile of that business as we move into fiscal 2020? And then I'll have a quick follow-up on Diagnostics. Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Sure Anthony. Until we close that deal, we're going to avoid getting too far into the details. But we think, generally they did about in the high $20-ish million in revenue in 2018 and it's growing at what looks to be a low double-digit rate. So as we consolidate that and ultimately once we close on the deal, we'll give a little more information. But I think as we're thinking about at the highest level, it'll drop in $30-ish plus million of revenue at some point. We don't have it -- we won't have it probably fully closed until our first quarter as we talked about, but feel really good about its underlying growth rate and frankly the technology itself. And as a big reminder most of their revenue right now is outside the United States. So it brings us nice revenue there and our U.S. sales force is chomping a bit to get their hands on it. So we think it'll be a clear double-digit grower of an exciting new product for us. Unidentified Analyst : That's very helpful. And just on Diagnostics. Maybe just a little bit on the share front. So certainly sounds that volumes are doing well on the Molecular side. But anything on share just when you consider a number of recent launches around competitors out there whether it be in Europe in the U.S.? Steve MacMillan : Yes. I think the way we think about share is our international molecular business grew 22%. Our U.S. business grew over 9%. I think we'll stack that up with pretty much anybody. And ergo I think we're probably growing faster than the market without knowing specific shares. Mike Watts : Yes. It's Mike, Anthony. I think despite those very high shares in most of the key categories, I think what the team has done a really good job of doing is working with our customers to drive underlying demand and drive testing to guidelines and those kind of things. So that's helped us grow the business even though the shares are already pretty high. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Mike Watts : Thanks Anthony. Operator : We'll now take the next question from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Steve GYN Surg you commented steady progress in U.S. Can you just touch on NovaSure and MyoSure? I didn't hear you break those out. Steve MacMillan : Sure Tycho. I think MyoSure continued to be really strong and I think we stopped giving the Invader piece. I think the way I think about it is MyoSure was still a clearly double-digit grower, feeling great about it. NovaSure is still declining in that probably high singles level. We'd like to be a little bit better. But overall love the trajectory of the business. Mike Watts : And as a reminder we've introduced some new products there as well between our new fluid management system which is called Fluent and the new Omni Hysteroscope. And those are clearly -- those are related to MyoSure and are clearly helping drive growth as well. Tycho Peterson : And then on SSI, a couple of things. You got the Clarius deal that you had before for distribution. Curious how those fit together? And then obviously their cart-based system gets used in a lot of markets vascular, gastroenterology other areas. So I'm curious about how you're thinking about some of those kind of nonmammography-based areas? Steve MacMillan : Sure. Our focus is clearly going to be just in the mammography space. So if there's opportunities beyond that we could always partner that or whatever with the technology, but our clear focus will be in the breast area. And I think it's compatible with Viera. So we'll now have both a portable as well as a cart-based option. And frankly, I think to a large degree the cart-based option is going to be the bigger drivers of revenue here. So I think we've been learning more and more about the space and excited to have the chance to really get a cart-based offering that we haven't had. Thanks Tycho. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thanks. Operator : We'll now take your next question from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon. Want to go back to the Breast Health segment, just one modeling. How much was the contribution from Focal and Faxitron in the quarter? Do you break that out? And was also curious the international commentary around Latin America. Just a little bit more color on that and whether do you think that's resolved going in the fourth quarter? Does the fourth quarter guidance assume that stays pressured? Karleen Oberton : Jack, it's Karleen. So I think from Focal and Faxitron I think we indicated they contributed just over $13 million of revenue in the quarter. When you think about international LatAm is clearly the smallest piece of the Breast Health business but it was down almost 50%. And while we've guided \u2013 well, our guidance assumes a little bit of improvement in Q4 for that business. That will be down as well year-over-year. And I think just in general international Breast Health, we did see some movement of orders from Q3 to Q4 as well as, again, in the prior year period we'd had some large tenders that obviously didn't repeat this year. Jack Meehan : Great. And then one more follow-up on Breast Health. If I look at the service revenue in the quarter just from the Q the $117 million it looks like that was up about 1% year-over-year. So that slowed down. Just curious if there was anything to call out related to that. And maybe just give us an update in terms of some of the software upgrades and service and just where you think you are in the cycle. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So, I think we -- I think the expectation on service growth is in line with what we see. I think one of the nuances here is as we place new gantries, we have the cycle with customers will go under warranties for a year period and we have a lapse in the service contract revenue until they re-up. So that low single-digit growth is kind of what we expect. Operator : We will now take our next question from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard : Thank you. A couple of -- for Karleen. Karleen, on gross margin was there any downside variance in the quarter besides foreign currency? And if so what was the driver? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I would say beyond the foreign currency and the tariffs, the other was mix and specifically in Cynosure. So if you think about Q3 last year was what I'd call the height of the women's health product from a comp perspective which those products had a higher gross margin portfolio profile than the rest of the Cynosure business. So I would say that was the second biggest driver and then obviously we mentioned some higher service costs. Dan Leonard : Okay. And I was specifically trying to focus on downside versus plan as opposed to year-over-year. Is it still the objective? I mean, you've previously thought gross margins would have been only slightly down year-on-year in 2019 and that looks like they'll be down well more than that. Could you address that variance and also talk about being able to defend the gross margin line going forward? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So, I think from our original guide and what we had talked about for margins, I think that one of the biggest drivers is the increasing strengthening U.S. dollar which has impacted the gross margin line I think coupled with what I've mentioned last quarter. So last quarter we had talked about a number of onetime items, but what is continuing here as well is some higher service costs that we do have teams focused on to improve. But I think what's also equally important is that when you look at our operating income margin and net margin have both improved despite the headwinds we're facing with gross margin which leads to our ability to have strong discipline in our operating expense to still drive results. Dan Leonard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Dan Macek-Alwell: Great. Thanks. This is Dan on for Bill. I appreciate your comments on utilization within Panther instruments. It sounds like you're working well with customers to drive that figure. How are you thinking about that going forward in terms of utilization? It sounds like it's a growing figure. Thanks. Mike Watts : Dan, it's Mike. Yes, we try to update that number formerly at the end of our fiscal year. So probably we won't give you a specific number. But I mean your intuition is right. I mean that's generally been growing kind of in the high single-digit range year-over-year that being Panther utilization per box. So there's some good progress there. Dan Macek-Alwell: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just another one on Molecular to follow up. That's another double-digit quarter. And then, how are you guys thinking about that growth rate heading into the fourth quarter and then maybe over the longer term? I know you've said high single digits, but it's been pretty consistently outperforming. So if you could just touch on that. Thanks you. Steve MacMillan : Yes. I think we continue to think about it as a high singles probably lower end of high singles and plan for that and try to deliver a little bit better certainly helps. But we wouldn't be ready to call it a long-term double-digit growth, especially with the competitive environment and everything else. But we feel like we're doing very well there. Dan Macek-Alwell: Okay. Great. Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Great. Thanks. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Thank you. Ivy Ma : Hi, this is Ivy Ma on for Derik today. Thank you for taking my question. So I have one on SSI and have a follow-up on Cynosure. So, I know SSI is targeting EBITDA breakeven for the year. Understand that you wanted to be more conservative and guided to slight dilutive for next year, so just wanted to see if there's any additional color or consideration there? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : When we bring it into us, we reported net income, not EBITDA. So on a -- while they may be breakeven on the EBITDA basis, they're losing money on an operating basis. So that's the difference there. And obviously in our hands... Karleen Oberton : Yes. I don't think we've changed strategically kind of investments or kind of spend habits that they had. It's just as Steve pointed out a different profitability metric. Mike Watts : I think Ivy, just to remind you, I think what we said in our original press release there that -- was the expectation would be I think less than 1% dilutive for next year or so. We think that's very manageable in the context of the overall P&L. Steve MacMillan : Yes. And we'll probably in a position when we give guidance for next year to be able to incorporate that in on the next call. Ivy Ma : And for Cynosure congrats on the launch for the new contouring product recently. Any updated thoughts on outlook for the segment for the rest of the year and next year? Thanks. A \u2013 Steve MacMillan : Go ahead, Karleen. Karleen Oberton : I was just going to say that, I think as we looked -- we're happy with the stabilization. Really pleased that we're able to launch the new products, although, I don't think they're going to be big meaningful drivers of growth that currently create some excitement with the sales force. I think as we exit the year, we expect the division to return to growth, but albeit on a much weaker comp. So feel good about where we're at right now. Ivy Ma : Great. Thank you. Operator : And I'll take your next question from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Mason Austen : HI. This is Mason on for David today. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to touch on Surgical. You have a new competitor coming to the market with Cerene. I was just wondering if you could talk about how you think about the competitive dynamics with the segment moving forward with NovaSure and in the next fiscal year. Thanks. A \u2013 Steve MacMillan : Sure, Mason. Yes. I think we continue to feel good about the direction and the results that we're generating. We've looked at the clinical package for Cerene. As you may know, there's a lot of questions around that company and business and a lot of stuff going on over there. So we just keep focusing on our customers on our innovation and feel good about where we're going. Mason Austen : Thanks. And on the Brevera supply constraints you referenced this as a weighing on interventional results into the quarter. I was just wondering if you could potentially break that out and potentially provide an update as to when you expect to be back to full supply. Thanks very much. A \u2013 Steve MacMillan : Yes. We're not going to get into -- the level of impact is fairly small in the grand scheme. But I think, as we've said, we probably really won't be back in the full supply until later on into 2021 -- or fiscal 2020 rather, end of our next fiscal year. Mason Austen : All right. Thanks very much. A \u2013 Steve MacMillan : Great. Operator : And I'll take your next question from Richard Newitter from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Jaime Morgan : This is Jaime on for Rich. A quick question. So I didn't think I heard you break out any of the subsegment directional commentary on growth within Medical Aesthetics. So I was wondering if you could provide any sort of commentary on the different trends between skin, body and women's health. A \u2013 Steve MacMillan : At the end of the day, we're not providing the breakouts per se, given the size of the business. But, overall, I'll tell you, skin was up nicely. Women's health was down significantly over last year, because that was little like 12 months ago, almost to the day when the FDA letter came out. So we were doing very well with the women's health line last year at this time and the body segment is down a bit. Jaime Morgan : Okay, great. And then, just within the U.S. you're saying that you saw some sequential improvement there. So just curious. You guys had mentioned some marketing initiatives that were launched at the beginning of last quarter. Just wondering if some of that is coming from the strength of those marketing initiatives. Thanks for talking my questions. A \u2013 Steve MacMillan : Yes. I think, it's coming from two things. We feel really good, particularly about the Brooke Shields campaign that we have on SculpSure. There's been a lot of positives on that. And the sales force has really hit a good spot now, where we've got a combination of some great seasoned veterans and frankly most of the leadership of the sales organization, are the long-term veterans of the company the Cynosure, pre before we acquired it supplemented out with a lot of great teams on the ground. So it's a combination really of the marketing and the teams in place and then really focused on bringing a pipeline of new products that'll start to kick in over next year. Operator : We will now take our last question from Dan Brennan from UBS. Please go ahead. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks. Thanks Steve, Karleen and Mike. I guess, I wanted to ask the first question on breast. If you don\u2019t mind, can you just walk us through a little bit about the strength that you're seeing there and kind of segment out kind of the contribution or how we should think about Genius versus the newer gantries' dimensions and profile? Just wondering what the runway is on each of those to sustain this type of growth rate. A \u2013 Steve MacMillan : Sure. I think, overall, really the 3Dimensions and 3D performance have by far become the bulk of the sale now. So the old days of dimensions 3,000 6,000 9,000, largely given way to the 3D Performance and the 3Dimensions still under the Genius banner. But I think the new products, both high end and a slightly more performance is slightly defeatured on the 3DPerformance, both providing us really good opportunities to both go high end and also the lower end with our customers. Karleen Oberton : And I would just add from a runaway perspective, I think, we've talked about the overall market penetration from 2D to 3D, as well as our own installed base would give us roughly 3,000 to 6,000 more gantries to convert to 3D and I'd say steady cadence of gantry placements since 2015 about 1,000 per year that gives us nice runway. Dan Brennan : Thanks for that. And then just one final one. Just on the M&A front. Sounds like tuck-ins are the kind of focus going forward. But just wondering Steve, just remind us to the extent like you were to see something bigger like what's your appetite in terms of size? And maybe any color on the pipeline as it stands today. Thanks a lot. A \u2013 Steve MacMillan : Sure Dan. I think we're -- while not a stated policy, we're generally thinking, okay, we're generating $600 million to $700 million of free cash a year. Probably not thinking about spending more than that in any given year on acquisition. I think it's kind of a good disciplinary. So that's not a formal policy never to be deviated from, but I think it should frame in kind of the thinking. And I think we're certainly hunting much more in a 100, a couple of hundred million kind of range versus anything that starts with a B. So thank you. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This is now -- this now concludes the Hologic's Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. Have a good evening.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. And welcome to the Hologic's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cody, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call. Mike Watts : Thank you, Cody. Good afternoon. And thanks for joining us for Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks today, and then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our Web site. We also will post our prepared remarks to our Web site shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through November 29th. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Steve MacMillan : Thank you, Mike. And good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, our sixth consecutive quarter of good consistent results. Total revenue came in very strong at $865.8 million, a 7.3% growth rate in constant currency that exceeded our guidance. Improving operating and net margins drove non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65, an increase of 12.1% and in-line with our expectations. We wrapped up fiscal 2019 with our best revenue growth of the year. This growth was balanced, with sales increasing in each of our divisions, both domestically and outside the United States. In addition to very good results in our largest businesses, Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics, we were excited by the continued strengthening of Surgical, which posted its best growth in 10 quarters. Before we discuss the quarterly details, let me step back and give a status report on the company as a whole since we're marking the end of our fiscal year. We have clearly made a lot of progress over the last six quarters. In the first half of fiscal 2018, our overall growth rate was about 2%, if you strip out the divested Blood Screening business and the inorganic benefits of Cynosure. We restructured our leadership team around that time. And by the second half of last year, growth had improved to the 4% range. And for the full year of fiscal 2019, growth was 5.7%, well ahead of our initial guidance as we added two tuck-in acquisitions to solid underlying organic growth of about 4%. This organic performance, which excludes currency movements, blood screening and Faxitron and Focal, is impressive when you consider that we operate in several flat or declining markets, where our leading market shares make it challenging to grow. In short, we had executed well over the last year and a half and expect to do the same in fiscal 2020. Now, let me break down our performance further by providing a brief snapshot of how we're doing each of our major franchises. In U.S. Breast Health, which grew 9.1% for all of 2019, we are using internal R&D and external acquisitions to build on an incredibly strong domestic leadership position in 3D Mammography. By leveraging our install base, we are creating a steadier, more diversified growth engine across the continuum of breast healthcare. In domestic diagnostics, which grew 4.5% for the full year, we are partnering with our customers to drive market growth and leveraging our install base of fully automated Panther instruments, with the broadest assay menu in the mid to high volume molecular space. In U.S. surgical, which grew 2.8% for the fiscal year, we have revitalized our sales force and our R&D engine to drive steadily improving growth. In domestic medical aesthetics, which declined 9.9% for all of 2019, we have stabilized our U.S. sales force as we await internally developed and externally licensed new products to drive growth. Outside the United States, where revenue grew 8.2% in 2019, we have transformed what was effectively a startup a few short years ago into a consistent growth driver, with much opportunity ahead for both revenue growth and profit improvement. With that introduction, let's discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail. Revenue of $865.8 million exceeded our guidance and grew robust 7.3%. Within this, the acquired Faxitron and Focal businesses contributed $14.6 million to revenue. We were off to a good start with these deals with low-teens growth for the full year on a pro forma basis. Excluding sales from our divested Blood Screening business, which increase in the fourth quarter revenue of $849.1 million grew 6.9% still our best overall growth rate of the year. In terms of geography, domestic sales of $656.2 million increase a very healthy 6.7% in the quarter. Excluding Blood Screening again, U.S. growth was 6.2%, accelerating for the fifth consecutive quarter. Outside the United States, sales of $209.6 million increased 9.2% in constant currency, a nice rebound compared to the third quarter. Now, let me provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. In our biggest division, Breast Health, our core 3D Mammography business remains rock solid and we are building on it with an increasingly diversified product portfolio that spans the continuum of breast healthcare. Based on internal R&D productivity and strategic acquisitions, we have established ourselves as the trusted experts in Breast Health. We offer innovative products that deliver better clinical outcomes for patients and workflows that make life easier for customers. Together, these translated to steadier, more predictable revenue. In the fourth quarter, underlying trends in Breast Health remained strong. Global sales totaled $342.6 million, an increase of 7.1% against the tough prior year comparable. In terms of geography, domestic Breast Health revenue grew a healthy 6.4%. Outside the United States, we were pleased to post sales growth of 9.4%, accelerating compared to the third quarter. In terms of breast sub segments, imaging sales grew 6.5% while interventional sales increased 10.2%, as we focused on selling our growing portfolio. Imaging benefited from about $10.4 million of Faxitron sales while Interventional included $4.2 million of Focal revenue. In Imaging, sales of our Genius 3D systems increased strongly, establishing a new quarterly record some eight years after the domestic launch life, an impressive accomplishment by our commercial teams. On a cumulative basis, we have shipped about 6,900 3D systems in the United States, giving us a tremendous install base onto which we can layer additional revenue streams. We have converted more than 70% of our installed base to 3D. Yet, there are still more than 5,000 Hologic and competitive 2D systems in the United States, providing us multiple years of conversion runway at our current pace, especially as we continue to gain market share. As in recent quarters, Imaging growth was driven by our new 3D performance and 3Dimensions gantries, demonstrating how innovative R&D is contributing to our growth strategy. Other new products, including Intelligent 2D, Clarity HD and SmartCurve, also added nicely to Imaging growth. We have a long-term opportunity to further enhance our existing 3D install base with upgrades like these, as well as the new artificial intelligence tools that we are developing and expect to launch this year. In Interventional, our fourth quarter results benefited from strong growth from biopsy disposables, which more than offset a headwind from lower Brevera capital sales due to the supply constraints we have previously discussed. Before I turn to Diagnostics, let me update you on our pending acquisition of SuperSonic Imagine, or SSI, a French innovator in cart-based ultrasound technology. As a reminder, this tuck-in deal leverages our existing call points and is expected to be accretive to our revenue growth rate, albeit with some slight dilution to EPS in the near-term. In early August, we acquired 46% of SSI's shares and have now opened a cash tender offer to purchase the rest of the company. Because we haven't finalized the acquisition yet, we recorded SSI's fourth quarter results under the equity method of accounting for investments. This means we booked no revenue or expense from SSI, but did record our share of their non-GAAP net loss, $1.8 million on a non-GAAP basis in other expense. We expect to close the deal by the end of our first fiscal quarter, and Karleen will tell you more about this. Now let's turn to diagnostics, where revenue of $306.8 million increased 7.1% in the fourth quarter. Excluding sales from the divested Blood Screening business, diagnostics revenue grew 6.1%, still a very strong performance. Molecular remains the growth driver here, based on the productivity of our R&D team, which achieves 19 global clearances in fiscal 2019 and the sophistication of our lab and physician based sales teams. In the fourth quarter, worldwide molecular sales of $172.1 million grew a very healthy 9.8%. Internationally, molecular grew 14.1%, well into the double-digit for the 13th time in last 14 quarters, against a very difficult prior year comp. And, in the U.S., although, we already enjoy higher market shares in key assay categories, molecular sales still grew 8.8%. This reflects how we work collaboratively with our customers to drive volumes and better patient care in established markets. Molecular growth was again broad based in the quarter, as customers consolidated testing on our large install base of fully automated Panther instruments. Sales of our largest Aptima women's health assays, including chlamydia gonorrhea, HPV and trichomonas, increased at an impressive high single-digit rate overall. Sales over many new products also added to growth, led by our quantitative viral load tests Panther Fusion and early contributions from our Aptima vaginosis assays. Panther has carved out a unique highly defensible leadership position in molecular diagnostics, just as our Genius 3D Mammography systems have in Breast Health. Over the course of 2019, our global install base of Panther's grew by more than 200, about the same amount as the year before. This brought our cumulative total to more than 1,700 units, 45% of which are outside the United States. Importantly, utilization of these instruments has continued to grow as new assays emerge from our R&D pipeline, and as we partner with customers to drive overall testing volume. Average revenue for Panther is now about $240,000 a year on a global basis, and grew at a high single-digit rate in fiscal 2019. Moving on, Cytology and Perinatal sales were $118 million in the fourth quarter, a small increase of 1%. Cytology sales increased slightly, all outside the United States, while Perinatal sales declined. decline. Domestic growth in the cytology market remains challenged due to our high market shares and longer cervical cancer testing intervals. Elsewhere in Diagnostics, revenue related to our divested blood screening business was higher than expected at $16.7 million, an increase of 29.7% compared to last year. As a reminder, this revenue reflects low-margin products and services under transition agreements with Grifols. So the outperformance here hurt our gross margin percentage for the quarter. Now let's turn to GYN Surgical, our most profitable division where growth has been consistently accelerating behind the re-energized sales force and a revitalized R&D pipeline. In the fourth quarter, sales of $114.5 million increased 7.3%, our fastest growth in 10 quarters. We want to spend a little time highlighting the tremendous progress we've made in surgical, under the leadership of Sean Doherty, who's been named division President a little more than two years ago. Under Sean's leadership, U.S. revenue growth has increased sequentially in six of the last seven quarters against progressively more difficult comps. Underpinning this performance, we have made significant changes in the talent, structure and incentives of our domestic sales team. And these changes are paying off. At the same time, our surgical business outside the United States, while still small, has been growing rapidly and we've only scratched the surface of this opportunity. From a product perspective MyoSure and NovaSure remain leaders in the fibroid removal and endometrial ablation categories, respectively. MyoSure remains a healthy grower with significant runway ahead as we launch line extensions and supporting products, and replace more antiquated methods. As for NovaSure, we believe our market share is stable, and in many cases, we are winning customers back, although, we need to slow category declines. Finally, new products have begun to contribute materially to surgical growth. Most notably, our Fluent Fluid Management System and our Omni Hysteroscope, and we just launched our Omni Lok cervical seal and new Definity cervical dilator. So like Breast Health, Surgical is becoming much more diverse, enabling us to better leverage a large and strengthening sales force and we intend to add more new products in the future through both internal development and acquisitions. Now let's turn to Medical Aesthetics where global sales of $76.9 million represented about 9% of consolidated revenue and increased 10.3%. As a reminder, we had an easy comparable in the prior year period as we booked a revenue reversal of $6.8 million associated with refunds and rebates of TempSure Vitalia in the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding this, Cynosure sales would have been basically flat, reflecting a business environment that hasn't changed much. Specifically, our skin-related products continue to do well, while our lasers for body contouring in woman's health continue to struggle a bit as we await new products, both in-licensed and internally developed, to drive future growth. To round out the revenue discussion briefly, skeletal sales of $25 million grew 3.7% based on growth of our DXA systems for bone density and body composition testing. To wrap up, our fourth quarter results represent our sixth consecutive quarter of strong execution. Building on our market leading brands and large installed bases in the United States, especially in Breast Health and Diagnostics, we are expanding international internationally, churning out new products from our revitalized R&D pipelines and effectively integrating tuck-in acquisitions, while looking for more. Now let me turn the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to walk through our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, and then finished with our initial financial guidance for 2020. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis in constant currency. As Steve described, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results, as revenue $865.8 million exceeded our guidance and EPS of $0.65 finished in line with our expectations. Our performance was balanced and strong with sales growth in each of our businesses, both domestically and internationally. In addition, operating and net margins improved as we continue to manage the business for leveraged profitable growth. With that introduction, let me start by reviewing our P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margins of 61.7% decreased slightly by 10 basis points compared to the prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to higher manufacturing costs, the stronger U.S. dollar, trade tariffs in China and product sales mix. However, it's worth noting that gross margins did improve sequentially for the third straight quarter and we expect this trend to continue in 2020. Total operating expenses of $279.3 million increased 5% in the fourth quarter. But excluding Faxitron and Focal, operating expenses increased just 2.7%, reflecting strong expense discipline, especially in G&A. We continue to balance growth investments with our goal to drive operating leverage, and our R&D pipeline has never been more productive than it is today. Based on improvements in the top line and strong operating discipline, operating margins of 29.4% increased 30 basis points. Operating margin also improved sequentially to our best level since the fourth quarter of 2017. Other expenses net totaled $33 million in the fourth quarter. As Steve explained, this line included our share of SSI results, specifically a loss of $1.8 million, which was not contemplated in our most recent guidance. Other expenses also benefited from gains from our currency hedges. As a reminder, these hedges reset back to zero in 2020, assuming currency stay flat. Finally, net margins of 20.2% increased 70 basis points compared to the prior year period, our best result since the third quarter of 2016. In addition to better operating margins, we had slightly lower effective tax rate, which effectively offset the loss from SSI. Overall, our net profitability remained very healthy. All this led to non-GAAP net income of $175 million in the fourth quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65, in line with our forecast. On a GAAP basis, we posted EPS of $0.15, lower than expected due to non-cash impairment charges, totaling $79.2 million related to Medical Aesthetics. As Steve noted, not much has changed in this business, but we've looked at these charges as part of our normal year end accounting process of reviewing long lived assets for impairment. Before we move on to our initial 2020 guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other key financial metrics. Our leverage ratio stood at 2.3 times at the end of the fourth quarter. We remain comfortable around this level, recognizing that the ratio could fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and buyback activity. The combination of strong profit growth and net debt improved our return on invested capital. As of year-end, ROIC was 13% on a trailing 12 month basis, an increase of 40 basis points over the prior year. Finally, in the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA improved to $277.7 million, an increase of 5.5%. Now, I'd like to discuss our initial non-GAAP financial guidance for fiscal 2020. Before I do, let me remind you that, as usual, there are several puts and takes in comparing 2020 to 2019. In terms of headwinds, revenues from our divested Blood Screening business is expected to decline significantly in 2020, and in foreign exchange rates at recent levels will be a drag on reported results of about $70 million, or roughly 50 basis points on the company overall. On the positive side, the acquisition of SuperSonic Imagine will represent a tailwind to reported revenue growth in 2020. Our guidance assumes that SSI's revenue and operating results will be consolidated into Hologic's financials at the beginning of the second quarter with revenues totaling $25 million to $30 million for the nine months. Current Street estimates include a wide range of timing scenarios. So hopefully, this guidance will help with modeling. For the first quarter, we have assumed our portion of SSI's loss, and as a reminder, SSI will be slightly diluted to non-GAAP EPS for the full year as we said when we announced the deal. As you update your forecast, we encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance ranges at this early stage as we've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate, both potential upsides and downsides. We anticipate that fiscal 2020 will be a good year for Hologic overall. Specifically, we anticipate constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 4.5%, in line with our improved organic performance in 2019. If we meet the high end of this range or exceed it, organic revenue growth should accelerate compared to 2019. Based on recent exchange rates, our top line guidance translates into reported growth rates between 2.5% and 3.9% and sales of $3.45 billion to $3.5 billion. We expect tuck-in acquisitions to continue being an important part of Hologic story going forward, and believe that additional deals will boost revenue in 2020. But as we think about our organic growth rate, I would point out that the blood screen headwind and the SSI tailwind that I previously discussed basically offset each other next year. Said another way, our organic growth rate should be similar to the constant currency growth rate of 3% to 4.5% in 2020, depending on how you model the various components. In terms of global division, our guidance contemplates similar growth rates in diagnostics, excluding Blood Screening, Breast and Surgical in the lower part of mid single-digits. We forecast less growth in Skeletal and Medical Aesthetics. Within these estimates, international revenue should grow in the high single-digits on a constant currency basis, in line with 2019, as we continue to see opportunities to drive sustainable growth in multiple markets across all our businesses. In Diagnostics, Molecular should continue to lead the charge in 2020 behind Panther Fusion and increased utilization of more than 15 women's health virology and respiratory assays. We anticipate $30 million to $35 million of revenue from the divested Blood Screening business, much lower than in 2019. In Breast Health, growth will be driven by multiple new products, accretive growth from Faxitron and Focal, our International business, three quarters of SSI results, and a large service annuity that now totaled well over $450 million annually. In Surgical, we expect growth from the continued expansion of MyoSure, the stabilization of NovaSure, the new products Steve discussed and International. In Medical Aesthetics, we expect growth from an increasingly productive sales force and new products, including TempSure Affirm and StimSure, which we've recently launched in Europe. In terms of profitability, we forecast gross margins to improve to 61.6% in the full year 2019. We expect better margins due to lower manufacturing cost, improved product mix, absorption benefits, the ramp of new product sales and our ongoing cost reduction efforts. These benefits will be partially offset by the expansion of our international business, which adds gross margin dollars but pressures our gross margin percentage. In terms of the quarter, we forecast that gross margin percentage will increase sequentially as the year goes on, based on the mixed benefits from newly launched products and higher overall revenues. In terms of operating expenses, we expect to continue showing strong leverage that helps drive healthy growth and operating margin percentage and ultimately EPS, even as we absorb an incremental $8 million in costs related to the new European MDR and IVDR regulations. Our guidance does not, however, include a re-instatement of the medical device excise tax, consistent with Street's current modeling and our expectations that it will be suspended again. Below the line, we expect other expenses net to be greater in fiscal than the roughly $130 million we recorded in 2019, primarily due to the absence of foreign currency hedge gains based on recent exchange rates. All this leads to forecasted earnings per share between $2.60 and $2.65 in 2020. This represents reported growth of between 7% and 9.1%, about double the rate of revenue growth, despite EPS headwind from currency and diminishing contributions from our divested Blood Screening business. We expect quarterly EPS to ramp up sequentially as the year progresses as it did in 2019. This guidance assumes a full-year tax rate of approximately 21.75%, flat to 2019 and diluted shares outstanding of about $272 million for the year. We also expect to continue generating robust free cash flow in 2020 in the mid $600 million range, excluding one-time items. Now let's cover guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect revenues of $835 million to $850 million in the quarter. This reflects constant currency growth of 1% to 3% and reported growth of 0.5% to 2.3%. As a reminder, our Breast Health business performed exceptionally in the first quarter of, 2019 which contributes to lower growth rate this year. And most years, Breast Health is seasonally weaker in the December quarter due to RSNA and the holidays. We forecast non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.59 to $0.61 in the first quarter, representing 1.7% to 5.2% growth on a reported basis. Before we open the call up for questions, let me conclude by saying our fourth quarter capped off as successful year for the company. Our largest businesses, Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics, led the way and Surgical continued to improve, driving revenue outperformance overall. We are encouraged by the continued strong commercial execution, the progress in our international franchises, the productivity of our R&D pipeline and the deals we have completed. We continue to exercise tight expense controls and strategically redeploy capital. Overall, we feel confident in our foundation heading into 2020, and have the leverage to deliver healthy revenue and EPS growth. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow up. Then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator instructions] And we'll hear first from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson : I'll start with guidance. Steve, you haven't really backed up the notion that you can be a mid single digit growth company. Obviously, you're getting a little bit below that. But given the kind of state of new product launches that you highlighted on the call, it seems like the bias would be maybe towards the higher end of guidance. So are there things that are actually going to be a little bit of a drag on growth as we think about next year. And then can you talk a little bit about which of the new product launches could be most incremental for next year? Steve MacMillan : Tycho, make no mistake, we feel really good about the zip code or getting into here in terms of organic growth. And certainly if you look in this most recent quarter, the number was well above where we've been. We just don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. It's kind of like we had a great first quarter to the year 13%. We're about to go against 13.5% comp in Breast Health and 11% in Molecular Diagnostics as we start the year. So we just don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. But don't mistake that for confidence in the underlying growth in the business, all the new products coming through, building quarter-upon-quarter Surgical bouncing back and getting stronger. So I think we feel very good. We're just this is coming out of the gates. It's certainly an uncertain global economy and everything else right now, there's no sense with us being too far ahead of ourselves. But don't mistake the guidance for how we feel about the business. Tycho Peterson : And then from the follow-up question on margin leverage, first of all, Karleen, you called that the tariffs hit on gross margins. I'm wondering if you can kind of quantify that. And as we think about 2020, just curious where you see the operating margin levers from your perspective? Karleen Oberton : So I think the first part of your question, Tycho, that we've quantified the China tariffs around $10 million annually as the headwind. And as we look at operating margins into 2020, we do expect leverage when we expect gross margins to improve, we expect higher revenue. And we do believe there's still opportunities in the middle of the P&L, especially as we integrate recent acquisitions to contribute to the margin growth. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Bill Quirk : So I guess first question, Steve, kind of bigger picture. I appreciate that that the capital exposure in the model is much less than it once was. And we're still hearing some pockets of potential capital softness, typically in the U.S. I'm just curious what your thoughts are at present? Steve MacMillan : I think as one of the few people who is running a company through the last major economic meltdown, as you know, [Bill Moyers] can be a little more cautious. And having said that, I think we feel better and better about the sustainability of our business. First off, we're so much less dependent on capital. Our diagnostics business, our surgical businesses, these are all recurring revenue and increasingly, our Breast Health business, between the gantries are a smaller and smaller portion of that. The service business is big, the additional product upgrades and those kinds of things that are smaller outlays, that can be funded out of operating expenses from the hospital budgets. I think we feel very, very good about the likelihood of continued growth within the businesses. And the fact that we've really transformed what the company looked like certainly going into the last downturn. Bill Quirk : And then as a follow-up, just following up rather on one of the diagnostic comments you made about the average utilization for Panther. Can you remind us where you are in percentage terms on average? I seem to recall that we were at something like 40% to 50% utilization on the systems. And then just briefly, kind of how high can that go? Is about 80% as good as it gets and then you're looking at a second system? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Sure. Not to get too granular with it, Bill. I would say in the U.S., we're certainly seeing numbers probably above that, and outside the U.S. still below that 40-ish percent number. So we still have a lot of runway ahead of us. And I think part of what we feel really good about is the continued placing of the Panthers. And the way we keep thinking about this is, keep placing more and more Panthers each year, another 200-ish last year. And then as you know, we're putting more and more menu onto each Panther, both domestically and internationally. So there's still a long way to go without us having to place an enormous amount of additional Panther. So a lot of the capital has already been made. That's been part of the gross margin issue even internationally as we've been placing more of the Panthers, and then that will recoup and it will be part of our margin expansion story in the years ahead. Karleen Oberton : Just to add to that, we look at certain key international markets. We only have one or two assays approved on the Panther. And as we peruse additional regulatory approvals, that will drive that increased utilization and the margin expansion that Steve mentioned. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan : I wanted to just focus on Diagnostics business. Obviously, pretty strong in molecular. I was just curious what you thought the runway was like for placements in the U.S. just based on the math around 1,700 in the overall 45% U.S., last year was 1,500 about 40 -- I'm sorry, that was international, 40% international was last year. It just seems like a lot of the placements were international over last year. So what's the runway for placements in U.S.? And maybe just more broadly, are you seeing any signs of consolidation amongst labs and how might that impact kind of the runway for Panther? Steve MacMillan : Jack, I think highest level we're probably in the 7th-ish inning in the United States, so a little earlier internationally. But I think still some significant opportunities, particularly with our largest customers. To your second point, lab consolidation, I think, that's an inevitable that we expect to continue to see. I think part where we feel great about the relationships that we've cultivated very deep relationships, obviously, with the largest players in the United States. We continue to work very closely with them to help both drive categories, volumes. And as they are really the consolidators, you know, we will benefit certainly from a volume standpoint going forth. Mike Watts : Jack, this is Mike. If I can just add one thing to that about the U.S. market. As Steve said, we have placed a lot of Panthers in the U.S. But we have, I think 15, 16 different tests approved on Panther domestically and only about half of our customers use more than two assays. So there's lots more room on board those systems to layer additional menu as it gets approved and it's already approved. Jack Meehan : And that was going to be my follow-up question is, I think I caught sexual health grew high single digits overall. So I wondering if you could just give us some mark-to-market in terms of what the virology versus Fusion slits, you know how just looking at 2019 what the total was for the year and what the balance within the molecular forecast assumes for those continuing to expand? Steve MacMillan : Yes, I mean that's a lot of detail there, Jack. We probably aren't going to go quite that far. I mean, I think we talked about virology a year ago being in the $20 million range. I don't think it quite double, but kind of close to that in the most recent 2019. Fusion is off to a good start, ramping off of base but that base is much smaller than that. Operator : Thank you. We will hear now from Ivy Maa with Bank of America. Ivy Maa : I guess just a broad question to start off. Can you talk more about the OUS trend? You're talking about investing more in OUS to extend the base, which might have some impact on the margin. So wanted to see what the opportunity there, what still out there untapped or still was the largest opportunities out there? Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Sure, Ivy, I think as we look at it, we see tremendous opportunities for all of our franchises in all of the major geographies. I think we really put more of a footprint down in Western Europe over the last few years where we now have -- we've gone direct in the Breast Health business, really in the UK and in Portugal, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, we still use dealers in most of the rest of Europe. But I think we've really built a competency there. Our Diagnostics business, we've gone more and more direct in those businesses. And Surgical, we're really just getting started. We're really only had a few countries in Europe and starting to build that business out as well. Shifting over Asia Pac, it's really a fairly similar story. The biggest underdevelopment, candidly, is Japan, that will take longer certainly to build out just given the fundamental dynamics, particularly in the Breast Health space there. But I think we're seeing very nice progress across the diagnostics business, including Cytology, and big opportunities in Breast Health in diagnostics and surgical certainly over time as well. So I think the way we think about it is, each year we're building a few more competencies and it's not going to be something you're going to see an inflection point, but consistently growing at an creative rate to the overall company. Karleen Oberton : I would just add some comments I made early. The opportunity is clearly expanding the assay menu in key countries internationally is going to drive growth. And as well as on the Breast Health business compared to the U.S., we are still converting from analog to 2D, not just 2D to 3D, so continued long runway for our key products. Ivy Maa : And just to follow up on that. Karleen, you talked about the margins, there're lot of puts and takes in the margin trends for next year. Can you provide any sort of constitution if you can for those myriad of sectors? Thanks. Karleen Oberton : So I think maybe you're referring to gross margins. There was a lot of puts and takes in the results, more takes I think than we expected. As we look to 2020, I think we're thinking about a range of gross margin expansion of about 50 basis points to 100 basis points. And as I talked about, we believe that will build as the year goes on in that from an operating margin perspective probably a little bit from that. Operator : Thank you. We'll hear now from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Chris Lin : This is Chris on for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to start with another question on Europe. Given the mixed macro backdrop in Europe, curious if you have seen any order softness, especially for the more capital oriented businesses? Steve MacMillan : We are not seeing any softness in Europe at the moment. I'm always a little nervous between Brexit, between everything else you have going on there, but we've been planning, and preparing. And I think for us we just continue to feel like our teams are getting stronger and stronger there. So feel good about our outlook. And really, I can't tell you how excited we are by our team in Europe. They have just come so far in the last few years. Chris Lin : And then maybe a question on Breast Health, I think you've been tracking 250 to 300 placements in the U.S. Sounds like maybe it was above down in Q4. Maybe just help us think about the right way to model the gantry placements in 2020 for U.S. Steve MacMillan : I think, we see it pretty much in that range. And we go back to four years ago or so when we said we were intent on breaking the cycle, and the job Pete Valenti and our U.S. team has done has been truly breakthrough and breaking that cycle. And I think what we've gotten into is much more of a steady cadence of replacement cycle that we had articulated we saw coming years ago, and it was our attempt to doing. So I think it's kind of settling into that range, which works out pretty well because the positive for that is it still gives us years ahead, I think everybody can see from the MQSA data that's available. We're clearly gaining far more in the competitive set than just upgrading our -- so I think still gives us years of runway ahead of us here, plus then being able to go back and get additional revenue from mining the install base further. But I think that's a rough way to think about it. Operator : Thank you. We'll now move on to next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Luke] on for the Doc. Just quick on Breast Health, so you guys had a great quarter there. And just thinking about it and as just talked about the place coming in a bit ahead and the overall macro uncertainty in the 2020. Do you guys see any pull forwards there on the CapEx side? Steve MacMillan : We have not, Luke. I think we kind of wondered about that a little bit in our fiscal first quarter of last year when Breast Health was really strong, but haven't really seen much to that effect at this point in time. Unidentified Analyst : And then I guess Cynosure, the next one, the Aesthetics business, returning to flat to growth ex the items in '18. So the outlook in there for '20 you guys are expecting that to kind of accelerate. How should we think about that in Q1? And is that something that's going to build over the quarters, or should that be pretty stable? Steve MacMillan : Keep the expectations down there. I think it'll build over the year because of the way the product pipeline is shaping up. We've got some things coming that probably won't quite hit in our fiscal first quarter, but should hopefully start to hit as we go into frankly the new calendar year. So I think we feel certainly better about the build on that business through the year. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Mason Austen : This is Mason on for David today, thanks for taking my question. You referenced stabilization of NovaSure in fiscal '20. Does that mean you're expecting this business to grow next year? And any updates on the competitive environment you can provide? Steve MacMillan : We're not declaring that we see that business, that NovaSure itself growing necessarily next year. We do feel great about the trajectory of the surgical business. Mason Austen : And your share count guidance doesn't incorporate any significant amount of buybacks, it looks like. But over the past couple of years, you've repurchased about 5 million to 7 million shares a year. Does this mean we should signal an uptick in M&A activity this year, or how should we think about capital deployment balancing? Thank you. Karleen Oberton : So I don't think anything's changed capital deployment strategy really between tuck-in M&A and share repurchase. I think from a guidance perspective, we just assumed a minimal share repurchase to manage dilution. As we just sit here today it's early and where the deal flow will play out. Operator : Thank you. We'll hear now from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Q - Anthony Petrone : This is Anthony for Raj. Just quick one on guidance and then a couple on Breast Health. Just on guidance, SuperSonic image SSI. I'm just wondering what's baked in there for 2020 at the guidance line and just follow up on Brest Health? Thanks. Karleen Oberton : Sure, Anthony, this is Karleen. So what we've said is as you know, we don't own a 100% of that today. We're tender offer process. So what our guidance assumes is that we will have revenue from SSI for the three quarters Q2 to Q4 in a range of $25 million to $30 million. We also assume that for Q1 we'll have our portion of their loss as well in Q1, but no revenue or expenses. Anthony Petrone : And just on Breast Health. Just wondering if there is an update on the FDA proposal around dense breast screening. Just when do you think the timing would be for final rule? And what do you think really that means for 2020 within Breast Health should the final rule call for more imaging robust imaging and screening for dense breast patients? Thanks again. Steve MacMillan : Sure Anthony. I'm probably owed for my lifetime on exactly predicting those kind of things out of FDA. I think what we do feel great about is what we control, which is we are the only 3D with the dense breasts indication, that is helping us when new business all of the time as people see that we're the ones that have that. Whether that guideline comes through from FDA in 2020 or not, exactly when it comes through, we don't see it as having necessarily a material uptick in our business, other than a further reinforcement of where the business is going. Mike Watts : And as a reminder, Anthony, that's been going on at the state level in a bunch of states for quite some time, so that contributes to what we're seeing as well. Steve MacMillan : It's clearly a net positive for us. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair Andrew Brackmann : This is actually Andrew Brackmann on for Brian. Brian wanted to be on the call, Steve, but he's out celebrating Bears win over the Eagles in the second half of that game. Maybe just on\u2026 Steve MacMillan : I thought Brian was actually going to be at the open tryouts at the Bears that they're having. Andrew Brackmann : His leg's not too good. I heard they need a kicker. Steve MacMillan : Well, then he can math every other kickers. All right. Back to our regular scheduled program\u2026 Andrew Brackmann : Yes, exactly. On Breast Health, Steve, you mentioned the artificial intelligence product sort of rolling out through 2020. Any additional detail you can provide on what sort of impact that might have this year and then sort of the lever you think it can provide to the company over the next several years? Steve MacMillan : Sure. I think it will be less in terms of meaningful acceleration or anything like that. I'd just be more of the products where we're starting to sell, like Clarity HD, our SmartCurve paddle we were able to start to monetize additional software into the gantries and into our sales. But over time, we think it's going to help establish that much more of a moat around our business by being the leaders to leverage the largest base install base in the business. So I don't think you'll be able to meaningfully break out that AI products are going to add ex million of growth, but they will start to dribble in here later on in 2020 and then start to contribute more in 2021 and beyond. Andrew Brackmann : And then just a clean-up question on the Brevera issue, I may have missed it. But any update on when that when that might be behind you guys? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : I think it'll likely be later this year. Our expectation is we will be back on the market with new capital, probably in our fiscal fourth quarter. So we should be there so. so, give Brian our best. Operator :  [Operator instructions] We'll now hear from Dan Brennan with UBS. Dan Brennan : I just wanted to ask a question first, Steve, on molecular. So what's baked in for 2020 growth? Is the high single digit consumable sustainable? And can you comment on kind of the competitive dynamics in that market? Steve MacMillan : I think as we think about the growth rate for molecular next year, probably smart to think about it is in the mid singles and then gaining pushing upwards towards high singles. Certainly, we're going to be going against some really tough comps, especially the first three quarters this year against global double digit numbers. So I think it will still be very strong growth in that space. I think for the competitive environment, we feel pretty good that we continue to innovate. And as we are rolling out more and more assays, that business should certainly be good. So we've guided our overall diagnostics businesses, as Karleen said, probably in at least the low mid single digits. So Molecular will clearly be leading above that. Dan Brennan : And then maybe to follow up just on M&A, the tuck-in strategy has been working well. It sounds like there will be more to come. So can you just give us some color on the appetite to maybe do anything bigger, kind of, how should we think about kind of the level of maybe the size of deals that we should expect going forward now that you've successfully executed a bunch of these? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Sure Dan. Actually really glad you asked that, because probably what's been under appreciated is, we've really shifted from a, what's been a corporate led business development strategy for what had been most of the 2000s and frankly up, even up to the Cynosure deal. But over the last few years, we've really built the divisional lead tuck-in capabilities. And I think we're just starting to really see what we'll be able to do there. In terms of magnitude, would not expect us to exceed, for example, our annual cash flow in terms of rough amount of deals. So, I think we're definitely in the tuck-in mode. There will certainly probably be a few that could be bigger than $100-ish million deals that we've done to-date, but nothing that's going to blow the mind or anything. I think we like really frankly being able to both do some acquisitions and do some stock buybacks within each year. And while not a formal policy, it's something we've discussed quite a bit as a management team and our board of really being able to use the natural cash flow that we have each year as opposed to needing to lever up or take on something more. And I think we've now seen there's more opportunities within our core businesses, and things that we're excited by. So thank you. Mike Watts : Cody, I think about that and that's about all the time that we have. So thanks everybody for your time on the call today, and we will talk to you all soon. Operator : Thank you. That concludes Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. Have a good evening.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Justin, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Michael Watts : Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through February 21. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those that are referenced in the safe harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue, which we are defining as constant currency revenue less the divested Blood Screening and Cynosure businesses as well as the acquired SuperSonic Imagine business. We hope that our discussion of organic revenue in this call will simplify a complex quarter and help you focus on the parts of our business that matter most. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our strong financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. But before we get into those details, let me start by saying that it's an exciting time for the company and for our shareholders. Now that the divestiture of Cynosure is behind us, we're able to double down on what we do best : helping women and their families live healthier lives through early detection and treatment of disease. Along those lines, at the recent JPMorgan conference, it was exciting to reintroduce ourselves to investors as a unique asset in women's health. Now with a simpler story, minus the overhang of Medical Aesthetics, shareholders can focus on the significant positive changes that have occurred in each of our businesses over the last couple of years. When you do, we think you'll find a company with a broad portfolio of market-leading products for women's health; a company that, over the last 6 years, has grown the top line at mid- single-digit rate and leveraged that into low double-digit growth on the bottom line; a company where each business has strengthened significantly since the first half of 2018, positioning us to drive faster organic revenue growth and better margins in 2020; and a company that is focused on redeploying its strong cash flow more aggressively into growth-accretive tuck-in acquisitions as well as returning cash to our shareholders via stock buybacks. I'm proud to say that for the first time since I joined Hologic, all our domestic divisions as well as our international regions are performing well at the same time, and behind the scenes, that's because our corporate and divisional leadership teams have never been stronger than they are today. With that introduction, let me turn to our first quarter results, which represent our seventh consecutive quarter of solid, consistent performance. Total revenue finished slightly above the high end of our guidance at $850.5 million. This was only 2.8% growth, but it's important to break down the components, as Mike said. He defined organic revenue, which excludes the divested Blood Screening and Medical Aesthetics businesses as well as some earlier-than-expected revenue from SuperSonic Imagine this quarter. So organically, we significantly outperformed expectations, growing 4.6% against our toughest comparable of the year. And this 4.6% compares favorably to our last quarterly guidance, which called for growth of 1.2% to 3%. In terms of the bottom line, we were pleased to hit the high end of our guidance range with EPS of $0.61 in the first quarter, even while absorbing a much worse-than-expected loss from Cynosure. So we are off to a good start in fiscal 2020, with all our divisions and regions showing solid performance. We are particularly excited about our Surgical division, which led the way with 10.2% growth in the quarter; and our Diagnostics business, which outperformed with 6.5% growth, excluding Blood. In terms of geography, domestic sales of $632.7 million increased 1.8% in the first quarter but 3.2% on an organic basis. Outside the United States, sales of $217.8 million increased 6%. But excluding acquisitions and divestitures again, revenue increased 9.2% organically, reflecting the strong foundations we have built for sustainable international growth. Core U.S. sales have grown at a low double-digit rate in each of the last 3 years, and we're well positioned to maintain that pace in the balance of 2020. Now let me provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. In our biggest division, Breast Health, our core 3D mammography business remains rock solid, and we are building on it with an increasingly diversified product portfolio that spans the continuum of breast health care. As we said at JPMorgan, we have overhauled our sales talent, structure and process to help key account managers sell a growing product portfolio more strategically. And this has led to a more diverse, consistent revenue growth. In the first quarter, underlying trends in Breast Health remained solid. Though consistent with our guidance, growth was slower due to a very difficult prior year comparable when worldwide sales grew more than 13%. Against this, global Breast Health sales totaled $331.1 million this quarter and increased 2.4%. Excluding $6.1 million of sales from SuperSonic Imagine, which was not included in our last guidance, global growth was 0.5%. In terms of geography, domestic Breast Health revenue finished in line with our expectations, with growth of 1.5%. OUS sales increased 5.5% in total but decreased 1.4% without SSI against a very challenging 16.1% comparable in the prior year period. We do expect OUS growth rates to rebound strongly in the balance of the year as the business grows and the comps ease. In terms of the breast subsegments, imaging sales grew 2.4%, benefiting from the SSI revenue I mentioned earlier, while interventional sales increased 2.6%. In imaging, sales of our Genius 3D Mammography systems remain steady driven by our new 3Dimensions and 3D Performance gantries. As we said in San Francisco, we have sold more than 1,000 gantries a year in the United States for each of the last 5 years, a remarkably durable performance that has defied expectations of a rapid drop-off in sales. Not only have we been converting our own 2D units to 3D, we have been gaining a much higher share of competitive conversions than anticipated. This market leadership position provides a solid foundation for divisional growth and a platform onto which we can add new products and strengthen our strategic advantages. In interventional, our first quarter results benefited from strong growth in biopsy disposables as our account managers focus on selling our entire portfolio. However, this was largely offset by a headwind from lower Brevera capital sales, which peaked in the first quarter of 2019 before we began limiting supply. We expect the Brevera headwind to be less onerous in the second and third quarters then flip to a tailwind in the fourth quarter when we begin selling capital again. Our new breast surgery franchise, which consists of the acquired Faxitron and Focal brands plus some legacy Hologic products, also continues to perform very well, with growth in the low teens in the quarter. We're pleased to see our strategic rationale for these division-led tuck-in acquisitions playing out as we accelerate growth by coupling clinically differentiated products with Hologic's commercial infrastructure. And we are equally excited about our acquisition of SuperSonic Imagine, or SSI, during the first quarter. As a reminder, SSI is a French innovator in cart-based ultrasound technology, which is used across the continuum of breast health care. Integration is off to a good start, and we continue to believe that the business will be accretive to our revenue growth rate, albeit with some slight dilution to EPS in the near term. We are especially excited about the opportunity in the United States, where SSI had a very limited sales presence, but will now be able to benefit from our commercial infrastructure and relationships with key customers. Now let's turn to Diagnostics, where we have upgraded our talent and aligned our commercial structure to help lab customers of all sizes grow their business. In the first quarter, total revenue of $311.5 million increased 5.5%. Excluding sales from the divested Blood Screening business, Diagnostics revenue grew 6.5%, an even stronger performance. The growth driver here remains Molecular, where we're placing more Panthers with more assay menu in more countries. This has led to strong increases in consumable sales and consistent revenue growth. In the first quarter, for example, worldwide Molecular sales of $178.5 million grew a robust 9% against a challenging prior year comparable. International Molecular continues to be a standout in both the speed and consistency of growth. OUS Molecular sales increased 22.2%, well into the double digits for the 14th time in 15 quarters. Growth was led by our core women's health tests, our viral load assays, with a growing contribution from HIV in Africa and Panther Fusion.  And in the U.S., although we already enjoy high market shares in key assay categories, Molecular sales still grew 6%. This reflects how we work collaboratively with our customers to drive volumes and better patient care in established markets. Domestic growth was again broad-based as customers consolidated testing on our large installed base of Panther instruments. As we showed at JPMorgan, we have shipped more than 200 Panthers globally in each of the last 5 years, fueling a very consistent, profitable razor-blade business model. In the first quarter, our legacy women's health assays for chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV and Trichomonas drove the growth, with our new vaginosis test, Panther Fusion, and our viral load assays contributing as well. Moving on, we were also pleased that Cytology & Perinatal sales of $121 million grew by 3.1% in the quarter, admittedly versus a soft prior year comp. Perinatal sales were flat, so the growth came from our Thinprep cytology franchise. Domestic sales were down slightly, consistent with recent trends, but OUS sales grew solidly, in part, reflecting the early phase of Germany's decision to adopt co-testing screening for HPV and PAP as the standard of care to minimize cervical cancer risk. To wrap up Diagnostics, revenue related to our divested Blood Screening business was slightly higher than expected at $12 million but declined by 15.5%. As a reminder, this revenue reflects low-margin products and services under transition agreements with Grifols and is excluded from our organic results. Now let's turn to GYN Surgical, our most profitable division on a percentage basis, where best-in-class products, new leadership, new commercial models and new product launches have been consistently accelerating growth for 2-plus years. In the first quarter specifically, sales of $119.1 million increased 10.2%, our fastest growth in 11 quarters. Surgical growth was driven by 3 main factors. First, core MyoSure continues to perform well, with mid-teens growth in the quarter as we expand the market for fibroid removal while gaining share. Second, although the domestic endometrial ablation market continues to contract, NovaSure is stabilizing thanks to renewed focus by our commercial teams. NovaSure was down low single digits in the quarter, an improvement compared to recent periods. We are pleased with the number of competitive wins we are seeing for NovaSure and ended the first quarter with more NovaSure customers in the United States than we started with. Third, new products are growing rapidly, although they still represent less than 10% of divisional revenue. Our Fluent Fluid Management System is our best-selling new Surgical product thus far, with more innovations emerging from our development efforts. And fourth, although international represents less than 20% of Surgical sales, it is growing rapidly, 19.6% in the first quarter. And we've only scratched the surface of this opportunity. To round out the revenue discussion, Skeletal sales of $23.5 million grew 11.4%, our best performance since the fourth quarter of 2017, based on strong growth of our DEXA systems. We're pleased to see the top college and professional sports teams are adopting DEXA technology for body composition testing and that our products will once again be used to assess football players participating in the NFL draft combine. Before we turn the call over to Karleen, let me just close our Medical Aesthetics chapter by saying that we are pleased to have completed the divestiture at the end of December. Cynosure sales in the first quarter were clearly much weaker than expected across the board. And as I mentioned earlier, the business was a significant drag on profitability as well. In terms of our business development strategy moving ahead, we look forward to pursuing more of the smaller division-led deals that have been working well for us. Net, we feel really good about the businesses we're currently in and don't see a need to add a fourth leg to our strategy given the many opportunities for tuck-ins that leverage our existing commercial channels. So in conclusion, it's an exciting time for the company and our shareholders. We are pleased to report our seventh consecutive quarter of strong execution, with 4.6% organic growth against our toughest comparable of the year. Our Surgical and Molecular Diagnostics businesses stood out this quarter, aided by strong international growth. But Breast Health is also performing well, with a multitude of opportunities still ahead. The efforts we have made over the last few years to strengthen capabilities and accelerate growth are paying off across the company, and we are supplementing these efforts with smart capital deployment that is focused on tuck-in acquisitions and share buybacks. Now let me turn the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to walk through the rest of our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, then finish with our updated financial guidance for 2020 as well as for the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis in constant currency. As Steve described, we are pleased with our first quarter results as organic revenue growth of 4.6% drove sales of $850.5 million, which slightly exceeded our guidance range. In addition, EPS of $0.61 finished at the top end of our guidance despite significant underperformance from the divested Medical Aesthetics business. We also executed on a $205 million accelerated share repurchase program following the Cynosure announcement and bought back an additional $81 million worth of shares on the open market. And our Board has authorized an additional $500 million repurchase program beginning in the third quarter. For all these reasons, fiscal 2020 is off to a great start, and we are raising our guidance for organic revenue growth and EPS accordingly. I'll discuss that more in a minute. But before I do, let me start by reviewing our P&L for the first quarter. Gross margins of 61.6% decreased 60 basis points compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to the disappointing sales in the divested Cynosure business, product and geographic sales mix and the stronger U.S. dollar. Total operating expenses of $289.3 million increased 5.3% in the first quarter or 4.1% if you exclude SSI's expenses. This increase was driven mainly by higher G&A costs associated with our deferred compensation plan, in which the associated liability is mark-to-market, resulting in higher expense. It's important to note, however, that we hedge this exposure. So most of this expense is offset by a benefit below the line in other income. In addition, research and development expenses increased as we continue to balance growth investments with our goal to drive operating leverage. Based on these increases in operating expenses, operating margin of 27.5% decreased 170 basis points. However, given the deferred compensation dynamic that I just discussed and the benefit in other income, it's probably more appropriate to focus on net margins of 19.3%, which increased 40 basis points despite the Cynosure headwind. Overall, our profitability remains very healthy. All of this led to non-GAAP net income of $164.1 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.61, at the top end of our guidance range, despite absorbing the Cynosure loss. Cynosure ended up costing us more than $0.02 in the quarter, net of the fixed overhead cost that, that division absorbed. Before we cover our revised 2020 guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Our leverage ratio stood at 2.5x at the end of the first quarter as we used cash to acquire SuperSonic Imagine and buy back shares. We remain comfortable with a leverage ratio between 2.5 and 3x, recognizing that this could fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and buyback activity. Moving on, ROIC was 12.3% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 10 basis points over the prior year. Finally, adjusted EBITDA of $261.9 million increased slightly compared to the prior year. Now I'd like to shift gears and discuss our non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and second quarter. We are updating our full year guidance based on our good first quarter results and to account for the divestiture of Cynosure. At the high -- at a high level, we are raising our organic constant currency revenue guidance as well as our EPS forecast. Let's start with revenue. As a reminder, we previously guided to reported sales of $3.45 billion to $3.5 billion, which represented constant currency growth of between 3% and 4.5%. This original guidance contemplated an equivalent organic growth rate of 3% to 4.5% since the forecast from the acquired SSI business and the divested Blood Screening business basically offset each other. Based on our strong first quarter results in our core businesses, the divestiture of Cynosure and an updated currency headwind of $10 million, we are increasing our organic revenue growth guidance to a range of 4% to 5%. If we meet or exceed the middle of this range, organic revenue growth would accelerate compared to 2019, as Steve said in his introduction. Now let me transition to reported growth guidance for the full year. We now expect revenue of $30 million to $35 million from SSI and $35 million to $40 million from Blood Screening. This helps us build up to a total reported revenue range of $3.238 billion to $3.268 billion. This range equates to constant currency decline of 3.5% to 2.6% or a reported decline of 3.8% to 2.9%. These declines are driven by the absence of Cynosure revenue in the balance of the year. Based on the improved revenue performance in our core businesses, we expect to invest additional resources in future growth. But at the same time, our buyback activities enable us to offset these additional investments while still driving leverage bottom line growth. So despite absorbing the $0.02 Cynosure loss in the first quarter, we are increasing our full year EPS guidance to a range of $2.63 to $2.67 a share, which represents growth between 8.2% and 9.9%. This full updated -- full year updated guidance is based on diluted shares outstanding of 268 million to 269 million for the full year, which reflects progress on our buyback program and an effective tax rate of approximately 21.75%, the same as our original guidance. Now let's turn to guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect organic revenue growth of 3.4% to 4.8%. This organic growth, combined with the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, leads to a total revenue range of $770 million to $780 million for the quarter. This equates to constant currency decline of 5.4% to 4.2% and a reported decline of between 5.9% and 4.7%. Again, these declines are due to the absence of Cynosure revenue compared to the prior year period. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.61 to $0.63 in the second quarter. This implies growth rates of between 5.2% and 8.6% continuing to outpace revenue. Let me point out that this EPS range incorporates improved gross margins of 62% to 63% in the second quarter, mainly reflecting benefits from the Cynosure divestiture. I'd also like to point out that while other expenses net were $24.8 million in the first quarter, we expect these expenses to increase by more than $5 million sequentially in the second quarter as we don't forecast the benefits we saw in the first quarter to recur. As you update your forecast, let me remind you that we're raising our guidance materially this quarter, so we would encourage you to model to the middle of our guidance range. It's still early in the year, and we've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying we are pleased with how we started 2020. We feel great about our core businesses and now raising our organic growth rate guidance accordingly. We are encouraged by continued strong commercial execution, the progress in our international franchises, the productivity of our R&D pipeline and the deals we have completed. And we are excited about the opportunity to strategically redeploy capital going forward through division-led business development and share buybacks. Overall, we believe we have multiple levers to deliver healthy organic growth -- revenue growth and EPS growth in 2020. With that, I will ask you to operator to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go ahead and take the first question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Maybe just on Cynosure in the wake of the divestiture. Obviously, this was a big focus or distraction, whatever you want to call it, for the investor base. But how much in the divestiture allow for an increased focus internally? Given things are segmented out, did it not consume too much mind share? Or do you feel like there's not going to be a renewed focus on the core business, particularly in areas like internationally, your businesses seem to be run a little closer to each other? Did Cyno get kind of a disproportionate amount of attention there? Or do you feel like there's going to be an increase especially even outside of the removal on the overall growth number? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. Patrick, your -- the last part of your question is extra insightful, that in the U.S., there was -- really, the core businesses were not as distracted, but clearly, Karleen, me and Mike, the whole senior management team was. Internationally, to your point, I think what we're really excited about is the international folks being able to really double down on the 3 core businesses because like anything, they were probably spending a disproportionate amount of time and energy dealing with customer issues, service issues, whatever it might be on the Cynosure business. And I will tell you, if you talk to our head of Asia Pac, our head of the European area and then you get into the country leaders and everything else, they, I think, are very excited about the opportunities ahead. And I think we've been making very nice progress in the last few years internationally, but this is probably the best news they can get out of it. And it makes us more excited about the opportunities ahead. Karleen Oberton : And Patrick, this is Karleen. The only thing I would also add is that it kind of shows such a back-end-loaded revenue in the quarter. Really, this divesture also gives us increased confidence in our forecasting ability and ability to reinvest when we see upside. So I think it's a benefit there though as well. Operator : And our next question will come from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Chris Lin : This is Chris on for Doug today. Maybe just to follow up on the Cynosure question a bit. Michael Watts : Hey, Chris, before you get started, just for the -- this is Mike. Just for the operator, it's fine to let folks ask a second follow-up question, just to be clear. So I just wanted to make that point that you're welcome to ask a follow-up. Sorry about that. Chris Lin : Go ahead. Okay. So could you just help us bridge the organic revenue growth guidance as it relates to Cynosure in the core business? I guess, said differently, to what extent was organic revenue growth guidance increased due to the removal of Cynosure from results? Stephen MacMillan : There was a bit of both. I think at the -- truthfully, at the start of the year, Cynosure, we thought, was going to grow roughly in line with the rest of the businesses. Now clearly, that did not happen in the first quarter because of the divestiture and the announcement. So it was a pretty ugly quarter. But I think if you really look at it, at the end of the day, the revised guidance upward is also more conviction and confidence in our core businesses. So it's really more about the additional confidence we have in our core businesses. We didn't really see Cyno being a drag. Now probably, it would have been, but it's -- clearly, we feel better and better about each of the 3 other businesses. Karleen Oberton : Yes. And I think to the point that Steve made earlier, internationally, is it's a significant piece of the upward take in that guidance. Chris Lin : Okay. And then for a follow-up question, has the severe flu season benefited your Panther Fusion respiratory assays? And could you just ballpark how big that business is now? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. We wish it was, but we're still so small in the flu business. If anything, we always -- we're probably still at that stage where it could possibly hurt us a touch as people may give up other visits to their doctors. But I think, overall, awash, but we don't see it being a big benefit to us yet just because we're not as big yet in that space. Michael Watts : Yes. Chris, just -- this is Mike. Just to give a little more color on that. I think we've said, last year, our Fusion respiratory assay revenue was around $10 million, a little bit less. So that will give you a sense. I mean certainly, we were up in the quarter as you would expect, and we would expect to be up in the year. But as Steve said, not a huge deal. Operator : And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Just looking at guidance, the midpoint and higher end obviously implies an acceleration, ex Cyno. Can you just talk about, by segment, where you're seeing the acceleration for 2020? Is it mostly on the GYN Surg side? And if so, how sustainable is that? You hit over 10% there this quarter, so just curious about where you see the acceleration this year. Karleen Oberton : Yes. Clearly, we're really pleased with the Surgical performance and the continued improved performance we've seen over the -- several quarters now. But yes, I would say acceleration is clearly from Surgical and probably Diagnostic as well. Tycho Peterson : And then you're bumping up the SSI guide from $25 million to $30 million to $30 million to $35 million. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're bundling that with the rest of the offering? Anything to note on the integration front and how you see that ramp going? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So I would just say that the increase really has to do with the timing of obtaining the controlling interest. So when we originally guided in Q4, we assumed we would not have a controlling interest and therefore, no revenue in the first quarter. So the uptake is really the timing of that controlling interest. And I think it's early days, but the integration is off to a start. And I think, as we've said before, SSI had minimal presence in the U.S., only, I think, 5 reps -- sales reps in the U.S. And so our teams are excited to drop that product into their -- our sophisticated commercial infrastructure here in the U.S. Operator : And our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan : I wanted to go back to the Molecular growth in the quarter and maybe just focus on what's going on in the U.S. I think you mentioned in the script that the core women's health was still growing well. But I'm just curious because we've seen, in just the past couple of quarters, I think last quarter, U.S. Molecular grew 9%. Just what was the -- maybe just why did that slow down a little bit in the quarter? Was there anything from a comp perspective? Or what's going on, on the women's health side? Michael Watts : Yes. Jack, it's Mike. I think we were pretty happy with the Molecular number in the quarter, both U.S. as well as OUS. As we've talked about in that business, it's not really any one thing that drives growth. Certainly, the core women's health assay, specifically chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV and Trich, are the biggest tests. So they have to grow for the business to kind of show the performance that you've seen, but they were up very solidly in the quarter in mature markets. Viral load was a nice contributor as well. I think we highlighted some growth in Africa, in particular, from viral load. And I would say some of the new products, particularly the vaginosis panel, the BV/CV test, are starting to contribute as well. So pleased with where that division is. And I guess I would say -- sorry, Jack, I guess the other thing. I mean remember, that had a really bad comp last year, too. It was a very challenging prior year comp. So that might be some of what you're seeing. Jack Meehan : Okay. Got it. And then I think on the flip side, with Cytology, I thought the international growth looks pretty good, and I know, working off somewhat small numbers. And I picked up, I guess, the comment around Germany. Just do you feel like there's -- how durable do you think the double digit on the international side is as a lever to keep Cytology nudging forward? Stephen MacMillan : I would not expect it to be a double-digit growth. I think like all these things in international, sometimes, it's the smaller bases and timing, you get a little capital sale, you get some things like -- having said that, I think we do see it being at least a slightly growing asset outside the U.S. to offset the declines in the U.S. And it's why I think, globally, we feel like Cytology is roughly a flattish business. And international gets a little more growth. It might tweak that slightly better, but I don't think it's necessarily a double-digit grower. Operator : And our next question comes from Bill Kirk with Piper Sandler. Rachel Vatnsdal : This is Rachel on for Bill. So the international Diagnostics business continues to grow to a fast level of a pace. How much of this is driven by new products versus share gains? And how long can this sort of pace continue? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I think we talked about -- I think the majority of the growth is from share gains, a little less from the -- the new products' contribution is the viral load internationally, which is contributing nicely. But we expect continued double-digit growth, probably maybe not at the rate that we've seen as they come against some of those tougher comps, but feel really good about that business. Stephen MacMillan : We have been placing more Panthers internationally over the recent quarters than we have in the U.S. So I think our ability to continue to sustain that we feel really good about. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. And then given the combination of new products across almost all of your divisions and M&A completed so far, how much capacity do your teams have for additional transactions? Karleen Oberton : I'm sorry. We couldn't hear that. Could you repeat that question? Rachel Vatnsdal : Yes. So given the combination of new products across all divisions and M&A completed so far, how much capacity do you think your teams have for additional transactions? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So I think the transactions that we've done to date have been in the Breast Health division because certainly, within Diagnostics and Surgical, there's more than adequate capacity to take on transactions. I think Breast Health has -- still has a very active M&A pipeline. They do have a lot of integration activities. But certainly, we feel that if the right deal came along, we have the ability to make the capacity to do a transaction. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian Weinstein : Just going back to OUS here for a minute. Obviously, it's been a great driver, and it looks like there's a lot to go here. But can you give us any kind of an update on where you actually do stand in terms of market share for some of the key products? You've typically said that they were around half of what they were for key products here in the States. Where is that now? And what are your longer-term kind of thoughts about where market shares can wind up over there? Can they get to U.S. level still, do you think? Stephen MacMillan : Brian, I think it's so hard, quite frankly, to really have a great handle on our market shares by segment because there's not great data on a lot of these. I think, anecdotally, from what we just feel, yes, there's still enormous opportunities ahead. And when you look at our relative revenue, under 1/4 of most of our businesses are outside the U.S., where clearly huge opportunities do, again, continue to be playing out not just in the coming quarters, but really, we think we've got a decade's worth of runway here in terms of solid growth before they even catch up to the U.S., probably ultimately the U.S. shares. Brian Weinstein : Okay. And then on some of the investments that you're talking about and having a little bit more flexibility to make some of those investments, what are the key strategic investment areas that you guys are focusing on this year? And if there was some upside to develop, where are the incremental investments likely to be made? Stephen MacMillan : Sure. There's always the extra R&D projects that will come up even during the course of the year that we'll look at. I think we now have better and better leadership internationally. And so that ability to be thinking about adding some more sales reps behind certain franchises in certain countries, I think those kind of opportunities are the kind that can -- we can redeploy efforts as we go through and then the occasional marketing activities as well. But it's really looked at by franchise, by geography, combination, sales, marketing, R&D. Operator : And our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Just two questions on earnings and margins for Karleen. Karleen, so $0.03 in the buyback, $0.02 to $0.04 from removed Cyno dilution. That's around $0.05 to $0.07, and you're raising the guide by $0.02. So that incremental $0.03 to $0.05 of additional reinvestment, where is that going? And a quick follow-up on margins. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So Dave, let me walk you through how we thought about we'd raise the guidance on the bottom line. So yes, we absorbed the $0.02, additional $0.02 loss. We'd talked about the ASR was about $0.02. Again, there is -- that includes the impact of the stranded costs in the -- from Cynosure because they will bring a piece of our overhead. And then the incremental ASR -- the incremental open share repurchase is less than $0.01 for the full year. So it gets you close to $0.025 at the midpoint. David Lewis : Okay. But you still expect the Cynosure divestiture to be $0.02 to $0.04 accretive for the year? Michael Watts : Yes, I don't -- hey, David, it's Mike. I don't know that we said $0.02 to $0.04 accretive for the year. I think when we announced the divestiture, basically, the business was breakeven or at least was expected to be breakeven for the year. Clearly, they did worse than that in the first quarter. We said that the combination of the divestiture and the ASR would be about $0.02 accretive. Maybe that's where we weren't clear. But -- so we were kind of looking at those things as roughly $0.02 accretive. And then, of course, we absorbed, as Karleen said, some extra dilution that's baked into the raise in Q1 here. Operator : Our next question will come from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Rajbir Denhoy : I wonder if maybe I could hit on a couple of things. You mentioned the gantry placement number has been pretty consistent at about 1,000 for several years running now. I realize that the acceleration of this business is only about 6 or 7 years old. But at some point, do we start to see a replacement cycle in 3D? Could that number start to pick up as you move out a couple of years from now? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I mean I think, eventually, that if you think about 3D was originally approved in 2011, but you had that significant uptake in the 2014, 2015 time frame. With the 7-year life, 7 to 9 year life, at some point, there's a replacement cycle there. But I think we've intentionally smoothed out that cycle with the upgrades that we're doing to the field now. Because if you think about our greatest gantry, 3D, 3Dimensions, those features and functionalities are backwards-compatible to the installed base. So really, trying to minimize that pent-up demand in our replacement cycle. So we feel good and really are pleased with the steady approach of placements over the coming years. Rajbir Denhoy : Okay. That's fair. And maybe just a follow-up on the last question, on David's question, about the guidance, the earnings guidance, in particular, all of the raises just around the ASR and the Cynosure divestiture. And so Karleen, I'm just curious about your views on sort of other margin expansion initiatives, which you guys can undertake over the next year-plus in order to take your margins even higher than where they are now. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So certainly, that's always a focus, to create leverage in an operating margin. And I think, always, we have ongoing programs within the supply chain organization to work on that. And then there's still efforts within the middle of the P&L that we can take. It's an active -- it's an ongoing activity throughout the organization to look for leverage points. Stephen MacMillan : I would remind you, Raj, as you well know, our margins are already pretty good. So a big part of our focus at this point has really been on accelerating that organic growth rate via the investments in R&D, sales, marketing. And we think, overall, it's going to be a pretty good combination, but more on accelerating the sales growth than on huge additional focuses on margins. But again, obviously, we're always working and expect to improve the margins as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Ivy Ma with Bank of America. Ivy M&A: Karleen, appreciate the color on the guide so far. Not to beat the margin question to death, I just wanted to see how should we think about the margin improvement in this fiscal year and beyond given the removal of Cynosure in terms of both gross margin and operating margin would be great. And then I have a follow-up on the gross margin this quarter as well. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So if you look even at just what we've guided to for Q2, 62% to 63%, compared to where we ended Q1, you can see the midpoint of the 100 basis improvement in the margin profile. So I think that's 50 to 100 basis points is how we're thinking the impact is for Cynosure as we move forward. And I think operating margins certainly will be more than that on the gross margin given that Cynosure was such a heavy OpEx business. Ivy Ma : Great. That's helpful. And then a follow-up. So on the gross margin decline this quarter, could you help us unpack how much in the 60 bps just relates to Cynosure, the mix and then the stuff that you would see, please? Karleen Oberton : Yes, maybe I'll describe it another ways. The majority of that decline was really Cynosure. So if you looked at the base business, gross margins are essentially flat year-over-year. And if we looked at quarterly trending of gross margins in '19, Q1 was our best gross margin quarter. So majority is really Cynosure-related. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : So I wanted just to revisit the segment growth. I came off the fourth quarter call thinking Diagnostics, Breast Health, Surgical would all grow in that 4% to 5% range for the year. I realize that comps come into play here, but Surgical was obviously well above this level. Breast Health was below this level. So maybe you can just level-set us on segment expectations for the year, if they've changed at all. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think, overall, probably each of our businesses is going to grow solidly in the mid-singles for the year. Breast Health, that will include a little bit of help from SSI, as we said at the start. And then Surgical was probably a little bit at the higher end of that piece; and Diagnostics, pretty much right in the middle. So I think all of that gets to that 4% to 5% organic that we're talking about. Jayson Bedford : The Breast Health mid-single include SSI? Karleen Oberton : Yes. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think, as we always said, especially going against the first 2 quarters where we had these monster comps from a year ago. That's why our initial guidance, if you recall from last quarter, only called for 1.2% to 3.0% organic growth. Operator : And we'll go back to Dan Brennan with UBS. Nathan Treybeck : This is Nathan Treybeck calling for Dan Brennan. Can you hear me? Stephen MacMillan : Hey. There we go. All right. Michael Watts : A lot of pressure on this question now. Nathan Treybeck : Yes. Definitely. Third time is the charm, I guess. In terms of going back to Molecular, can you frame the size of the OUS opportunity in terms of, I guess, an addressable dollar figure? Stephen MacMillan : I don't know. We've got a great number on that because, again, just some of the data sources and other stuff. But I think it gets back to we have a lot of runway ahead to consider the size of our Molecular business outside the U.S. relative to inside. Can we easily double and triple it over the longer term where we are today to outside the U.S.? Yes. Nathan Treybeck : Okay. And just staying on Molecular. Can you discuss the split between share gains from other Molecular players versus, let's say, converting less from non-Molecular approaches? Stephen MacMillan : It's so hard to know that when you start to deal country-by-country and everything else. I think we feel good about the trajectory. And obviously, it sources above. Operator : And our next question will come from Ivy Ma with Bank of America. Ivy Ma : I just wanted to talk about Surgical for a minute. Can you talk about how sustainable is that segment's growth and what your expectations are for the rest of this fiscal year, especially as the comp gets tougher later in the year? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I think we -- what we said is Surgical -- I think Steve just talked about the segment, that we expect Surgical at the high end of that mid-single digit given the Q1 performance. Again, we have contribution from new products coming throughout the continuation of the year. But to your point, we are coming up against higher comps. So that's why we don't -- we're not projecting that 10% for the full year. Operator : And thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Have a good evening.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to Hologic's Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Bryce and I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call. Please go ahead. Michael Watts : Thank you, Bryce. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through May 22.  Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in our safe harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue. As a reminder, we're defining organic revenue as constant currency revenue less the divested Blood Screening and Cynosure businesses as well as the acquired SuperSonic Imagine business. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by stating the obvious. This is an unprecedented time for the company, our shareholders and the entire world. Therefore, we're going to structure our remarks differently today. First, I'm going to discuss 3 strategic topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic, then hand it over to Karleen, who will cover our results and outlook.  Rather than keep you in suspense, here are my key points upfront. First, Hologic was performing exceptionally well until late March, continuing the strong momentum that has been building over the last few years. Second, as COVID-19 spread and threaten global economies, we moved quickly to mitigate the risk with a focus on cash so that our healthy fundamentals would be intact on the other side of the pandemic. And third, as one of the world's leading molecular diagnostics firms, this is a unique moment for us to live into our purpose by providing solutions for the most important issue facing the globe today. So while we are scaling back in some areas in the short term, we are simultaneously boosting investments in our diagnostics business to respond to the world's needs, which will make us a much stronger company on the other side of this. Obviously, it's our employees who are making this possible, and we want to take a moment to thank them. I am so unbelievably proud of the engagement and commitment we've seen inside Hologic in the face of these challenging times. Countless employees from all our divisions have volunteered to help with our COVID efforts, offering everything from new business ideas that keep customers safe to their own hands and feet for the packaging line in our San Diego plant.  A special thanks goes out to our diagnostics team under the leadership of Kevin Thornal. In so many ways, the work of countless current and former employees over the years has positioned us to have a massive impact when the world needs us most. But I'd like to specifically highlight Marcos Borrell's project managers; Maurice Exner's development team; Matt Friedenberg's instrument group; Kathy Chester's regulatory team; Dave Tyler's manufacturing organization; and Keith Gantner's commercial team. Someday, you'll look back on this as one of the highlights of your professional careers, mainly because the world has never needed you more. We'll catch up on sleep when we reach the other side, which we will.  With that introduction, now let me turn to those 3 key points. First, we were performing exceptionally well until late March, continuing the strong momentum that's been building over the last few years. This is important because women's health needs are not going away due to COVID-19 and we'll still be a market leader on the other side of the pandemic. Our growth strategies will continue to pay off. We'll keep leveraging our strong U.S. commercial positions in breast health, diagnostics and surgical. We'll keep growing internationally across all our franchises. We'll keep investing in innovative research and development that drives new product growth, and we'll keep boosting our growth rate through tuck-in acquisitions.  As we said in our earnings release, organic revenue growth was 5.2% through the end of February and we were on pace for another beat-and-raise quarter. Three areas drove our growth in the second quarter. First, global molecular revenue increased 14.2%, the highest growth rate since 2012. This included only about $3.4 million of assay revenue related to our COVID test. Excluding this, the business still grew more than 12% as we continue to layer additional tests including now our COVID assays onto our Panther installed base. Make no mistake about it, our Molecular Diagnostics business is on a roll on a global basis.  Second, sales in our European region grew by a whopping 20.8% for the second quarter, excluding the divested Cynosure business. An outstanding performance by Jan Verstreken's team. Diagnostics led the way in the quarter, driven by cervical cancer co-testing in Germany and viral load testing in Africa. But Breast Health and Surgical also posted low double-digit growth.  Third, U.S. Surgical was incredibly strong for most of the quarter, up 14.7% in the first two months, building on recent acceleration and on pace to be an exceptional quarter. For the full quarter, U.S. Surgical still managed to grow 3.1% despite a significant decline in March.  Now let me turn to our second key point. As COVID-19 spread and threaten global economies in March, we moved quickly to mitigate the risk with a focus on cash. Our primary goal was to ensure that our healthy fundamentals would still be intact on the other side of the pandemic. I'd like to highlight several actions in this regard. First, our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet over the last several years prepared us well to face the COVID crisis. For example, several years ago, we established a $1.5 billion revolving credit line, with a very attractive interest rate and covenants that are usually seen only with investment-grade companies. As the pandemic rapidly spread, we moved quickly to borrow $750 million from this line of credit, both to prepare for lower future cash flows and to pay off our $250 million accounts receivable securitization program. We wanted to act early and be at the front of the line with our bank partners. We also suspended our share buyback activities in March. Before then however, we completed our previously announced ASR and also repurchased 5.9 million shares for $267.6 million, which we believe will be an excellent investment over the long term.  Second, we moved quickly and decisively to reduce operating expenses through a combination of actions, hopefully temporary, that were specific to each division, function and geography across the company. Based on the needs of each business, we eliminated temporary employees and contractors, furloughed employees and temporarily shut down or shortened work weeks at several of our manufacturing plants. In other areas, we implemented broad pay reductions. We cut salaries for me and the Board by 50%, for our global leadership team by 25% and for other salaried employees by roughly 10%. At the same time, we made conscious decisions to preserve 401(k) matches and actually supplement the compensation of those salespeople who would normally receive 100% of their pay through commissions. Our goals were to keep our good people, reduce outright layoffs as much as possible and be in a position to emerge quickly on the other side of the pandemic.  In total, these and other actions should help us temporarily reduce operating expenses compared to the second quarter run rate by almost $40 million in the third quarter. Going forward, we intend to continue managing discretionary spending closely, while still taking care of our employees and funding future growth initiatives, such as boosting capital expenditures to ramp up our COVID manufacturing capacity.  Which brings us to our third major topic. As one of the world's leading molecular diagnostics firms, this is a special moment in time for us to live into our corporate purpose and become a much stronger company in the process. Building on the success we've had over the last several years, in placing Panther instruments around the world. We are in a unique position to help fight the coronavirus by providing the molecular testing that's needed to preserve human health as well as reopen our economies. And our efforts could provide a significant positive offset to pressures elsewhere in our business.  When the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was published in January, our scientists immediately jumped on it, just as they did when H1N1 influenza and the Zika virus emerged in the past. Our focus then was on speed. We wanted to get a test to market as soon as possible. With support from BARDA, we were able to secure emergency use authorization for our assay in about 2 months. We chose to develop a PCR-based test for a few reasons. First, it was faster as we leveraged the Open Access software that was previously written for the Fusion module. Second, we sell PCR-based test for influenza and other respiratory viruses that run on the Fusion side of our instrument. These viruses can cause symptoms that resemble COVID-19 disease so we wanted to give labs the capability to test a single patient sample for multiple targets. Third, there was a clear regulatory pathway for assays based on PCR, which is the backbone of most existing respiratory tests and the first couple of COVID assays.  Today, we have all come to understand that a real key to controlling this disease and getting people back to work is delivering fast, highly accurate test results on a truly unprecedented scale. Let me focus on that word results. Many investors have asked us why U.S. testing volumes are still limited, even as the diagnostics industry is producing more tests. One reason is that many of these tests are run on manual or semi-automated systems, putting a tremendous strain on lab technicians who are in short supply to begin with. Some of these systems require reagents from multiple vendors, which have been limited. In addition, while point-of-care tests have an important role to play against the pandemic, they can't be done in high volumes. In fact, high-volume testing has been concentrated in a relatively small number of labs, which can lead to longer turnaround times and backlogs.  For all these reasons, we quickly dedicated enormous resources to develop a second COVID test to run on the base Panther system, using our proprietary Aptima technologies, including transcription-mediated amplification, which is an alternative to PCR. Our lab customers already use these Aptima technologies to perform tens of millions of molecular tests a year for sexually transmitted infections, cervical cancer screening and virology. There are 2 major advantages to this approach, which is again, being supported by BARDA, this time with about $13 million.  First, because our supply chain has been scaled to produce massive numbers of Aptima tests for other infectious diseases, we can now redirect these manufacturing resources to produce large quantities of coronavirus assays. Specifically, we expect to provide our lab customers about 3 million Aptima tests next week -- yes, 3 million -- and are planning to produce at least 1 million tests a week starting in late May. Customers using our Aptima assays do not need to perform additional sample preparation steps or by other commercial reagents for nucleic acid extraction. This should help reduce competition for raw materials and further increase global testing capacity.  Finally, to help alleviate shortages of commonly used sample collection swabs and transport media, we have validated our Aptima multitest swab specimen collection kit, which is used today, mainly for STD testing for use with both the Aptima and Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assays.  Second, our Aptima tests run on the world's largest installed base of high throughput systems. More than 1,800 Panthers are in use globally compared to about 200 of the much newer Panther Fusion platform. You can do the simple math. This is almost a tenfold increase in our ability to leverage our industry-leading installed base of high throughput instruments. This means that more hospital, public health and reference lab customers can apply the power of full automation to coronavirus testing. This automation reduces hands-on time and the potential for manual error, and helps reduce the labor bottlenecks that have emerged given the unprecedented volume of COVID tests needed. So our lab customers will be able to deliver more results when and where they are needed.  Adding a COVID assay to the Panther menu provides a unique opportunity to turbocharge the strategy we have been pursuing in molecular diagnostics for years. COVID testing will help us place more Panthers, both in the United States and overseas, and also drive higher assay utilization on the systems that are already in the field, and it will accelerate the positive change in diagnostics that we've previously discussed, as we move from being the leader in STDs to a much stronger position as a broad-based molecular diagnostics leader with strong customer partnerships.  Before I turn it over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that in these unprecedented times, our purpose, passion and promise remains steadfast. Our purpose is to help enable healthier lives everywhere, every day. Never has that been more relevant than today as we battle a global pandemic. Our passion is to become global champions for women's health. Obviously, women are affected by COVID-19, but when the pandemic is under control, demand for our market-leading products and services will come back. Early detection of diseases like breast and cervical cancer will always be important. And our promise is rooted in what we call The Science of Sure, providing highly accurate, differentiated products, which has never been more important than when combating a public health crisis. As difficult as the current environment is, I have never been more energized about our chance to play a major role in the toughest issue facing the world today while knowing that our efforts today are also strengthening us for the future.  Now let me turn the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through the rest of our income statement, briefly touch on our overall financial condition and discuss some expectations for the future. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis and constant currency. Let me start by summarizing our second quarter results. Revenue of $756.1 million declined 7.1% due to the divestiture of Cynosure. Organically, we grew 1.1% despite the impact of COVID-19 pandemic late in the quarter. EPS of $0.57 was below our expectations, commensurate with the decrease in revenue but basically flat compared to a year ago.  Now I will provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. Diagnostics became our largest division in the second quarter by growing a strong 8.3%, despite a substantial decrease in demand in late March. Cytology had a good quarter internationally, driven by Germany's decision to adopt co-testing for cervical cancer screening. But the primary growth driver was Molecular, as it has been for many quarters. International sales were exceptionally strong, based in part on the continued uptake of viral load assays in Africa. The U.S. business performed very well, even when you exclude sales of our COVID assay on Panther Fusion, which were only $3.4 million in the quarter.  In Breast Health, underlying trends were solid, and the division performed well through most of the quarter. However, gantries, accessories and 3D upgrade volumes were substantially impacted as a result of COVID-19 disruptions late in March, as our customers focus on responding to the pandemic and our field service engineers weren't allowed to install new products. Given these factors, global Breast Health sales of $307.8 million decreased 3.7%, excluding $5.8 million of sales from SuperSonic Imagine, global sales decreased 5.5%.  In Surgical, Steve already pointed out that the team was crushing at through most of March, especially in the United States. However, like most companies, we saw a significant impact to demand in late March as elective procedures were postponed. Despite this, the business still grew 3.6% for the full quarter based on the excellent momentum we had in January and February.  Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $574.9 million were down 1% on an organic basis and down 6.6% on a reported basis due to the Cynosure divestiture. Outside the United States, reported sales of $181.2 million decreased 8.6% but revenue increased 8.4% organically, reflecting the strong foundations we have built for sustainable growth. As Steve noted, this growth was primarily driven by our European and Canadian franchises. Not surprisingly, sales in Asia Pacific were negatively affected by COVID, especially in China.  Moving on to our P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin of 61% was actually flat compared to the prior year period, as benefits from the Cynosure divestiture were offset by lower sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unfavorable product sales mix, and to a lesser extent, the strong U.S. dollar. Total operating expenses of $222.5 million decreased 18.4% in the second quarter, which was primarily driven by the divestiture of Cynosure. In addition, the decline in equity markets reduced expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan as the liability is marked to market. Finally, as Steve said, we did begin to reduce discretionary costs in late March as the negative effects of COVID-19 became more clear. As a result, operating margin of 31.5% increased 380 basis points. Overall, our profitability remains very healthy.  Net margin of 20% increased 100 basis points compared to the prior year period, with the benefits I just discussed, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. This resulted from an unfavorable divisional and geographic mix of income, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. All this led to non-GAAP net income of $150.9 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.57, commensurate with our lower-than-expected revenue. Finally, ROIC was 12.5% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $248.3 million, which decreased 2.3% compared to the prior year.  Moving on, I'd like to briefly discuss our overall financial condition as we navigate through these uncertain times. The COVID-19 pandemic is a vivid reminder of how and how fast unforeseen events can change our economic environment. But even in this context, Hologic's financial position is strong because we have put a heavy emphasis on debt reduction and cash flow generation over the last several years. Maintaining a conservative liquidity posture is even more important during these challenging times as we focus on taking care of our employees, ensuring our products remain available to our customers and patients, and investing in critical COVID-19 diagnostics testing.  At the end of the second quarter, our leverage ratio stood at 2.6x and we had approximately $800 million of cash and equivalents. The actions we have taken to reduce expenses, which Steve discussed, have put us in a strong position to weather a wide range of potential outcomes that may emerge over the coming months related to COVID-19. Before we open the call for questions, I would like to discuss our expectations for the second half of fiscal 2020. As a reminder, we withdrew our formal financial guidance when we preannounced quarterly revenue earlier this month. To state the obvious, the market environment is very fluid and unpredictable today. Our future results will be highly dependent on what the virus does and how successful global containment efforts are. But I want to clearly emphasize that we believe we are well prepared for either extreme scenario, a strong recovery or a prolonged downturn. That said, to give you a sense of the magnitude of the effect that COVID-19 has had on our business, we expect organic sales in our fiscal April to be down 45% to 50% from the prior year period, excluding sales of our COVID test on Panther Fusion, which we'll come back to in a second. We are planning for our base business to be down by a similar percentage for the full quarter. Again, excluding our own COVID assay sales since April sales probably benefited a little from our strength through most of March. By planning for a significant downturn and being ready for it, we believe we prepare appropriately for an uncertain time.  By division, we believe that Surgical will be the hardest hit by COVID in the short term. In April, for example, global Surgical sales are expected to be down about 85% compared to the prior year period. We believe this business will begin to improve soon based on both the clinical need and the desire of our hospital customers to shore up their finances by addressing pent-up demand.  In Breast and Skeletal Health, April sales will be down more than 30% compared to the prior year period. Recurring revenues such as service should compensate somewhat for a steeper decline in capital sales, reflecting the diversification strategy that we have been pursuing for several years. We have recently seen access restrictions loosening somewhat, so we are optimistic that conditions will improve gradually going forward. The pace of this recovery, however, is uncertain as it's hard to predict how long a general economic downturn will affect capital investments by customers. While recovery could take a while, it's worth emphasizing that our Breast business has become far less capital dependent in recent years as we increase service and other recurring revenue across the full continuum of breast health care.  In Diagnostics, sales of our core women's health tests have fallen significantly as routine screening has been put on hold. April sales, as a result, are expected to be down about 45%, excluding sales of our Panther Fusion COVID assay. It's worth noting that the strength we've seen internationally in the areas like viral load testing should slightly offset the negative impact of COVID on our women's health assays. Our own COVID test, especially the new TMA assay on Panther, could represent a significant positive offset to the pressures we are experiencing in our other parts of our business. We know that in the near term, demand for our COVID assays is very high as testing is essential to get people back to work and reopen economies. And as we said in our press release, the combination of our large TMA manufacturing capacity with our Panther installed base can help labs deliver test results when and where they are needed. We could generate $150 million or more of COVID sales in our third fiscal quarter.  In the future, we believe that significant levels of testing will continue to be needed worldwide. But it's impossible to predict the exact quantity and duration at this stage. So from a revenue perspective going forward, we will continue to watch the interplay between recovery in our base businesses in COVID test volumes. We are hopeful that most of our businesses will get back to normal in the first half of our fiscal 2021. But if not, we believe we have significant offsets in terms of our own testing volumes. But if our base franchises gradually improve over the next several quarters and COVID revenues remain high, there's at least the potential that our results could be exceptionally strong. We are making plans to significantly increase our manufacturing capacity to prepare for this possibility.  Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that even in these uncertain times, the fundamentals of our business are strong as is our financial condition. Although COVID-19 will continue to negatively affect most of our business, our efforts to develop and manufacture molecular diagnostics test to fight the pandemic could represent a significant offset that will help us emerge a stronger company in the long run.  With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll now take our first question from Tycho Peterson at JP Morgan. Tycho Peterson : Steve, congrats on getting the new COVID test out. You highlighted the large installed base. I'm just curious about how you think about COVID driving incremental Panther placements, particularly on the hospital side, given the push toward more on-site testing? And then for the follow-up, I assume serology is not a focus given the divestiture of the Blood Screening business, but I'm curious if that's something you would consider? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. Thanks, Tycho. And by the way, Tony and the rest of the guys at the warehouse are busting their butts right now. So -- and part of it is on Panthers. We have, as you can imagine, getting a significant increase in interest in Panthers around the world. And I think everybody is realizing just what an incredible platform it is. So as a reminder, folks, we've been placing about 200 to 250 Panthers a year. Generally in that, call it, 20-ish a month. We are also scaling capacity right now for Panthers, they're much longer lead times but we're having significant additional requests, particularly as well, frankly, from departments of health, some of the additional labs from hospitals, but it's across the board and including even the largest reference labs. So it's almost across the board, people wanting to get even more access to capacity. On the serology piece, to your second part, yes, don't expect us to really do anything there. We're not sure we bring anything to the party in that game. We're just putting all of our resources in the molecular world that we know so well. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Patrick Donnelly at Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Steve, maybe a follow-up there, talking about the significant increase in interest in Panthers. I guess there's a bit of a debate out there. Does this pandemic fundamentally change kind of the diagnostics market on the other side of this, you might see a broad increase in testing? I guess what's your guys view on the diagnostics side that you feel like you're getting out in front of customers you didn't have the opportunity to before and you could get integrated with some new systems and all of a sudden, on the other side of this, Hologic was great during COVID. Now why don't we use them for a bunch of other testing? What's your view for the Diagnostics business as we get to the other side of this one? Stephen MacMillan : I'll try to answer this real simply because it's an incredibly insightful question, Patrick. We've never had more calls from people wanting our products. And I mean this on a very global basis, right to various regions within European countries, particularly, frankly, all across Europe but also wildly in the U.S. We've literally been in touch with virtually every governor's office. It seems like half of Congress, obviously, with the White House Task Force on a daily basis, the Department of Defense, it's been mind blowing in terms of the interest, really just since we launched the PCR assay. And Kevin Thornal, our commercial teams and our European teams, even the Asia Pac teams, right down to the Prime Minister in New Zealand, I mean we've got everybody reaching out to us and it is elevating our profile to a very different level than anything we've ever experienced. And there is zero doubt in my mind that's absolutely creating a tremendous runway for us coming out of this. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the Breast Health side. I know you talked about, obviously, volumes are very hard to predict there and the recurring revenue is a bigger piece of the business for you guys now. I guess how quickly do you think this could come back again on the other side of COVID? I mean do you expect women to be a bit reluctant to come back into the doctor's office? Or do you think things could ramp pretty quickly? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think it's still an evolving piece, Patrick. I think -- frankly, our orders were positive in the quarter. We had a tremendous Breast Health orders quarter. I do worry and having lived through the '08-'09 downturn, where I know a lot of the hospitals and the radiology suites, they want new capital. I'm sure in a month or 2, as things start to settle back down, you know hospital CFOs are going to go back through their CapEx with a fine tooth comb and do some of those get pushed out.  I think if we're a betting person, I think Breast Health will probably be a little slower to come back because of that. Now the positive for us is, remember, we don't really get paid on a -- even as the patients take a little time to get back in, we've got the capital sales and then the recurring revenue in a lot of cases, really from service and those kinds of things. So it probably won't go down quite as deeply but it will probably be a longer road back. Karleen Oberton : Yes. I would just add to kind of remind folks that the U.S. gantries, the U.S. capital is only about 21% of the total divisional revenue at this point in time. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Brian Weinstein at William Blair. Brian Weinstein : Congrats on the progress that you guys made with this new assay. Should we be thinking about an ASP similar to what you saw in Fusion on a worldwide basis here? And then I think Karleen was kind of talking about this a little bit, the ability to manufacture. Should we be thinking about this level of manufacturing even when core Aptima kind of comes back? Or will there need to be some sort of a trade off there? Stephen MacMillan : Great question, Brian. And I think as we look forward, certainly, some of this will be volume dependent, but we've been building our capacity to be able to serve, even as the core business comes back to also be able to meet these demands. So it's -- we're looking at our total capacity to be able to deliver on this. Karleen Oberton : Yes. And I would just say, we have, as Steve made meaningful investments in capital to do that, so that we don't have to make those trade offs. Brian Weinstein : And then on that ASP, around 25%, is that how we should be thinking about it? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I'd probably go just a little below that, probably when you think about a global weighted ASP. Brian Weinstein : Okay. And then a final question here. I know you mentioned not being involved in serology and that makes sense. But is there an opportunity here for you to participate in viral load? We're seeing much more literature about viral load being used to determine kind of where somebody is in the course of the COVID-19 infection or maybe using viral load to trying to determine how severe that infection might be. Is the team working on anything there? Is that an opportunity for you guys, given your presence there? Stephen MacMillan : It's not a focus at this point. We've been so locked and loaded on trying to realize this major testing opportunity, which we think is going to be the single biggest need to really get people back to work and everything else. But like everything else, as we get this out the door and as the science continues to evolve, our team will be looking at the areas that do make some sense for us. And that one clearly would be closer in, but nothing under progress at this point or nothing under development at this point, to be honest. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Doug Schenkel at Cowen. Doug Schenkel : Steve, and I'll echo what others have said, thanks to you and the team for moving so quickly with more solutions in the midst of the pandemic. The first thing I want to touch on is -- and this has kind of been alluded to in some of the other questions, there are clinical labs that we've talked to and we've read about that have talked about molecular systems, being hard to get and oftentimes being on back order. We know you've been placing around 200 Panthers per year and that's separate from the pandemic. I guess the question is, what is capacity for Panthers? And for that matter, Fusions to add on to existing Panthers? And then I guess that's really the first part.  I guess another question is, is it possible -- I just don't remember, is it possible to run Panther and Fusion assays simultaneously? So why don't I pause there on those questions? Stephen MacMillan : Sure. On the second part, yes, you can run Panther and Fusion simultaneously. In terms of supply, I think part of the reason, frankly, that Dr. Birx and the government are so excited that we're a little bit of the cavalry coming to the rescue here is we already have the systems everywhere. We're the only folks that have high throughput systems in all 50 states. So while there were a lot of tests that were approved and suddenly people are scrambling for equipment, I think we feel pretty good that we've already got this massive installed base that's been building over the last 6, 7 years as opposed to this mass scramble now. Can we supplement it? Are we getting additional requests? Yes. But fundamentally, we can ship 3 million tests next week. And the capacity is already there to be able to produce -- to be able to run those. Doug Schenkel : Yes. Yes. No, that's a great point. Okay. And then I know there's been some other questions about adjacencies that you might be able to move into to do more than you're already doing, which again, is great. But I guess one thing I'm wondering is as we think about reopening in the U.S. and broadly, there's a lot of talk about the need to not just run a lot more tests but potentially to move closer to point of care, especially when it comes to things like using molecular test as part of getting folks back to work for some employers. Is there any opportunity for you guys to do something there? I mean I know it would be herculean to move quickly on like a smaller Aptima-based system for use in smaller labs. But I'm just wondering, is there anything that was maybe already going there that could be expedited to allow you to play a bigger role in that need? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, Doug, I think, again, the best thing we have going for us is already the installed base that we have out there. It's hard to underscore the people over 1,000 of these systems in the United States. So let's just take an example, Northwell hospital or the more than 400 of these that are already in the hospitals. One of the key areas to keeping our health care workers safe is making sure that they're all tested on a regular basis. So picture this. Most of the hospitals that already have these employees at the end of the day could all be tested. The test can be run overnight and in the morning, they know if somebody shouldn't show up for work. The same can be true in so many decentralized areas, even companies around, not necessarily via us, but there's going to be labs all over the place, very close that we'll be able to run these things.  So it's back to -- it's not point -- let's be very clear, we are not point of care, but we are able to run a whole bunch of tests in a very local geography. So to a large degree, again, if somebody wants to do a drive-through, pop-up thing, there's generally a Panther not too far away that they should be able to access through either a hospital lab, one of the reference labs or even the departments of health within their states. So again, we -- do we wish we had even more? Yes, but it's already an incredible installed base that again, nobody else has had. When you look at the marketplace, you got point-of-care on one end and you've got the massive systems in a centralized reference lab at the other end, which you have not had is the ability to have high throughput testing close to the patient to be able to deliver those results where and when they're needed, not a week later. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Ivy Ma at Bank of America. Ivy M&A: Congrats on the new test. So first question is we've seen estimates from anywhere just on the broad testing market, the need for like anywhere 50,000 -- 500,000 molecular test a day and up to 1 million a day just throwing around in the news these days. So just wanted to get your thoughts on what sort of capacity expectations or need expectations you are eventually planning for since there are plans to get to -- to make investment to increase that by the fall. So first part of this question is just on what you think the ultimate testing need will be and how long the duration of that is. And this goes into a question about where you think your ultimate market share would be. Stephen MacMillan : Sure, Ivy. I'll start backwards. In terms of market share, we're not really focused on that the way we typically are because I think we're all rooting -- it's a unique time in the world where I think we're less about competing against each other and more all trying to race to create enough capacity to help not just this country but help the world get back to work, which kind of gets back to the first part of your question. There are so many unknowns. Come the fall, are we running 500,000 tests a day. Are we running 200,000 tests a day, we're running 3 million tests a day in the U.S. It's just so hard to know at this point in time. We are planning to continue to invest in capacity. Candidly, one of the biggest rate-limiting steps for us is our very unique cap system, which is what makes our system so highly automated.  We're building more cap machines. These things typically take 18 months to build. We've got people working around the clock to try to build them and call it a 6-month time frame. So we want to be prepared to bring on even more capacity later in the fall, ahead of the next flu season in the Northern Hemisphere because we do believe the way we look at it is, next year, when anybody -- there's any outbreak of flu or anything as soon as somebody coughs we're going to be wanting to be testing them just for regular flu as well as for COVID. So we want to have even more capacity online by the fall. But I don't really want to get into giving specific numbers. Ivy Ma : Great. Appreciate sharing the color. I know there's a lot of unknowns around this. So just a follow-up on serology. There's clearly a lot of serology testing capacity in the U.S., maybe more than that is in molecular. So I'm just curious how you see the market demand evolving going forward in terms of the split between molecular and serologic testing, especially when we're thinking more about getting people back to work? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. At the end of the day, we view there's going to be a massive need for diagnostic testing because at the end of -- even in a serology world, first off, there's so many unknowns with serology, as you well know, just because you may have some antibodies and it may appear -- are you really immune to others? There's just a lot of uncertainties to it and it's still going to be only a percentage of the population. At the end of the day, what is going to be critically important to getting people confident to go back into the workplace, to get to back to where we can have everybody back in school, have people traveling on airplanes again, has got to be a robust testing real-time capability. And that plays to our strength. That's where our focus is. And again, how big the serology market becomes on that end, we don't know but we frankly think there's enough for us to play in, in the area that we know a lot about. Operator : We'll now be taking our next question from Raj Denhoy at Jefferies. Anthony Petrone : This is Anthony for Raj, and I'll second and third the congratulations here. It's unbelievable work you guys have done. Maybe Scott -- Steve, just a question on something you mentioned in your prepared remarks, just in terms of the availability of viral transport medium swabs as you scale on Panther, the SARS-CoV-2 test on Panther as opposed to Fusion, how much of a limitation is that? Is there an opportunity for Hologic to actually bundle there? And then the second quick follow-up would be just any thoughts on the Boston Scientific announcement today on the sale of their intrauterine portfolio to Minerva? What are the implications for NovaSure? Stephen MacMillan : Anthony, say hi to Raj for us, too. As it relates to the swab, the magic that we referenced, obviously, is we're -- we've qualified our Aptima swab to be used along with us. So the great part about it is we basically have some degree, it's a closed system, we can ship the swab and the vials together, boom, they test, use our swab and they're ready to go. So we're providing the customer with effectively a complete package. And I think that's going to dramatically streamline. I think it's hard for people that aren't close to these to fully understand the incredible workflow efficiencies that come from using the Aptima system all the way through. So that should be a huge advantage for us.  On the Boston news with Minerva, I think we continue to feel really good about what our Surgical business is doing. As we mentioned, it was up 14.7% through the first 2 months of the last quarter. Our Surgical business has just really had an incredible turnaround and strength over the last couple of years. Clearly, Boston was not -- they're an incredibly successful company and having a challenge in that space with those products, I think our team is quite happy to see whoever is out there and continue to fight. So we think we've got better products and a better sales team. Operator : We'll now take our next question from David Lewis at Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Two testing questions for me, one for Karleen and one for Steve. So clearly, I just wanted to net out some math here for the third quarter. So if I just assume capacity for a second here, we have roughly $45 million of Fusion sales, maybe $75 million in that bolus Panther order. You get to 1 million test per week at the end of May, so it's kind of 1 million tests a week in June, that's another, obviously, kind of $100 million. And then if I just adjust that ASP below 25% and assume kind of a 20%, 30% cannibalization rate on the core platform, does that kind of get me close to $150 million? Anything materially off in that math? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I would say that the 1 million per week is an average. So with lot -- this product is built in lot, so we may not actually ship 1 million each week. But yes, that probably gets you pretty close. David Lewis : Okay. And then, Steve, I think getting Panther out there can be underestimated from sort of public health perspective. I want you to just sort of share your thoughts. There's been significant barriers to testing, reagents, nasal swabs and then general protocols and infrastructure, I would sort of call it, and yet 5 days ago, we have 300,000 tests a day and then yesterday, we had 200,000 tests. So reagents are coming on but the test numbers haven't gone in the right direction. As you think about the infrastructure and these barriers that have been addressed, just wondering if you could share your thoughts with us about do you think all the barriers have been addressed out there? And what are some of the outstanding barriers that are sort of creating this disconnect between capacity and then usable test? And great work on this. Stephen MacMillan : Sure, David. And I think the way to think about the barriers that you're getting to is, I think one of the biggest barriers, let's face it, just in normal day-to-day activities has been people who feel like they should be tested to actually getting tests. And so I think they've -- all of the states, all the hospitals, all the doctors have been fairly restrictive in allowing people to get tested. You've had to fight through hoops and everything just to get a test because the supply was so constrained. So I think one of the magical things that may start to happen right now is as people start to get more comfortable that there's -- the supply is really starting to ramp up, I think we will start to see a little bit more of the loosening of the gauntlet that a patient has to run through to get tested.  And I think as we start to open that up, to me, the magic of that will be, we'll start to get truly more tests out there. The ability of the people on the front line just to administer the swabs, so I think, again, in our case, we're going to have the swabs. You don't need separate transport media when it gets to the lab, you don't need somebody to extract it from the transport media, put it into another vial. So there's an incredible -- and I think you understand as well, there's an incredible efficiency on that side. So I think it's like everything, even in another week, things will start to go out. You know what we know that Dr. Birx and her team are in touch with all the public health labs, letting people know where we're coming. There's incredible excitement there. I think those things will, I think, help to finally unlock. It's not going to be the unlock, but I think the progress there will really start to see coming in a big way. Michael Watts : Operator, I think we have time for maybe two more questions, if we can be quick. Operator : Yes. And we'll now be taking our next question from Dan Leonard at Wells Fargo. Daniel Leonard : So I'll just ask one. Steve, you've talked a lot about the Aptima test for COVID. As we think about 12 months down the road, your Fusion is about 10% of your Panther total installed base. Does that ratio meaningfully change, post this pandemic? Do you see yourself having a much higher proportion of Fusions? Or is all the excitement around just the traditional Panther, not to minimize it, but just I'm curious your thoughts on that equation. Stephen MacMillan : Sure, Dan. I think it will ramp up over time. If anything, it will probably take a short-term pause because we're going to be running the machines probably at a fairly hefty pace. Nobody's going to even want to shut one down to accommodate adding a Fusion onto the side. And now with the TMA assay out there, they frankly can manage without it for a while. So I think we'll continue to build it over time. Mike, did you want to add something? Michael Watts : Yes. Dan, the only thing I would say is once we get into the fall and the winter with the flu season and you get kind of intermingled virus in order to be able to test for both, you do need a Fusion. So we think that will be helpful in the medium term as well. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. Michael Watts : We have time for one more question, operator. Operator : All right. We'll now be taking our last question from Dan Brennan at UBS. Daniel Brennan : I guess I'll ask a question on Breast Health then. So the numbers that you gave for April and for the quarter, maybe could you parse out a little bit between, Steve, in terms of the U.S. gantry being 20%, but how do we think about the math on that in terms of what gantries are doing, kind of service and then interventional? And then as we look out, is there any predicate for '08 and '09 that you suggested about how we might look further out beyond the next quarter or 2 and how hospital CFOs might react? Stephen MacMillan : Sure. We're kind of describing this internally as everybody talks about Vs, Ws, Ls, use whatever in terms of recovery. We're describing it as kind of a checkmark, a sharp down and then certainly coming back, I think nicely, it will be probably a little jagged there on the way back up. But I think what we see and we feel really good about the Breast Health business overall that it has become so much more diversified. But the capital will probably be lagging a little bit as it comes back.  And then the flip side is, in the grand scheme, our capital purchases are also not a huge amount for any given hospital system. So we're not totally sure, but we feel really good that we're going to be able to work with our customers to have it coming back online. But I would -- I think we'll be back by a year from now but I wouldn't expect to be back in the next couple of quarters. Karleen? Karleen Oberton : Yes. And I would just add, the biggest component of revenue for that business is the service business. So this stability within foundationally for that division was that recurring revenue. Michael Watts : Great. Thank you, everybody. Operator : Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions today.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to Hologic\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cody and I\u2019m your operator for today\u2019s call. Today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Watts : Thank you, Cody. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the Company\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session. Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through August 21st. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release, and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue. As a reminder, we are defining organic revenue as constant currency revenue less the divested Blood Screening and Cynosure businesses, as well as the acquired SuperSonic Imagine business. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic\u2019s CEO. Steve MacMillan : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We\u2019re pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Our results were very strong, and reflect the value of our unique set of businesses in a time of great economic uncertainty. To begin, these last several months have been the most challenging, tumultuous, and unpredictable time of my career, but also the most exhilarating and ultimately gratifying. There\u2019s still a lot of history to be written regarding this pandemic, and things can change very quickly in COVID time. But, we\u2019re very pleased with the significant contributions Hologic has made to human health thus far, and excited about our ability to do even more. I am just so proud of our team, who are working day and night with customers, regulators, suppliers, elected officials and others to address the most pressing problem facing the world today. In the last couple of years, we\u2019ve talked a lot about social responsibility and Hologic\u2019s corporate purpose, to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day. It is this purpose that inspired our people to do more than seemed possible in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Never before have we lived into our mission more completely or touched more human lives than during the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, our results flow from the positive impact we\u2019re making on human health. Karleen will cover the details, but let\u2019s start by saying that while the quarter began with great uncertainty and painful decisions to preserve cash flow, it ended with results that were better than we ever envisioned. We posted total revenue of $822.9 million and earnings per share of $0.75. Revenue grew 8.1% organically, and EPS increased 19%. These growth rates, our best organic performance in a very long time, significantly beat our expectations at the start of the quarter. Outperformance was driven by unprecedented demand for our COVID tests on the Panther system, as well as the quicker-than-expected strengthening of our surgical division. In addition, COVID testing surged late in the quarter, so our results also far exceeded the update we provided via the 8-K in June. We\u2019ll now highlight three primary points related to COVID, then Karleen will cover the rest of the business. First, our manufacturing and supply chain team did an amazing job in the quarter to ramp up production of our COVID assays, helping more labs and doctors deliver diagnostic insights when and where they are needed. Second, we believe our diagnostic response to COVID will have short, medium and long-term benefits for the Company as a whole. And third, the strengthening of our international franchises over the years is enabling us to make a big difference in the COVID fight today, which in turn will further accelerate our international business going forward. Let\u2019s start with manufacturing and supply chain, an area that doesn\u2019t get a lot of attention on the typical earnings call. That\u2019s unfortunate, because delivering high-quality, highly precise products that doctors rely on to make critical decisions is at the core of our business. In the case of COVID, we are producing millions of tests that weren\u2019t even invented a few short months ago, and each test has to meet exactingly high performance and quality standards. In this unique time when demand for COVID tests is exceeding supply, high-quality, high-volume manufacturing is critical. Although you\u2019d never know it from the media stories, the diagnostics industry as a whole has done an unbelievable job of ramping up COVID production capacity. As a nation, we are on pace to conduct about 23 million tests in July. This is more than double the level of testing as recently as May, and more than 20 times the number of tests performed in March. In total, more than 52 million COVID tests have been performed in the United States. For perspective, this is about 50% more than in the other G7 countries combined. Never before has a molecular diagnostic test been scaled up to these volumes, this fast. In fact, the amount of COVID testing being done today is about seven times greater than the next most common molecular diagnostic test. Our industry and its employees have a lot to be proud of, and we are striving to do more. In Hologic\u2019s case, as soon as we launched our first COVID assay in March, a PCR test that runs on Panther Fusion, we were overwhelmed with calls from customers everywhere. So, we immediately activated three key projects, working closely with our suppliers and partners around the world. First, we began developing a second COVID assay to leverage our proprietary Aptima technologies and manufacturing capacity, and to run on our large installed base of Panther instruments. Pre-COVID, we produced about 20 million molecular diagnostic tests a quarter, with the vast majority of this comprising TMA assays for infectious diseases like chlamydia, HPV and HIV. Since the pandemic reduced demand for these tests, we were able to redirect human and technological capacity to produce our Aptima COVID assay. In essence, we merged the supply chains for our COVID tests and our legacy products to increase COVID production capacity. Second, we set out to double our molecular diagnostics manufacturing capacity by the fall, to 40 million tests or more per quarter as we move into fiscal \u201821. We essentially established a goal to achieve our 10-year expansion plan in about six months. And third, we began working with our partner Stratec to roughly double production of our Panther instruments. Based on these actions, in our earnings call three months ago we shared our goal to produce at least 1 million COVID tests a week, on average, starting in late May. This would have enabled us to realize revenue of $150 million or more in the second quarter. Thanks to Herculean efforts by our operations team, we\u2019re proud to report that we significantly exceeded this goal, and were able to increase our total molecular diagnostics test production by about 50% in the third quarter, to roughly 30 million tests. This enabled us to ship almost 13 million COVID tests to customers, including an extra production lot, leading to sales of $324 million. Based on data from the COVID Tracking Project, we estimate that we provided one-fourth to one-third of the test results delivered in the United States during the quarter. How did we get there? Through a combination of ingenuity, investment and brute force. In terms of ingenuity, we validated the use of one of our specimen transfer tubes, one that is typically used with our ThinPrep Pap tests, for COVID testing. This helped total kit capacity catch up to our underlying production of reagents, and enabled us to ship millions of additional tests. And we validated a new sample collection and loading method that reduces the use of penetrable caps, a short-term constraint that we discussed last quarter. In terms of investment, we currently expect to spend over $50 million in capital to expand COVID production, with about $14 million of that spent through the third quarter. Some of this is being used to install new high-speed filling lines, and we are also investing in new, custom machinery to produce more penetrable caps. As announced this week, this effort is also being supported by HHS and DoD. In terms of brute force, we are producing 24/7 at our facility in San Diego. Employees from areas like IS and finance were trained to work on the packaging lines, while we hire over 150 new operations employees here, more than a 50% increase. We also expanded capabilities at our diagnostics plant in Manchester, United Kingdom, which began producing COVID tests at the end of June. Overall, these actions have provided the capacity to produce at least 1.5 million COVID tests per week, on average, and should enable COVID sales to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter, over and above our very strong Q3 even while accommodating higher volumes of our women\u2019s health tests. And there is the potential to do more if we are able to work through some remaining supply chain constraints on certain instrument components. The second point is that our diagnostic response to COVID will have short, medium and long-term benefits for Hologic as a whole. In the short-term, the benefits are obvious. Over the next several quarters, COVID testing will help drive strong overall corporate growth even before the base business fully recovers. In the medium-term, we expect that the record number of Panther and Panther Fusion instruments that we are placing now will turbo-charge our razor-razor blade business model, and dramatically increase pull-through of other assays. These include our new women\u2019s health tests, our quantitative virology products, and our respiratory mini-panels. To illustrate this, over the last several years, we have placed an average of 228 new Panther systems globally per year. In the third quarter alone, we placed 208 systems, 208. This was made possible by a significant expansion of production capacity at Stratec, and even by refurbishing more than 50 Panthers from our own research labs. At the end of June, our installed base stood at more than 2,000 systems, with almost 45% of these outside the United States. And over this fiscal year, we expect to place about 500 Panthers, more than doubling our recent, annual run-rate. Of the 152 systems shipped this quarter in the United States, we estimate that more than 60% will replace one of our older, workhorse TIGRIS systems over time. This will enable those customers to access our full menu of 16 FDA-authorized tests on Panther, rather than the 4 that are cleared on TIGRIS. The other 40% of systems either displaced a competitor, or enabled a new customer to begin testing. And some of these new customers are specifically targeting nascent growth opportunities such as home sample collection. One way we measure new customer adoption internally, as well as incentivize our sales force, is by tracking what we call TORs, or Tests of Record, and the contracted year-one revenue associated with them. A TOR is achieved when a customer goes live with a new assay on our system. In 2020, even as COVID is driving tremendous interest in Panther, our sales team has been focused on securing downstream revenue from other tests. Based on their excellent work and motivated by double the payout on non-COVID TORs, we have already set a record for TOR revenue. And we have even more signed and waiting to go live over the next couple of quarters. Since Panther was cleared in 2012, we have seen over and over again that as customers come to know and love the system, they adopt additional tests that drive even more pull-through, and we would expect the same dynamic to play out here. This will drive growth in the long term, even as multiple COVID vaccines are hopefully commercialized. While everyone at Hologic is rooting for successful vaccine development, it\u2019s important to note that the strength and duration of immunity still have to be established. And consumer surveys indicate that many people may choose not to be vaccinated. For these reasons, we also forecast there will be a long-term market for COVID testing on a global basis, just as testing co-exists with vaccines today for pathogens such as HPV, hepatitis B and influenza. The third point we want to make is that the strengthening of our international franchises over the years is enabling us to make a big difference in the fight against COVID today, which in turn will reshape our international businesses going forward. Let us give you a little more color on that. Over the last three years, international sales have been a major growth driver for the Company, with our base businesses growing at a low-double-digit CAGR organically. Within this, molecular diagnostics has been leading the charge, with growth rates often exceeding 20%. Underpinning this growth, we have invested methodically in our leadership and commercial infrastructure. We also divested Cynosure, which enabled our leaders to focus on the businesses they know best. For example, in our European region specifically, we had an installed base of about 220 Panthers in 2016, just before our regional president Jan Verstreken joined the Company. By the end of the third quarter, however, that number had doubled. By leveraging this installed base, our team has signed contracts in about a dozen countries that secure about $500 million of COVID testing revenue over the next four quarters, with opportunities to grow this further. The largest contract is with the UK Department of Health, which is worth nearly $190 million. While the vast majority of our COVID revenues in the third quarter came from the United States, expanding production capacity will enable us to serve more global customers going forward. In the third quarter alone, we shipped almost 60 Panther instruments to lab customers outside the United States. And like in the U.S., our commercial teams are capitalizing on the intense demand for COVID tests to drive pull-through of our other assays, which is a robust opportunity given our lower market shares globally. Before turning the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that the COVID-19 pandemic has really highlighted the importance of diagnostics within the healthcare system. In the future, we hope that this will lead to a strengthening of the public health infrastructure, more favorable reimbursement for diagnostic testing, and hopefully even more appreciation for the value of early detection, which is our core focus. At the same time, our response to the pandemic is also making Hologic a much more successful and influential player within the diagnostics industry, both domestically and overseas. This is based on the power of our technology and automation, and the ability of our people to quickly and effectively respond to public health needs. There is absolutely no doubt that our diagnostics division, and therefore our company as a whole, is becoming a stronger organization through this challenging time. Now, we\u2019ll turn the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I\u2019m going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, briefly touch on a few other key financial metrics, and finish by reinstating our financial guidance for the fourth quarter. Let me start by summarizing our third quarter results. Revenue of $822.9 million declined 3.1% due to the divestiture of Cynosure. Organically, we grew 8.1%, as strong sales of our COVID-19 diagnostic assays offset weakness in the rest of the business as a result of the pandemic. Profitability improved, with EPS of $0.75 increasing 19%, well ahead of our expectations. We entered the third quarter facing unprecedented uncertainty, and we acted prudently and decisively to reduce expenses and preserve cash. However, the hard work and ingenuity of our teams helped maximize the value of our two COVID assays, and the rest of our business is recovering better than expected. As a result, we generated strong cash flow in the quarter, which enabled us to repay $250 million that we had borrowed on our revolver as a precautionary measure. Our balance sheet and liquidity are stronger than ever. For all these reasons, we are optimistic that we are in position for a very successful fourth quarter. With that introduction, I will now provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. Diagnostics, our largest division, grew an outstanding 74.9% in the third quarter driven by molecular, where sales increased 170.3%. As Steve mentioned, in response to the unprecedented need for COVID testing, we increased our production capacity substantially in the third quarter. This enabled us to ship about 13 million COVID tests to customers, generating revenue of $324 million. Outside of COVID-19 testing, our base molecular and cytology businesses declined, but trends improved as the quarter went on. Breast health revenue was negatively affected by the pandemic, but the division performed in line with our expectations. Global breast health sales of $224 million decreased 30.9%. Excluding $3.9 million of sales from SuperSonic Imagine, sales decreased 32.1% organically. Demand for many of our products was negatively impacted by COVID-19, especially in the United States, as our customers focused on responding to the pandemic, delayed or reduced purchases of capital equipment, and rescheduled routine screening appointments. However, service revenue and international sales declined much less, cushioning the overall decline. In surgical, sales of $51.5 million decreased 53.9%, better than our internal forecast as the business has begun to recover more rapidly than anticipated. Weekly demand declined close to 90% early in the quarter as elective procedures were postponed. However, we saw steady, substantial improvement in May and more so in June. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $660.8 million increased 2.9% on a reported basis, as strong sales of COVID tests more than offset the impact of the Cynosure divestiture and reductions across our other product lines. But on an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 11.2%. Outside the United States, reported sales of $162.1 million decreased 21.2% on a reported basis and 2.8% organically. As you know, many countries began to emerge from the COVID pandemic earlier than the U.S. did, which helped our results. In addition, we began shipping our COVID-19 assays to our international customers in June, and expect these to be significant contributors to future growth. Moving on to the rest of the P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 64.7% increased 310 basis points, driven primarily by sales of COVID tests and the divestiture of the lower-margin Cynosure business. These benefits were partially offset by lower sales in our other divisions as a result of the pandemic. Total operating expenses of $261.1 million decreased 5.5% in the third quarter, driven mainly by the divestiture of Cynosure. However, expenses were significantly higher than our expectations entering the quarter, when we were planning for worst-case scenarios that thankfully never materialized. This was driven mainly by higher compensation expense, as accruals for incentive compensation increased in line with our financial results. In addition, we experienced higher than normal bad debt expense in the quarter, most notably a write-off associated with a change in a breast health distributor in Latin America. Lastly, we made a $10 million charitable contribution to the Company\u2019s donor-advised fund, and accelerated spending on some R&D and marketing programs to bolster future growth. Putting all this together, operating margin increased 380 basis points to 33%, and net margin increased 360 basis points to 23.7%, both recent highs. As a result, this led to non-GAAP net income of $194.7 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75, well ahead of our expectations. Before we cover our 2020 fourth quarter guidance, I\u2019ll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. At the end of the third quarter, our leverage ratio stood at 2.4 times, and we had $744 million of cash. Cash flow from operations was $223 million in the third quarter, a very strong result. Based on this cash flow, we repaid $250 million of debt under our revolving credit facility. We also believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of still-uncertain market conditions to pursue tuck-in acquisitions in each of our divisions. Our business development goals have not changed, we continue to look for deals that accelerate growth and deliver attractive economic returns, either by leveraging an existing commercial channel or helping us expand into near adjacencies. Finally, ROIC was 12.8% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 30 basis points. And adjusted EBITDA of $299 million increased 8.2%. Before we open the call for questions, I would like to discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. While our business environment remains uncertain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased that visibility has increased compared to last quarter. This is enabling us to provide quarterly guidance again, albeit in much wider ranges than usual. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect total revenue in the range of $925 million to $1,025 million. This represents organic revenue growth of 17.4% to 30.3% for the quarter. Due to the divestiture of Cynosure, revenue compared to the prior year period equates to an increase of 6.7% to 18.3% on a constant currency basis. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.95 to $1.15 in the fourth quarter. This implies growth rates of between 46.2% and 76.9%, significantly outpacing revenue. I\u2019d also like to point out that we expect other expenses net to increase to about $30 million in the fourth quarter, as we don\u2019t forecast gains related to certain investments that resulted from equity markets rebounding in the third quarter. This fourth quarter guidance is based on a full-year tax rate of 22.75%, and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 265 million for the full year. Now, let\u2019s turn briefly to our divisional expectations. In diagnostics, we expect that demand for our two COVID assays will continue to exceed supply in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. As Steve said, our efforts to increase manufacturing capacity should enable us to increase COVID sales compared to the third quarter level. And overall, we forecast that diagnostics revenue could double or more compared to the prior year period. In breast and skeletal health, recurring revenue such as service should continue to partially cushion a steeper decline in capital sales, reflecting the diversification strategy that we\u2019ve been pursuing for several years. Revenue should perform better outside the United States than domestically. We continue to believe that Breast Health will recover from COVID pressures more slowly than our other divisions. So, while fourth quarter results should be better than the third quarter, we still forecast that Breast and Skeletal Health revenue will decline in the range of 20% or more. In surgical, we believe revenue will continue to improve, based on both the clinical need for our products and the desire of our hospital customers to shore up their finances by addressing pent-up demand. However, there remains some uncertainty around the pace of this recovery, especially if COVID cases continue to spike in specific geographic regions and customers are forced to suspend elective procedures again. Overall, we expect surgical sales in the fourth quarter to be down around 20% compared to the prior year period. As you update your forecasts, let me remind you that macro uncertainty remains much higher than normal due to the virus we\u2019re all dealing with. That\u2019s why we\u2019re providing wide guidance ranges, and we would encourage you to model at the middle of these ranges, which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that Hologic\u2019s financial performance in the third quarter was excellent, and our financial condition remains rock-solid. As I look back, it\u2019s hard to describe how much our financial situation improved over the course of the quarter. For this we can thank an R&D team that quickly developed new COVID tests, and an operations and supply chain team that found a way to knock down just about every barrier to increased production. As Steve said, it\u2019s especially gratifying that we did well by doing good in the third quarter. What\u2019s more, we expect this performance to get even better in our fourth quarter. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks, guys. Steve, I\u2019m not sure where to start. You got through a ton of impressive numbers. So, congratulations on that. Steve MacMillan : Thanks. It\u2019s team effort. Patrick Donnelly : Yes, absolutely. I know, you kind of called out things can change quickly in these times. I certainly appreciate that. But, maybe looking ahead, can you talk through your views on the durability of testing into 2021? I mean, it certainly sounds like you\u2019re pretty bullish on the opportunity, but maybe we focus on the U.S. International, you kind of gave some good color there. But, you guys have obviously ran capacity nicely. How are you thinking about the setup into fiscal \u201821? I mean, it seems like demand is only increasing recently. You gave those numbers on June. Any reason to think, things don\u2019t continue to accelerate as we head into 1Q and 2Q next year? As you guys have talked about, 4Q certainly looks better than 3Q. Maybe just talk though the setup there from the testing side with the visibility we have today? Steve MacMillan : Sure. And again, Patrick, as you well know, hard to put long range forecasting, but here\u2019s the way we think about it. And it was really around the decision we made in March to double our capacity by the fall which when people first looked at it, it was not. Now, here\u2019s the simple reality. We\u2019re going to be going into a cold and flu season. I think every single person that sneezes or coughs from September through the next season is going to end up getting tested for COVID. And it\u2019s not just U.S., it\u2019s globally. And even all the talk of the vaccines, let\u2019s say a vaccine comes, there\u2019s still so many unknowns. There\u2019s also the fundamental reality that it\u2019s going to take months to get everybody vaccinated. Even after that people are going to be still getting this thing. And particularly on a global basis, we\u2019re not going to vaccinate the world. And there\u2019s only so long we can shut the world down and have people stay at home and not traveling and everything else. So, I think we really see this. Again, can\u2019t exactly quantify the magnitude. But you know what, I mean, look at all the universities, right, everybody needs to get back to work. Testing is the key area to help get people comfortable. So, I think, we see this at least going well through the next season. And beyond that, this thing is so voracious that we really believe there\u2019s going to probably at a bare minimum be an ongoing trail of testing just for prevalence or something else and population screening for at least another year or two. I mean, I think even Pfizer announced as it relates to a vaccine, they see a vaccine market continuing for years. So, we really see there a lot more durability there. Having said that, if it\u2019s not, we got our base businesses as well. But, fundamentally, we think this thing is going to be far more persistent than I think where a lot of people necessarily thought at the beginning. Patrick Donnelly : That\u2019s helpful. And maybe on the marketing side, can you just talk through expectations there? Obviously, you guys are investing a lot for areas like capacity expansion. And are you plugging money into other growth initiatives, just capitalizing again on these near-term tailwinds and big cash flow numbers et cetera? And then, quickly on the margin as well. Anything to call out on the profile of the international COVID testing, is that a bit lower just given how massive those orders are? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So, this is Karleen. So, a couple of things. So, yes, certainly, we are investing in capacity but also in our R&D, for sure, to accelerate future products. And on your point on ASPs outside of the U.S., yes, those will be a little lower than what we\u2019ve seen at this point in the U.S. Operator : We\u2019ll now take our next question from Chris Lin with Cowen. Go ahead. Chris Lin : Steve, in your prepared remarks, you stated that Hologic has increased manufacturing even more, if you can work through some of the supply chain constraints? Could you just help us understand what these constraints are? And if you are able to overcome them, how much would your manufacturing capacity increase over 1.5 million per week? Steve MacMillan : Sure, Chris. The constraints themselves go really through the supply chain. A lot of it\u2019s even things that get used on Panther itself. So, our ability to produce the test kits and everything else is good, but they\u2019re -- you\u2019ve seen some acknowledgment out there about pipette tip shortages and other things like that. Things that we don\u2019t control that we don\u2019t even supply to the vendors, they buy them directly. So, we\u2019re even working with manufacturers of some of the ancillary ingredients. And it\u2019s probably a little too early to sell. We think there\u2019s clearly a little bit of upside beyond the high end of our guidance, if we can crack these things. But, feel really good about the guidance we have. Karleen Oberton : Yes. And I would just add that if we think about increasing capacity, we\u2019re seeing our base business and diagnostics come back as well. So, it\u2019s going to be a challenge balancing on the two products. Chris Lin : Got it. And then, for my follow-up, I believe your Panther shipment forecast of 500 total placements in fiscal 2020 implies that placements declined sequentially in Q4 from the eight systems that you placed in Q3. If this is right, could you just provide a bit more detail on this decline? Is it a function of Stratec manufacturing constraints and depleting your refurbished research lab systems? And just looking ahead, can you give us a sense of the Panther instrument backlog? Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Sure. Chris, they will be a little bit lower. To your point, we said about 50 of those that we shipped were refurbished ones. So, they\u2019re all gone. We\u2019ve literally taken every one out of our buildings that we didn\u2019t have. We\u2019d also had a little bit of inventory coming into the quarter. So, we\u2019ve shipped -- as you can imagine, we shipped every last one. As I joked every time, there was a White House press conference and various customers or whatever were down there promising more volume, they came back in the next day, it\u2019s 1-800 Hologic, what else can you do for us? So, we drained everything that we had in inventory. We\u2019re building now certainly at about a double the rate, but it will be a bit of a sequential decline. But we got -- we made so much progress this quarter that that already sets us up well. Operator : We\u2019ll hear next from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Steve, there\u2019s been a lot of talk about pooling samples. Can you just talk a little bit about what you think pooling will do to Panther utilization? And then, any thoughts on flu test for legacy cancer to have a syndromic panel on the larger installed base? Steve MacMillan : Sure. Tycho, as you well know, as a leader in this space, we\u2019re so close to the FDA, to our customers and trying to help come up with solutions. I think, as it relates to pooling, we are working closely with FDA and with our customers to look at some claims and think that we\u2019ll be certainly a player in that space. And it may help increase the overall capacity, particularly in an environment right now where there frankly a lot more people that would still like to be tested. We think that may help. More on a testing where it\u2019s less diagnostic and more screening, I think there\u2019s going to be a ton of that come the fall with universities and everybody else trying to get back. So, we think there will become a place for pooling and it\u2019s something we\u2019re very familiar with really going back to our blood screening days. So, as it relates to a combo again, you can imagine, given our presence in this space, we\u2019re looking at combo products for the fall as well. We continue to hear from customers government -- COVID is going to be the primary need. I hate to say it, but we think this year that frankly when somebody gets flu, they\u2019re going to be relieved versus COVID is still going to be a bigger concern. But, we\u2019ll be there in all fronts. Tycho Peterson : And then, for the follow-up, just can you talk a little bit more about the women\u2019s health recovery? How you think about that beyond the fiscal fourth quarter? Mammography may start to come back. Is that more of a 2021 event, or could you see some uptick in the year-end? Steve MacMillan : Yes. I think, part of what we\u2019re not totally sure about yet, we\u2019ve seen a significant strengthening, certainly June, Julyish of both our surgical and women\u2019s health businesses and diagnostics. We think a chunk of that was catch up, people that delayed and kind of got rescheduled. So we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what the trajectory will be, particularly as you have any additional hotspots and this and that. But, I think overall, we feel pretty good about the progress there. And really, our Breast Health business, the diversification that we have in that business, so much more disposable and recurring service revenue and everything else. That is probably still going to be the slower climb out. But, we\u2019re seeing some real positive signs in that business as well. But, having said that, we\u2019re obviously forecasting, as Karleen said, still to be down somewhat in the current quarter and continuing probably to strengthen here over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Dan Leonard : A couple of questions on COVID, surprise, surprise. So, first off, Steve, you talked about the opportunity to use your COVID test to capture other test volume longer term. Can you elaborate on the mechanics of that? Is that contractual, and how confident are you that customers aren\u2019t acquiring Panthers with the intent to mothball in 12 months? Steve MacMillan : I think a couple of things. We\u2019re very confident and that many of them are contractually there, both U.S. and internationally. Internationally, we really link it very clearly into -- hate to say it, but we\u2019re providing you COVID tests, and there\u2019s a clear linkage to as the COVID volume goes away, we will fill the Panthers with our women\u2019s health assays. So, there\u2019s a lot of new customers that are going to be coming on board. The other fundamental reality that we see everywhere, and it\u2019s why as you see Hologic, we haven\u2019t been showing up at the press conferences, but we\u2019re clearly showing up in the marketplace. Everybody loves Panther. And the more that people use Panther, the more they want to use it. And by definition, the lab techs are constantly out screaming -- we\u2019ve got a number of governors call Kevin Thornal and say, you know what, I was just touring a couple of the labs in our state, all I keep hearing about is how great your Panther is. And so, that even experience there, I think we\u2019re seeing more and more people just getting experienced on it, and they love it. Dan Leonard : Okay. And then, for my follow-up, you talked about where the Panthers are going between TIGRIS competitive wins and some new customers, new to automated molecular diagnostics. That latter group, could you elaborate on what these customers look like? I think, you hinted at some nascent opportunities. But, really what does the demographic in this new to automated molecular diagnostic customer look like? Steve MacMillan : There\u2019s one that we had referenced, which is a company called LetsGetChecked, and they\u2019re doing a lot of direct to patient where they use our sample, they send it out, people send it back in and they\u2019re running it on our Panther. And while it certainly -- they were actually a nascent customer in with our base products, then as COVID came in, it\u2019s a real opportunity. We\u2019ve known several people, just locally have even used them. So, I think, those are examples of one that we\u2019ll be breaking out. Operator : We\u2019ll next take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian Weinstein : Steve, that was quite a door slam that you guys just did. So, congrats on that. Steve MacMillan : Thank you. Our Panthers were born to run. Brian Weinstein : Yes, they were. I appreciate that. But, not bad on your part, nice job. As we think about that 1.5 million per week here and all the demand that\u2019s there. You mentioned U.S., you mentioned OUS, and gave some details on those OUS supply agreements that you guys have signed? Do you need to increase the capacity in order to be able to -- to meet those U.S. supply agreements? And how are you sort of allocating this between the U.S. and the OUS at this point? Steve MacMillan : Yes. We do -- we\u2019ve only committed to what we know we can make. So, that 500 million number that we referenced over the next four quarters internationally is included in our production plans. If we can expand beyond that, we know there continues to be more business, both domestically and abroad. What\u2019s great is this is where, frankly, having our manufacturing facility in Manchester, UK, also, because that\u2019s our diagnostics facility for Europe. Again, just not -- it\u2019s not just San Diego but it\u2019s them cranking full out now and we really got them up and running in late June on the COVID test. Brian Weinstein : Okay. And then, if I could just kind of press on the previous question a little bit here, from the idea of the combo test. I wasn\u2019t sure if you were committing to being in the market before the proceeding and that that would be sort of a true combo test that would be COVID flu, or if you\u2019re going to get a flu test sort of approved on to Panther, then have kind of a way of doing flu and COVID by running two separate tests or just how you\u2019re thinking about kind of pursuing that and just to confirm, if you would be on the market you thought by the flu season or not? Mike Watts : Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Mike. I\u2019m going to take that one without the Springsteen reference, I think, sorry. So, just as -- a couple of things. One, just as a reminder, we have the ability to do multiple flu plus COVID on our fusion instrument today, as you know. So, that\u2019ll be an important part of the armamentarium. And we are developing a second test; it\u2019ll run on the Panther side that will combine flu with COVID. I\u2019m not going to speculate on when that\u2019s going to be available. Obviously that\u2019s impossible to predict. But certainly, the goal is to have it available for the fall flu season. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon. I\u2019ll continue on the diagnostic theme. I was curious if you could just comment on how you expect customers to use their Panther systems as the routine volumes start to improve, but the COVID testing sustains. Sorry, can you hear me? Steve MacMillan : Yes. Jack Meehan : Sorry. I thought I could hear something in the background. Yes. Just how you expect customers use the Panther systems? As the COVID testing sustains, do the routine volumes come back? And is there any cannibalization of the existing testing that you expect? Steve MacMillan : It\u2019s part of the magic, by the way, as you know, with the random access Panther. It\u2019s so easy to be able to run the women\u2019s health test, the COVID test simultaneously, not having to bash, not having to do all the other stuff that can slow stuff down. So, we really are seeing our key customers using it for both. And obviously, we are not going to short change our core business that we\u2019ve built this Company on, which is women\u2019s health. So, all of the numbers we\u2019re providing are continuing to do well within our women\u2019s health business, plus adding on that additional COVID volume. But, I think we see the customers being able to use both and it\u2019s part of the -- again it\u2019s part of the big magic in our system, as you well know. Karleen Oberton : And Jack, I would just add that, I think we had talked about prior to COVID that on average, a Panther was only 35% utilized. So, there was capacity already within that installed base to add additional testing. Jack Meehan : Great. And then, Steve, I was wondering if everything going on with COVID-19, if it changes your philosophy around M&A in the diagnostic space at all. Historically, I don\u2019t think you guys have looked at point-of-care as closely given your positioning in the hospital and regional labs. But, do you think it makes sense with the focus on early detection to push further that way? Steve MacMillan : Jack, great question. I would think you\u2019ll see us continuing or probably accelerating a little bit of our bolt-on strategy, probably with both, surgical as well as diagnostics, some things that we\u2019re looking and teeing up. And we think this is going to put us in a good position to acquire. Having said that, we also think there\u2019s -- there are clearly some lofty valuations that have been created within some of the space of diagnostics right now. So, we\u2019re also willing to be patient and certainly don\u2019t need to do anything, but I think it does give us more flexibility. And frankly, having Kevin Thornal out here running this business, as many of you know, Kevin work for several years in business development in his Stryker days, having him now running this diagnostics business and doing an amazing job of that. He also brings a deeper business development bolt-on mindset. And I can tell you, there\u2019s a lot more activity going on in the division with his leadership here. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Anthony Petrone : I had just a couple of math questions on some of the numbers you threw out here Steve and Karleen. And so, first thing would be, is the 500 million you referenced over the next four quarters for Europe, I guess, how much of that is baked into fiscal 4Q? Should we just expect that evenly loaded until a quarter of that goes into next Q? And then, how much is baked in there I guess for the fourth quarter for back to school? And you referenced it earlier, Steve, but that just strikes us as being a big driver next quarter. And then, last, just to get it in there, if we do it another way for looking at your production capacity, at a minimum, we\u2019re coming up with 400 million for just 4Q. Is that a good starting point when we think about the next 90 days? Steve MacMillan : Certainly, starting on the 500 million, which is an international number, that\u2019s called Asia Pac as well as Europe, it\u2019s primarily Europe, but just let me set the record straight there. I think, a good way to think about that is fairly level loaded over the next four quarters is kind of the way that the contracts are laying out. As it relates to back to school, we\u2019re clearly -- we\u2019ve been building and trying to ramp to get more and more production for this September-October period. So, I think that we\u2019re clearly seeing and expecting continued growth in this September timeframe. And that\u2019s what\u2019s baked into our guidance. Operator : We\u2019ll here next from Dan Brennan with UBS. Dan Brennan : So, Steve, I guess, could you help us think through maybe how you\u2019re thinking about where the market for testing goes? I think, you mentioned we\u2019re somewhere in the low-20s in the U.S. right now. Where do you think that goes by the fall? Any sense, and how you\u2019re kind of planning your business? And I\u2019d be interested to know if you could provide what your split is as well between U.S. I know U.S. COVID testing, because it\u2019s hard to get a sense of what the OUS COVID testing number is. Steve MacMillan : Yes. Well, obviously, we\u2019ve effectively given you a number in terms of, if you take that 500 million outside and divide it by 4 over the next four quarters, hopefully, it keeps you in the range of what the international component will be. Obviously, there\u2019ll still be more of it going to the U.S. as well. So, it\u2019s hard to exactly know where this market\u2019s going. But, I think when we were -- I remember being part of an AdvaMed call in -- geez, it was late April, early May, and they were saying that the country has the capacity to maybe do 400,000 tests a day maximum. We\u2019re now in that -- I love your report every day, 750,000 to 800,000 and we\u2019ve hit 900,000 a day. I\u2019d be surprised probably, if we\u2019re not at 1 million a day in that September timeframe. But again, we\u2019re -- obviously we\u2019ve gone -- the way I think about it as we went 5 million in April, 10 million in May, 15 in June. July is going to be over 20 million. It probably puts us on that pace to a 30ish million number of tests in the United States in that September timeframe, and I think, being very persistent as it goes through the whole cold and flu season. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you for that. And then, maybe just one more on vaccine. You kind of gave your -- some color upfront on some consumer survey stuff and kind of how you think about the persistence of testing, even when we have a vaccine in the market and we\u2019ll have to wait and see what the efficacy of it does look like. But, is the sense that -- I think you talked about a real persistent strength in \u201821. So, you talked about HPV and influenza. But, we were thinking too that there could certainly be a much higher vaccination rate, given the economic climate that this has caused. So, I think some investors worry that if we get an effective vaccine that the testing market could dry up rather quickly if there\u2019s like dramatically higher adherence towards getting it. So, anyway, it\u2019s hard to put the cart before the horse. But, how should we think about you think that persistence in the \u201821, which you talked about, when we begin to get some of this vaccine data out and what are some of the signposts for watching you think to see how strong and steady testing could be? Steve MacMillan : Yes. I think, think about it, particularly for the first half of \u201821, while the vaccine is rolling out, there\u2019s still going to be a bunch of people getting sick. And in the United States, by the way, you got what 350ish million people. And the big part that I keep coming back to because of all of our discussions and as a global enterprise, I think there has been so much focus on COVID in the U.S. We\u2019re not going to eradicate -- we\u2019re not going to vaccinate 7 billion people in the world. And given how persistent this is, just Vietnam, if you heard today, right, Vietnam had gone I think 90 days without any cases, and suddenly three popped up in Vietnam. So, I think there is going to be -- this is going to be circulating around the world. And again, exactly what that means -- none of us have the crystal ball. The CDC doesn\u2019t have it, the WHO doesn\u2019t have it. God forbid, I certainly and our team don\u2019t have it. But, I think just trying to use some common sense, thinking about the real realities, by the way, I mean if I\u2019m honest with you, who\u2019s going to likely get vaccinated first in the United States is probably going to be people who have a little more money, who are in the suburbs, and are we going to be getting the migrant worker population and a lot of the other folks that we really need to get where the persistence is bigger? Not sure we\u2019re going to get all of those people right away. So, I think there\u2019s going to be all kinds of reasons why this thing\u2019s still going to be out there. The other reality is, even though with the next five, six months before a vaccine comes, I think we\u2019re going to start to get better at realizing. And it\u2019d be helpful if some of the public officials would say, what we have to do is realize we\u2019ve got to live with this and learn how to cope and learn how to manage. And diagnostics is such a great tool to help people better understand where is it breaking out, what should we not do? And I think we\u2019re getting smarter and smarter, so that we don\u2019t go into complete lockdowns again and everything else. So, I think there is going to be all kinds of ways. If you\u2019re a university president right now, so many folks that need information that we\u2019re going to be helpful too to provide. Mike Watts : Operator, I think we can squeeze in -- we can squeeze in two more questions. Maybe we\u2019ll just limit these last two to one question each, please. Operator : We\u2019ll take the next question from Ivy Ma with Bank of America. Ivy Ma : So, I\u2019ll be quick on the question. So, I appreciate the color on the 40 million tests per quarter in terms of COVID capacity. So, I\u2019m curious, would you expect that one-four to one-third market share to persist in the next several quarters? And related to that, I mean, do you expect point-of-care to take share from what\u2019s currently being going on? And what percentage are you selling to hospitals or other facilities that might have some POC installed during this time? Steve MacMillan : That was good job, getting about 14 questions in there, Ivy. So, very impressive. Let me try to get as much of those answers as I can. First off, to clarify, the 40 million that we\u2019re building for production capacity is our total molecular volumes, of which clearly well more than half of that will be going pretty much towards our base business. So, I just want to make sure we didn\u2019t confuse and suggest that was a COVID production volume. In terms of market share, we\u2019re really not that focused on market share right now because I don\u2019t think any of us can provide. The real battle -- while we normally battle our competitors, the battle here is all of us battling this pandemic and battling coronavirus. So, I think there\u2019s going to be plenty of business for us going here. I think, as it relates to point-of-care, the point-of-care certainly has a role. But at the end of the day, super high volume, it\u2019s hard to test 1,000 people using point-of-care just from a manual -- the time that it takes. While it\u2019s quick to get one test back for one person, or you get four people tested, it\u2019s hard to do hundreds of people in a point-of-care world. And when you\u2019re as a country right now conducting the level of tests, 700,000, 800,000, 900,000 tests a day, you\u2019ve got to have high throughput, high volume systems to do that. So, I think, we\u2019re in one of those unique situations where point-of-care is probably going to continue to grow and we\u2019re going to continue to grow. Operator : We\u2019ll take our final question from Richard Newitter from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Richard Newitter : Thanks for squeezing me in here, and congrats on the quarter. Steve, if I could just maybe, on the non-COVID part of the business, specifically in your surgical business. Could you just elaborate a little bit on the trend, as you\u2019re exiting June and into July? I appreciate, you had mentioned some backlog work down or deferred procedures getting back on the schedule. But, is there -- what was the trend in the most recent two weeks? Was it improved from the exit rate coming out of June? And if you can talk a little bit on the actual new visits, de novo kind of visits, if you will, and what you\u2019re seeing anecdotally, in terms of patients seeking out care from that standpoint? Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Yes. Rich, we\u2019re not going to get into how the last two weeks were relative to other two weeks and this and that. I think it\u2019s baked into our guidance. We see our surgical business being down roughly 20ish percent this quarter. That\u2019s a dramatic improvement from the down 50% plus last quarter. I think, we like seeing a comeback. And then, we have some really good days and then you have Texas or Florida goes into a slight little lockdown again or whatever, and you see a little bit of things back. So, we don\u2019t have perfect visibility to the trend going forward, but we feel really good about the trajectory. We do -- to the second part of your question on new visits versus backlog, we\u2019re trying to track that and we\u2019ve got combinations of both a little more new. We don\u2019t have exact numbers. But clearly, MyoSure with its -- people have fibroid cases. That\u2019s going to be -- that\u2019s a lot of new and existing. And NovaSure, there was a little more catch-up initially. But, I think we\u2019re starting to see new patients coming back in as well. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions today.

Today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call. Mike Watts : Thank you, Christy. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. With me today is Steve MacMillan, the Company\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer, had an accident last week that required surgery, so she\u2019s not joining us today. She\u2019s resting at home and doing well, but I\u2019ll be covering for her in our call today. Please join me in wishing Karleen a speedy recovery. Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through November 27. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release, and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue. We define organic revenue as constant currency revenue less the divested Blood Screening and Cynosure businesses, as well as the acquired SuperSonic Imagine and Acessa businesses. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic\u2019s CEO. Steve MacMillan : Thank you Mike, and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re pleased to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We capped off a truly unprecedented fiscal year -- a year in which we made an enormous impact on public health with remarkable performance on both the top and bottom lines. Since we\u2019re marking the end of fiscal 2020, we\u2019ll reflect on the full year today. We also want to remind everyone of the steps we took in previous years that enabled us to post such terrific performance, and discuss how our current successes will make us an even stronger company going forward.  Before we do that, let\u2019s provide a quick overview of our financial results for the fourth quarter. Total revenue was $1.347 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.07. Revenue grew 70.9% organically, and EPS more than tripled, as higher production volumes in Diagnostics enabled us to leverage our fixed cost base. Both revenue and EPS came in well ahead of our expectations at the beginning of the quarter, as well as the updated guidance we provided in September. The outperformance was driven by unprecedented global demand for our COVID tests on the Panther system, and the continued recovery of our other product lines. How did we achieve these results? Five strategies that we pursued before 2020 put us in a position to seize the opportunities that COVID presented, as well as mitigate the risks. While we certainly did not predict the COVID pandemic, we did put in place people, processes and capabilities that enabled us to adapt quickly, make a massive contribution to human health, and drive value for customers, employees and shareholders.  First, over the last few years, we spent a significant amount of time defining our Purpose, Passion and Promise. As a reminder, our Purpose is to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day. Our Passion is to become global champions of women\u2019s health. And our Promise is the Science of Sure, which is all about providing clinically differentiated, high-performance products that customers and patients can rely on. These principles have inspired our team\u2019s incredible efforts over the last several months, especially our many front-line employees who have shown up to work every day since the pandemic began. When the world needs us most, our team rises to the occasion. Second, in diagnostics, we fueled our razor/razor-blade business model by placing hundreds of Panthers and strengthening our assay development capabilities to add more tests to our menu. At the end of 2014, we had about 600 Panthers installed worldwide. Over the next five years, we tripled that installed base to more than 1,700 at the end of 2019. Similarly, in 2014 we had a grand total of four assays approved on the Panther in the United States. But by the end of 2019, we had quadrupled that with 16 tests cleared. As a result, our molecular diagnostics business was thriving even before COVID, with growth of 11% globally last year. Clearly we were well-poised to make a difference when COVID emerged.  Third, in Breast Health, we diversified our business under the leadership of Pete Valenti. We recently announced that Pete will be retiring in December, and we want to thank him for more than six great years of service. Pete was the first division President I hired at Hologic, and he was the mastermind behind our Genius 3D mammography strategy. Pete leveraged our leadership position into a more diverse, consistent business that tracks the clinical continuum for breast health care. We acquired Faxitron, Focal and SuperSonic Imagine, grew our service business to be even bigger than our capital franchise, and developed innovative new products such as Brevera and artificial intelligence tools. As a result, our Breast Health division has been more insulated during the pandemic than many other businesses that are highly dependent on capital. Fourth, in Surgical, we brought in a new leadership team that quickly transformed the commercial organization with their focus on talent and engagement. This began with Sean Daugherty, who was recently promoted to Group President overseeing Surgical as well as Breast Health. Sean\u2019s team also revitalized the division\u2019s R&D pipeline, bringing to market new products including Fluent and the Omni hysteroscope.  As a result, Surgical was growing strongly pre-COVID, and is recovering faster than expected now. Fifth, in International, we hired experienced senior leaders who pursued an ambitious goal to double revenue over five years. In Europe especially, we moved away from distributors and strengthened our direct commercial capabilities under the leadership of Jan Verstreken, who was recently promoted to Group President for all our international franchises. Our International business grew 11% on average from 2016 to 2019, and when the pandemic hit, we were in an excellent position to contribute with our testing solutions. Now let\u2019s spend a few minutes on the highlights of fiscal 2020. What a year it was, with organic revenue growth of 22% for the year and highly leveraged non-GAAP EPS growth of 64%. In COVID time, when days feel like weeks and weeks feel like months, it\u2019s hard to believe that we sold our Cynosure medical aesthetics business early in fiscal 2020. The divestiture removed a drag on our growth and profitability, as well as an overhang on our stock. And behind the scenes, it helped us re-focus on our core businesses, especially overseas, which was critical when the pandemic hit. With the divestiture complete, we started 2020 in good shape. For the first time, all our major divisions and geographies were performing well. Organic growth had been steadily increasing, from a trough of about 2% in early 2018 to a solid mid-single-digit rate in early 2020.  Then COVID-19 changed everything. In the early days of the pandemic, we moved quickly to preserve cash and brace ourselves against the global macroeconomic shock. And at the same time, our diagnostics R&D team triggered what has become an incredible, division-wide response, one that exemplifies our purpose, passion and promise. Working around the clock, they developed our first COVID test for the Panther Fusion system in about two months. And as soon as our Fusion assay received its Emergency Use Authorization, we began working on a second test, an Aptima assay for our base Panther system that could run on more instruments and be produced in much larger quantities. Early on, in response to the massive public health need, we set a goal to double our overall molecular diagnostics production capacity, from about 20 to 40 million tests a quarter. A capacity expansion of this magnitude would normally happen over eight to 10 years, but we set out to make it happen in six months. As you can probably tell from our financial results this quarter, we have already exceeded this goal in terms of both size and speed. In the fourth quarter alone, we produced more than 50 million total molecular diagnostic tests. This included about 25 million COVID tests that we provided to customers, an average of roughly 2 million per week. This means we sold more COVID tests this quarter than we had ever produced of all our molecular tests in a quarter. While our efforts to increase production volumes have gotten a lot of attention, and deservedly so, we also want to highlight two areas that may be somewhat underappreciated. First is the impact we\u2019re making internationally, and second is the long-term durability of the COVID revenue opportunity. We\u2019re particularly proud of the role we\u2019re playing globally, especially in Europe. If COVID would have hit five years ago, our ability to make an impact would have been minimal, as we just didn\u2019t have the installed base, relationships or commercial capabilities. But now, under Jan\u2019s leadership, we are on track to generate more than $1 billion in total European revenue this year. As a major driver of this, the $500 million in committed COVID revenue that started in the fourth quarter is now expected to be over $600 million, and extend throughout fiscal 2021. The extension of these contracts reinforces that demand for highly accurate molecular COVID testing is going to remain robust for a while. Infection rates are on the rise not just in the United States but globally, and it will take time to manufacture and roll-out vaccines broadly, even if they are proven highly protective. Effective vaccines will eventually slow testing demand, but even then, we believe that COVID testing will remain a large market, probably bigger than any other molecular category, for years to come. Molecular tests have been the gold standard for infectious disease detection for decades, and for good reason. They are more accurate than other testing modalities, and this is especially important when lives and livelihood are at stake. And with our combination of robust chemistry, innovative engineering on Panther, and differentiated labeling from the FDA, we believe we are the gold standard among molecular tests. The data the FDA recently published, which compared the analytical sensitivity of more than 50 EUA assays, speaks to this point, and underpins the asymptomatic screening claims that we received for our COVID assays this quarter. Sensitivity is especially important when testing people without symptoms, when false negative results could provide a false sense of security and contribute to super-spreader events. So as we look forward, what will these accomplishments mean for our future? 2020 was a year in which we significantly strengthened the Company for the years ahead. Let me give you some examples. First, we shipped 511 new Panther systems this year, well more than double our run-rate over the last five years. This increased our global installed base to about 2,250, up almost 30% in just 12 months. We helped our manufacturing partner more than double production, and refurbished scores of instruments from our own and other labs. And we still have a waiting list for Panthers. We expect to have another very good year of placements in 2021, which reflects the longevity of COVID testing that our customers anticipate. The combination of our huge Panther installed base at facilities close to the patient, plus our assay sensitivity have us uniquely positioned to pursue opportunities that will be around for the long-term, such as testing before hospital admissions and asymptomatic screening. This is one reason we\u2019re moving ahead with further capacity expansion that will include our main plant in San Diego, our facility in Manchester, England, and several of our key suppliers of related consumables.  Our goal is to produce at least 75 million total molecular diagnostic tests a quarter starting roughly a year from now, which would represent more than 3.5 times our total capacity pre-COVID. These efforts will be reimbursed in part by the $119 million US government contract that we announced last week, which supports increased COVID production capacity for the domestic market. Clearly the government also believes that COVID testing is going to persist, and that we are making a meaningful difference against the pandemic. Second, the benefits of the new Panther placements will extend far beyond COVID. As we said in our last call, we are targeting Panther placements to customers who want to run our other tests when the pandemic is over. As a result, we are signing up record levels of new business, what we call TORs, or tests of record. To be more specific, in fiscal 2020 we signed up non-COVID TORs worth $35 million annually in the United States. This is almost 50% more new business than we had ever done in a single year, and helps explain why our non-COVID molecular sales increased slightly in the fourth quarter. In addition, we have another $35 million of non-COVID TORs waiting to go live as soon as we have product available and capacity on Panthers. The biggest contributor to these TORs has been the new Aptima vaginosis tests, which reinforces our long-term enthusiasm for these products. Overall, there is no question that additional Panther placements will make our molecular business markedly stronger over the next several years. Third, our contributions to fight the pandemic internationally have significantly elevated our market positioning, especially in major European countries including the United Kingdom, Germany and France. We are already seeing the benefits in terms of market access for other products and as we compete for tenders. Finally, the strong cash flow that our COVID tests generate is enabling us to strengthen our balance sheet and accelerate certain growth investments, as Mike will discuss. In addition, we are going on offense in two ways. First, we are stepping up our business development activities. In August, for example, we spent approximately $80 million plus future contingent earn-outs \u2013 to buy Acessa Health. Acessa markets a laparoscopic RF product that is used to treat fibroids that MyoSure can\u2019t reach, so it\u2019s very complementary to our surgical business and a nice fit for our sales force. Across our divisions, we have a full funnel of other acquisition targets today, and would be surprised if we didn\u2019t complete at least another deal or two in fiscal 2021.Second, we resumed our share repurchase program, buying back about 1.7 million shares of stock for roughly $100 million in the fourth quarter.  For the full year, we repurchased 13 million shares for $654 million, reflecting our confidence in the future. Before turning the call over to Mike, let me conclude by reiterating how proud we are of the Hologic employees who stared adversity in the face during 2020 and made remarkable contributions to the battle against COVID-19. Not only did our team make a huge difference on public health, we positioned Hologic for greater success in the future. Now we\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike. Mike Watts : Thank you Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I\u2019m going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, briefly touch on a few other key financial metrics, and finish with our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. As Steve said, we are thrilled with our fourth quarter results, as revenue and EPS significantly exceeded our guidance. Reported revenue of $1.347 billion increased 54% if you include the divested Cynosure business in the base. Organically, revenue grew 71%, driven by strong sales of our two COVID tests. Below revenue, the tireless efforts of our operations and supply chain teams to ramp up production of COVID assays boosted our margins, profitability and cash flow, as we leveraged unprecedented molecular diagnostic production volumes against our fixed cost base. As a result, EPS of $2.07 in the fourth quarter increased 218%, well ahead of our expectations. And cash flow was extremely strong as well, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. Diagnostics, our largest division, more than tripled in the fourth quarter driven by molecular, where sales increased 371%. As Steve mentioned, in response to the unprecedented need for COVID testing, we shipped about 25 million COVID tests to customers, generating revenue of $601 million. It\u2019s important to note that even if you exclude COVID-19 testing, as well as COVID-related ancillaries and equipment, our base molecular business increased in the mid-single-digit range. This speaks to the clinical importance of our assays as well as the bright future we have in molecular, as new products contribute more and more. Rounding out our diagnostics division, the cytology and perinatal businesses declined, but trends improved compared to the third quarter. In Breast Health, divisional performance improved a little faster than we expected. Global sales of $289.2 million decreased 16.2%. Excluding $6.2 million of sales from SuperSonic Imagine, sales decreased 18.0% organically. Demand for many of our capital products was obviously depressed by COVID-19, but as Steve discussed, the increasing diversity of our business cushioned the overall decline, as consumables and service essentially returned to their pre-COVID levels. For example, our interventional business was basically flat, helped by the relaunch of our Brevera biopsy system late in the quarter. And service revenue which was larger than capital sales grew slightly. In Surgical, sales of $100.2 million decreased 12.9%, also better than our internal forecast. Demand for semi-elective procedures continues to be negatively impacted by COVID-19, but trends definitely improved compared to the third quarter, and our customers are reporting a steady increase of new patients, which bodes well for continued recovery. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $994.9 million increased 52% on a reported basis, as strong sales of COVID tests more than offset the impact of the Cynosure divestiture and reductions across our other product lines. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 64%. Outside the United States, sales of $352.1 million roughly doubled on a reported basis and grew 95% organically, driven by excellent performance in Europe. Now let\u2019s move on to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 74.2% increased 1,250 basis points, driven by sales of high-margin COVID tests and the divestiture of the lower-margin Cynosure business. As a further benefit of the Cynosure sale, total operating expenses of $276.6 million decreased 1.0% in the fourth quarter, despite growth in core Hologic R&D, the addition of SSI expenses, and opportunistic investments we made to bolster future growth. Some examples include marketing campaigns to improve healthcare equality for underserved communities, and to emphasize the importance of preventive screening during the pandemic. We also outsourced some diagnostics R&D work to third parties and accelerated product registration efforts and clinical trials in some of our international regions. Finally, we had higher compensation expense, as accruals for incentive compensation \u2013 especially in Diagnostics increased in line with our financial results. Putting all this together, operating margin increased 2,430 basis points to 53.7%, and net margin increased 2,020 basis points to 40.4%, both record highs. As a result, non-GAAP net income finished at $543.7 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.07, well ahead of plan.  Before we cover our 2021 first quarter guidance, I\u2019ll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Driven by demand for our COVID tests, cash flow from operations was $442 million in the fourth quarter, a very strong result. For the full year, cash flow from ops was almost $900 million. And even with significant capital spending in Diagnostics to support increased COVID production, free cash flow was $740 million in fiscal 2020.This strong cash flow gives us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility, and enabled us to further strengthen our balance sheet in two ways. First, we repaid $250 million that we had borrowed on our revolver as a precautionary measure early in the third quarter. Second, we refinanced $950 million of senior, unsecured notes, lowering our interest rate from 4.375% to 3.250%, which we believe is the lowest ever for a high-yield healthcare bond. And we also pushed out the maturity four years, to 2029. Overall, we had $701 million of cash at the end of the fourth quarter. And with more than $1.5 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, our leverage ratio fell to 1.5. We do expect both EBITDA and free cash flow to grow significantly in fiscal 2021, but as Steve said, we are actively pursuing a number of acquisitions across our divisions to accelerate growth, and hope to use our cash flow to complete a couple of deals this year. Finally, ROIC was 18.5% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 550 basis points. Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We anticipate that fiscal 2021 will be an excellent year for Hologic overall, but our business environment remains very fluid due to the pandemic. Therefore, we are only providing a single quarter of guidance today. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect excellent financial results again, even a little better than last quarter despite the slow-down we usually see around the holidays. We forecast total revenue in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.425 billion. This represents organic revenue growth of roughly 71% to 81%. Including Cynosure in the prior year period, our guidance corresponds to reported growth of 59% to 68%, and constant currency growth of 57% to 65%. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $2.10 to $2.25 in the first quarter. This implies unprecedented growth rates of between 244% and 269%, significantly outpacing revenue. This first quarter guidance is based on a tax rate of 22.75%, and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 263 million for the quarter. Now let\u2019s turn to our divisional expectations. We forecast that Diagnostics revenue in the first quarter could triple or more compared to the prior year period. Underpinning this, we expect that demand for our two COVID assays will continue to exceed supply this quarter. As Steve said, we are further expanding production capacity for our molecular tests, but most of this capacity will come on-line later in 2021. Based on this timing, we forecast COVID assay sales to increase slightly in the first quarter compared to the fourth, commensurate with a small sequential increase in production. We also expect that our combination test for COVID and flu, which we submitted for a EUA last week, will be available later this quarter. We anticipate sales in both Breast and Skeletal Health and Surgical to be down again in the first quarter, although with slightly better percentage declines than in the fourth quarter. In Breast and Skeletal Health, let me remind you that first quarter sales often decline sequentially in absolute dollars compared to the fourth quarter due to seasonality around the holidays.  And in Surgical, we believe our customers are much better-prepared than they were in the spring to manage through local increases in COVID prevalence. So while we do expect trends to continue improving, we will keep a close eye on whether increasing COVID cases have a negative effect on elective procedures. As you update your forecasts, let me remind you that macro uncertainty remains higher than normal due to the pandemic. While our visibility has improved compared to several months ago, we would still encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides.  Before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic\u2019s financial performance in the fourth quarter was tremendous. I have no doubt that our efforts this year have significantly strengthened the company for the long term. We continue to make a huge impact on human health globally, and have positioned ourselves to deliver an exceptional fiscal 2021 as we continue to battle a virus that isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, and then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First, we'll go to Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. VijayKumar: Hi, Steve. Congrats on the solid year. Good to be back on the call here. I guess -- maybe I guess the comments you made on M&A, Steve, if I just step back, there's a $1 billion of COVID revenues we weren't expecting a year ago, it's likely to be in at least one and a half plus of incremental revenues coming in over the next 12 months. And these are; revenues are dropping down at pretty high margins, 65% -70%? That's a lot of free cash. When you think of following those -- the proceeds? I think you mentioned one or two deals in the near term. Could you maybe talk about perhaps the focus? What areas are you looking at? Are these going to be both focused in acquisitions, perhaps on the size of the transaction deal? SteveMacMillan: Sure, Vijay. I think what's great as we've really gotten back to our division led business development strategy. So we've got each division out there, that way they know the adjacencies, the ability to bridge out, I would say if you go forward, we're clearly looking at some ways to broaden our diagnostics platform, both product wise as well as geographically. So that team has been very active on the business development front. In addition, obviously, to all the production capability and everything else, but we're looking across the board, surgicals continues to look at some additional things. And breast health is looking at some things as well. But I think diagnostics is probably more likely to be where we see it. I do think we've kind of set up the rough principle of staying within the constraints of our annual cash flow. And I think that continues to be exactly what we're thinking about, we're looking at some things that might be a little bit bigger than we were looking at pre COVID but nothing beyond certainly beyond the annual cash flow or anything like that. VijayKumar: Understood. And then, Mike, maybe one on, I guess, the label extensions here to asymptomatic. Is this now indications perhaps given asymptomatic label that we could see in testing strategies, and beyond the next six months, as you look back half of next fiscal perhaps once we have the vaccine. Could you maybe just address what happens to testing post vaccines and perhaps the durability of testing in the context of your asymptomatic labeling? SteveMacMillan: Vijay, glad you picked up on that, which is we believe this asymptomatic approval is an enormous win for us over the long haul. And let's face it with what the world has gone through here, even post vaccine, there is going to be probably some pretty strong ongoing needs by governments around the world, who want to monitor their health -- their populations, and just track on an ongoing basis, just to see relative incidence or any kind of recurrences. And frankly, it's the asymptomatic people who are the key there. And that's the on label indication; it's hard for us to probably fully underscore how strong we think the demand will be for that for years to come. Yes, and you still play out the timing of vaccines, by the way, let alone mutations and other things. We believe and we've been in close contact with most of the major governments around the world, all of the key labs, the health experts, we believe an ongoing screening program, where you're going to want to use the most sensitive tools out there, including, frankly, hospitals are going to want to continue to test patients coming in, what is the best way everybody is going to go in for a hip and knee, cardiac any other procedure, we think, at least for the next couple of years, is probably going to be tested. And again, with our global installed base now in excess of 2200 and continuing to grow on Panthers. We think this is going to be a big, big, enduring market for us, is it going to be exactly what it is today? Yes, likely not. But there's going to we believe, and we've made the bet that there's a longer tail. if you look, by the way, just one other data point, the contract we got from the US government last week, if you look at it, they're asking for us to be providing 13 million tests per quarter, by per month, really six quarters from now by the first quarter of 2022. So again, governments are increasingly planning to want to have major capacity well beyond even just this coming, cold and flu season. Operator : Next, we'll go to Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. TychoPeterson: Hey, good afternoon. I'll start with one for Mike and Mike, nice job wearing CFO hat, hope all is well with Karleen, but I want to ask about operating margins, that 2,430 basis points of margin expansion. The real question is how sustainable is that, and if we do the run rate on the EPS guide for the year that gets you to kind of $9 at the high end? Is that the right way to think about it? Or is there some reinvestment? That we need to think about over the course of the year? MikeWatts: Yes, sure Tycho. So operating margins, obviously, were very strong in the quarter, based on the COVID revenue and just higher revenue overall, we did guide for revenue to be a little bit higher sequentially in Q1 versus Q4, margins gross and operating should be about the same maybe a little bit better, based on the higher revenue. So we should be looking at another, strong quarter of EPS in Q1, I think that corresponds to the guidance we gave at the bottom line, which was a little bit ahead. I think we guided to $2.10 to $2.25, for EPS, so that should all be pretty consistent. Certainly I would be cautious about kind of taking that level and just analyzing it. I think that, as Steve said, we feel very strongly that we're going to get very healthy demand, at least through the March quarter, right? As flu kind of hopefully goes away around that time. I think from that point forward, you're likely to see overall COVID revenue start to decline on a sequential basis, but I think it's going to be pretty gradual. Steve talked about some of the drivers of long term demand. So I think that maybe we peak in our March quarter, maybe we peak in the June quarter, but things will likely decline on a sequential basis from there, and that will have an effect on EPS as well. TychoPeterson: Okay, that's helpful. And then for Steve, a couple quick hits on the testing side. You've been pretty negative on the pooling front. I'm just curious if you think as we head into next year pooling starts to pick up and then on the government contract, are that a one off in your view, or could there be other kind of chunky government contracts like that to support scale up. And then lastly, I'm just wondering if you could comment on the non COVID testing volumes up in single digit, which is certainly better than we've been expecting. So I'm curious about the sustainability of that. Thanks. SteveMacMillan: I think Tycho just set a world record for the one follow up, that was three or four. So let me make sure I try to get all of those Tycho. On the pooling, we think eventually that will start to kick in. And again, if you look at the way we're poised and because of the extreme sensitivity of our task, we feel like we're poised no matter where this goes. And by being able to offer to customers if it ends up going into a pooling world, we are there for them. And certainly, years in the future, we wouldn't be at all surprised if there's still some level of ongoing testing that probably would use pooling, certainly more I don't -- we don't see much interest, frankly, and given the still that the very high incidences don't see that, being as much right now. What were the other parts of the -- TychoPeterson: Government contract? Is that a one off? Could there be other? SteveMacMillan: Yes, thank you. On the government contract side, I think this largely covers the bulk of the expansion that we had both planned and then did encourage us to even go that much higher on, where we're going, we are getting to that $75 million a quarter number. MikeWatts: And I think Tycho the last question was related to diagnostics volumes, non COVID. And I think they're, we were encouraged in the quarter, by growth in the base, HPV had a good quarter, trichomonas had a good quarter, continue to get good traction with our HIV viral load product, particularly in Africa, doing a good job there, I think we called out in our script, a lot of good interest around our vaginosis panel, which is CV/TV, which has contributed to the growth as well. So it was nice to see even if you back out all the COVID stuff, which obviously was huge. The underlying business grows as well in the quarter. Operator : And next, we'll go to Patrick Donnelly from Citi. PatrickDonnelly: Great, thanks, guys. Steve may be one for you -- may be just one on the capacity side. Certainly appreciate it's going to take some time to expand that. Can you just talk through I guess the key hurdles you need to get through for that and any potential for a larger increase even this quarter? I mean, similar last quarter, I know you said you had some things to break through to get the capacity going in fiscal 4Q, you did that. Maybe just talk through how this trends over the next couple of quarters and any potential again to pull that capacity expansion forward on the COVID side? SteveMacMillan: Yes, I think the way to probably think about capacity is it's not a steady linear. It comes as pieces of equipment, and suppliers can come in. So I, we were able to get a few that we had a bunch of stuff ordered early in the year, a number that came through now it's sort of making the investments for the future, Patrick, that for example, this quarter, next quarter, not much additional capacity coming online, including things like multi tube units and pipette tips and all the ancillary consumables, where we are giving additional investment to our suppliers to put in new machines, but they've got to now order those machines. So we're sort of in the next wave of placing the orders where they won't be coming online for another six or nine months-ish. And, therefore, it's much more incremental here in the immediate quarter. But we are continuing to position ourselves for further out. Hopefully, that helps. But it kind of goes up in sort of straight lines, it's more of a stair step, I guess, than a linear progression. PatrickDonnelly: Yes, makes sense. And then there'd be one on breast health, certain held up better than anticipated on our end. Can you just talk through the key pieces of performance there? And then the outlook, you're heading into even calendar 2021. You always seem to have a pretty good handle on hospital CapEx and spending outlook. Maybe just your two cents there that would be great. SteveMacMillan: Yes, I think the great part when you think about our breast health business today is we probably think about it as three chunks, you got the capital of the core mammography, we've got the service piece, which has become so much bigger, and then a much bigger disposable business, that Pete and the team really have built out so it's instead of a one legged pony of gantries, and then it's also much more international. So if I play it out overall service is holding up pretty well. The disposable businesses including the Provera launch now looking good. Frankly, a lot of the European countries didn't dip down quite as much initially, we don't have as much service business over there, but we've got those businesses. So then you come back to the core capital piece. And I think our teams, particularly the US are feeling fairly encouraged. And even frankly, around the world, we're getting, even into some new countries, we've had reached out to us recently, I mean there, so I'll go there, and then come back, the fascinating part is, the more we're having discussions about COVID revenue with a lot of countries around the world, they're becoming much more aware of Hologic overall. And so we've actually been selling some gantries into some countries. So it's going to help the breast health business over time, this and that, back to the piece in the US, I think our teams are cautiously optimistic that they feel like they're back having good discussions, our order patterns are getting a little healthier. And so I think we're still suggesting we'll be down a bit this quarter, but probably down less this quarter than we were just in that they called 16 percentage down this past quarter. So I think overall, and as we look to 2021, we're probably anticipating each quarter just gets gradually better. As hospitals and particularly the focus on women's health, it's not lost to us by the way, and we're kind of encouraged that the new senate and house will have more women than they've ever had. And what's been fascinating through the course of this year too, we've got to know a lot more of the governors, Kevin Thornal, on a first name basis; we're probably half the governors in this country, and everybody else. So we've got relationships that will continue to, I think, help us even on women's health issues and wanting to make sure people are getting back to mammography screenings and cervical cancer screenings. Operator : And next, we'll go to Dan Leonard from Wells Fargo, your line is open. DanLeonard: Thank you. So on molecular, given their capacity now seems pretty static at that 15 million test level, how are you managing the trade offs between serving COVID demand in your core molecular demand now that that's coming back? And what are you assuming in your Q4 guide? Or Q1 guide, I am sorry, December quarter? SteveMacMillan: Yes, I know, our fiscal year always kind of gets a little scary there, Dan, we are doing everything we can to make sure that we do produce all of our women's health as all of our core assay, there were, a couple of weeks here or there were just components, because it's a shared supply chain that we ran into a couple of back orders on certain products. But overall, right now, our guiding philosophy through all of this is we take care of our core business, and then we add COVID on top. So I think we feel pretty good with the 50-ish million that we're at right now that we can deliver. Certainly, if you figure we were in the 20 million to 21 million, a quarter of non COVID stuff back two or three quarters ago, we can handle some growth on that core, and then still have that 25-ish million of COVID volume to do. So I think we're assuming this quarter is just marginally above what we did this last quarter on molecular. DanLeonard: Okay, and then just secondly on the share repo, seems like you were pretty opportunistic on the repo in the fourth quarter. How were you thinking about it in the first quarter and beyond? I mean, if you expect there could be continued market volatility? Would you take a more opportunistic approach towards repurchasing shares or more methodical? Thank you. SteveMacMillan: Sure. Great point, Dan. We have the ongoing debate about being more methodical versus opportunistic. And we probably end up a little bit in between, I think, with the cash we're going to be generating our first priority is still going to be judicious acquisitions. But I think with the cash we're generating, and as we continue to look at our own stock, having confidence that acquiring a company that we know a lot about i.e. ourselves is also not a bad deal. So it'll probably be a bit of both methodical and opportunistic going forward. Operator : And next we'll go to Chris Lin from Cowen. ChrisLin: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. And I hope Karleen is doing well. SteveMacMillan: She's listening and she's going to be sending us a grade probably telling us not to mess it up. ChrisLin: Well, I think Mike is filling in pretty well. Anyway, can you just -- can you talk about how many Panthers you expect to ship in 2021? Is it possible for you to ship another 500 or so? Or should we think about a figure that's south of this level, but north of a typical 200 to 250 run rate? SteveMacMillan: Chris, you have just answered your own question, I think, probably somewhere between the typical 250 and the 500. I don't know that we'd get full 500 just given, that was a massive influx of orders, but I think it will be well north of the 250. So not totally sure. But I'd probably feel comfortable splitting the difference. At this point, probably in that north of a 350-ish number, probably call it a 350 to 400 is probably a reasonable place to be. And I would say if demand continues to persist. Then it might be able to go a little bit north of that. But, even with where we are, if we do another 350 to 400 this year that will have been almost a 50% increase in two years of our entire global install base. And I do think that's the big part that is not fully appreciated. ChrisLin: Understood. And for a somewhat well, unrelated follow up, can I just go back to a prior question on M&A. So diagnostics is clearly your, one of your strongest franchises, and you have extensive foothold in many laboratories with Panther systems. So I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on why there isn't too much M&A focus in this segment. Thank you. SteveMacMillan: Well, I think as we see, we've got a great commercial presence certainly in the labs and in the in the hospitals around the world. So I think obviously continue to add menu and continue to add Panthers is great. But ultimately I think what we're starting to look at is, hey, look, we can build a stronger diagnostics platform that may have some other technologies. And I don't want to get much more specific, because that could lead to speculation or specifics. But I think with Kevin Thornal, who has a nice business development background from his Stryker days, now leading the diagnostics division, and it's been amazing what he has done, obviously, just from an operational standpoint, what you wouldn't see is he's also been very busy on the business development front as well. And we've actually walked away from some deals based on valuation even over the last few months, since he's been here, so he's completely changed the flow of ideas that's coming forth to us. And therefore, I think we'll probably make some things happen. But if we're going to remain disciplined, we're not going to get silly just because we have more money flowing in. Operator : And next we'll go Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. JackMeehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. Steve, it would be great maybe just to start to get your thoughts on combo COVID and flu testing, do you think the market could shift meaningfully as we hadn't been preparing the flu season from COVID Only? And what would be the implications for Hologic from a financial perspective? SteveMacMillan: Sure, we're continuing to be in very close touch with our customers and everything else. And obviously, we expect to be launching in this quarter of the combo test. I think that the much bigger concern right now continues to be COVID itself. And when you look certainly at the southern hemisphere, where there's been very little flu season, if you think about all the mitigation measures in the US of social distancing, and mask wearing and everything else, I think there are a lot of experts that will think we may have a very mild flu season. And the most important thing, frankly, right now that the bigger concern continues to be flu, I'm sorry, I continued to be COVID. But I think we'll see bits of both and we're basically preparing in our supply chain to be able to toggle as to whichever our customers will want. But there's, it's funny, as we've just been out caucusing them. There's still been a relentless focus really on just the COVID assay at this point in time. JackMeehan: Great. And can you just talk a little bit more around how pricing is trending? It seems like from the stats you threw out about revenue and volume. It was pretty stable in the quarter but do you view that as durable and would pricing change if you -- with the COVID combo test? SteveMacMillan: Sure, I think we're seeing relatively very stable pricing actually globally, right now on COVID. And certainly the combo would be likely priced higher. And I don't want to get into specifics depending on reimbursement or everything else. But at this point in time, pricing has remained very steady. I think that we'll continue to track a little bit whatever happens to reimbursement in the future. And this and that, I think over the long run, we will be wise, we certainly plan that there will be some degradation in pricing over time, but feel very good about the nearer term of how it's holding up. We also and you were on top of it, but the reimbursement change that came down in the US recently of lowering, that the base price from $100, down to $75. But providing the $25 up charge, if the patient can get the results returned within 48 hours is very beneficial to us, given our footprint of around the country. So I think again our ability to help labs and help hospitals, return the results quickly plays to our strengths as well. MikeWatts: That also contributes to the continued demand for more Panthers more boxes as well. SteveMacMillan: Yes. MikeWatts: Operator, I think we have time for maybe one or two more questions. Operator : Next, we'll go to Brian Weinstein from William Blair. BrianWeinstein: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. So to ask a political question, I guess. I mean, we've seen a lot of funding for testing under the Trump administration. So we know what that looks like. But if we do see a Biden administration take over in January, what do you think that means for testing in general, for funding for reimbursement or even anything with the FDA? I'm just curious if you have thoughts on kind of his broader COVID-19 strategy that he's outlined? SteveMacMillan: Yes, I think it's hard to believe that it wouldn't be neutral to positive and more likely, potentially more testing. So I think the bigger, the bigger risk would have been Republicans maybe wanting to cut back. So I think, but I also think there's such an inexorable force of the consumer. And, frankly, state and local governments and companies and everybody that will also continue to drive this, but I would consider Biden to be a net positive for us. BrianWeinstein: Got it. And then in today's weekly afternoon, Town Hall, there was some discussion from one of your employees about giving some language chose for testing to kind of expand beyond just saying the PCR to molecular to kind of cover your technology, as well as that's something that is causing any kind of a headwind in the market? FDA clearly seem to be amenable to changing anytime they're like on the call, but is that anything that you guys have seen as being problematic in any way? MikeWatts: Yes, Brian, it's Mike. I mean, I think if you look at our sales performance, the answer would be no. Clearly, PCR is a little bit like to become a little bit of a term like Kleenex or something to be synonymous with paper tissues and such. And that's fine. Obviously, we use a different technology that's been competing against PCR for decades it's called TMA. And it really hasn't had an effect. I mean, look at the uptake of the products and TMA has been used, has been leading the Chlamydia gonorrhea market for decades, HPV, et cetera. I think the specific issue that came up was related to travel between the states and what would qualify for a test or whatever, but I think that's fairly inconsequential. I think we'll get that stuff resolved. MikeWatts: Operator, maybe one more quick one. Operator : We'll go next to Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. RajDenhoy: Hi, good evening. Hi, Steve and Mike and -- Karleen as well. Mike, maybe actually, Steve, I should ask you this question. So prior to COVID, your average Panther was doing something on the order of $240,000 to $250,000. It's now well over $1 million maybe close to $1.5 million, when we start to think about the sustainability of this business, right. I think what people are trying to figure out is where that goes. You've given us some detail on your thoughts there but maybe to put a finer point on it, a year from now, what do you think your average Panther is going to be generating in terms of revenue? SteveMacMillan: Yes, I think, Raj, as you well know it was kind of increasing in a high single digit, almost double digit rate per Panther. Exactly what where it will be, will be so dependent a year from now as to how much COVID testing, what's the COVID pricing? But, clearly, it just continues to go up. And with our broader menu, 16 approved tests, and actually now with the two additional COVID ones, were at 18, just more and more to be able to put through, I probably don't want to, it'd be premature to spec -- to try to give you an absolute number as to where that will be. But I think we just feel great that there'll be more volumes of more tests and more Panthers. And so collectively just driving higher. MikeWatts: Yes, maybe to add to that, Raj, just for a second, I mean, to put a fine point on. We mentioned in the script, this concept of TORs, which is one thing that we look at a lot internally, we signed in this past year, TORs representing more than $35 million of year one revenue. To give you a sense, I mean, that's more than 50%, more than we've ever done in a year before. And in addition to that, there's another 35 million of TORs kind of waiting in the wings, for when we have capacity on the Panthers as well as, product availability. So a lot of good excitement around some of our new tests in particular, and I think that's going to contribute to continued steady growth in that pull through. RajDenhoy: Helpful. And maybe just lastly, Steve, one quick one just your updated thoughts, maybe on rapid or point of care tests, any deputy thoughts in your desire to get into that business or your views on that? That segment of diagnostics? SteveMacMillan:  Yes, great question, Raj. We are really, we've got an incredible group of scientists in this company that and from the very outset, myself, Kevin, you kind of challenge different ways of thinking and looking at all of these different things. And we are staying very close to our core of really having the best products. When you think about what we do in 3D mammography, what we have with NovaSure, MyoSure, what we've always had in our molecular portfolio, really wanting to make sure that we have the best products with the best of labels. And, candidly, there's a lot of point of care stuff right now that I would say is being used off label, particularly being used for screening when it's not supposed to be and over time I think right now, there's a little bit of a wild west component where people are just, making money selling tests, getting them out there and saying, hey, run a bunch, whether they're accurate or not, if you test enough, it'll work. I think over time, the cream always rises to the top. And there will like in any market, things will settle out. And I think as things settle out, the superior products with the best labels, testing the right people in the right way at the right time will prevail. And I think we feel really good about that. We've looked at, we've had you can imagine through distribution agreements, we've had a lot of opportunities to frankly even drive more short term revenue by offering other products through our incredible sales channels. And really, you're staying away from it, because we want to make sure that we don't do anything to dilute our long term brand equity and want to stay really close to the science. So thank you for asking that. Operator : And thank you that is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",

My name is Edwardo, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute.  I\u2019d now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call. Mike Watts : Thank you, Edwardo. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the Company\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session today. Our first quarter press release is available now on the investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through February 26. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that\u2019s included in our earnings release, and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue, and we define organic revenue as constant currency revenue excluding the divested Blood Screening and Cynosure businesses, as well as the acquired Acessa business. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic\u2019s CEO. Steve MacMillan : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We are off to a very strong start to the year across all our businesses and major geographies.  Once again, our Diagnostics division delivered incredible performance by making a massive impact against COVID-19. And our Breast Health and Surgical businesses continue to strengthen, with each returning to growth in the United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific. So our performance was strong and broad-based across both divisions and geographies. As a result, our financial results were exceptional in the first quarter. Let\u2019s provide a quick overview. Total revenue was $1.61 billion, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.86. Organic revenue more than doubled, up 104%, while EPS increased more than four-fold, as higher production volumes in Diagnostics enabled us to leverage our fixed cost base. Both revenue and EPS came in well ahead of our expectations at the beginning of the quarter.  With that introduction, I\u2019d like to cover three main topics in my remarks today, which will echo some of the themes from our presentation at the JPMorgan conference earlier this month. First, how our purpose-driven culture is contributing to, and we believe driving our excellent financial results; second, how we\u2019re making a huge difference in the fight against COVID-19; and third, why we\u2019ll be a stronger company on the other side of the pandemic. To begin, many of you will recall that Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, wrote in early 2018 that companies both public and private, should serve a social purpose. Three years later, we would argue that Hologic is the epitome of such a company. We are an incredibly purpose-driven, highly engaged team that is waking up every day wanting to make a positive difference in the world. And we believe this culture is contributing to differentiated financial performance, both in terms of our COVID response and the faster-than-expected return to growth in our Breast Health and Surgical divisions. Our employees understand that the bigger our collective impact on the world, the more they and our shareholders benefit. What makes us tick is our strong purpose of enabling healthier lives everywhere, every day. Within this, we have a special passion to champion women\u2019s health. But we don\u2019t just help women. If, for example, you\u2019re one of the tens of millions of people who have had a Hologic COVID test in the last year, you can rest assured that you\u2019re getting a high-quality, highly accurate result. That\u2019s the promise we make to our customers, which we call The Science of Sure. Our purpose, passion and promise have shown up in countless ways since the pandemic began. Some are visible externally, like extraordinarily rapid EUAs or massive increases in production capacity. But many are behind the scenes, from how we rewarded our front-line employees for their heroic efforts during the pandemic, to how our board and management team found safe ways to meet in person, to how we always tried to under-promise and over-deliver on the COVID test commitments we made to customers and governments around the world.  We talk about many of these topics in our second annual sustainability report, titled the Power of Purpose, which we just published on our website last week. I\u2019d encourage all our investors, but especially those interested in ESG issues to take a look. Now let us give you an update on our COVID testing efforts. As you can probably tell from our financial results, we continue to make good progress on our plans to expand manufacturing capacity for our two COVID assays out of our plants in San Diego and Manchester, UK. Total output increased sequentially compared to the September quarter, which enabled us to provide about 30 million COVID assays to customers, generating revenue of about $745 million. As we have said, we are now selling more COVID tests each quarter than we had ever produced of all of our molecular tests before the pandemic. And we are on track to meet our goal to produce at least 75 million total molecular diagnostic tests a quarter globally by January of 2022. This would represent more than 3.5x our total capacity pre-COVID, a tremendous accomplishment. Thanks to our employees, our suppliers, and the U.S. government, which is providing financial support.  In the first quarter, about one-third of our COVID test revenue came outside the United States, mainly from Europe. COVID testing continues to strengthen our international business, our relationships with customers, our future prospects in Diagnostics, and even market access for our other franchises. These COVID sales contributed to total international revenue of $472 million in the quarter, which represented tremendous growth of 145% on an organic basis. At the same time, we are also encouraged that demand for new Panther instruments remains very strong. You might recall that last fiscal year, we placed more than 500 new Panther systems worldwide, more than double our usual run rate. And we are off to an excellent start in fiscal 2021, with another 150 shipments in the first quarter alone. We still have a long waiting list for instruments, which we believe reflects the longevity of COVID testing that our customers anticipate.  Overall, our global installed base now stands at roughly 2,400 instruments, giving us a robust platform for future growth as more customers come to appreciate our system\u2019s best-in-class capabilities. Now let us shift gears to our third major topic, why we believe our business will be much stronger on the other side of the pandemic. First, it\u2019s never been more clear to us that demand for highly accurate molecular COVID testing will remain robust for a while. While we may have become a little numb to infection rates that remain staggeringly high in the United States and globally. But as a reminder, the almost 2 million molecular tests that are being performed daily in the United States today would annualize to a market that\u2019s about 17x bigger than the single largest molecular market before COVID. So while demand will inevitably decline as vaccines roll out, nucleic acid testing is likely to have a long, meaningful tail that extends into fiscal \u201822 and beyond, with COVID likely remaining our biggest molecular product for years to come.  As we have seen, it will take time to manufacture and administer vaccines broadly, and many people will choose not to be vaccinated. The societal need for, and focus on, COVID testing far exceeds anything we have ever seen before, and the pandemic\u2019s emotional toll will last much longer, driving future demand. As public concern around COVID persists, the combination of our huge Panther installed base, at facilities close to the patient and our gold standard assay performance have us uniquely positioned to pursue many use cases that will be around for the long-term. These include testing before hospital admissions, asymptomatic screening for various purposes, and even confirmatory testing of other, less accurate modalities.  Studies have shown that these other tests can miss two-thirds of asymptomatic cases, and these false negative results can contribute to super-spreader events. Even as the market matures and our production capacity increases, we believe our combination of robust chemistry, innovative engineering on Panther, and differentiated labeling from the FDA will help us gain market share. Moving on, the second reason Hologic will be stronger in the future is the significant non-COVID business we are gaining on our rapidly growing installed base of Panther instruments. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that in the United States, Europe and Asia, every single Panther that our commercial teams have placed has been with an eye toward the future. They are doing a fantastic job of extending and broadening commercial contracts, winning key strategic accounts, and fueling our razor, razor blade business model. As an indicator of this, last quarter we discussed Tests of Record, or TORs, which represent contracted, year-one revenue from new assay customers. We said that we achieved a new record in TORs in fiscal 2020, with non-COVID business totaling $35 million in the United States, about 50% more than we had ever done before. This positive trend has actually accelerated in early 2021, with more than $20 million of additional TORs in the first quarter alone. That\u2019s one reason that momentum in our molecular business, which was already good before COVID, is improving further today, especially in Europe. For example, when we remove COVID assay sales from our molecular number as well as instruments and ancillaries, core assay sales grew roughly 10% globally in the first quarter, more than double the rate a quarter ago. The third reason we believe we will be stronger post-COVID is that thanks to the tremendous success of our Diagnostics business, we have been able to use the last several quarters to further bolster our Breast and Surgical franchises for the future. In Breast, we have continued to expand on our strategy to diversify the business across the patient continuum of care. Rather than just placing capital equipment, we are now selling a full portfolio of hardware and software upgrades, interventional tools and service.  While the world has been understandably focused on COVID, we have increased our direct presence with Breast Health customers, and developed and launched products such as Brevera, which is off to a very good start in its re-launch. And most recently, we acquired for $64 million the German company Somatex, a long-time partner of ours, to strengthen our portfolio of breast cancer markers, enhance our commercial presence in Europe, and improve our profitability. In Surgical, both our R&D and business development pipelines have been productive, broadening the portfolio of products that we sell through a high-performing, highly engaged sales force. New products such as our Fluent, fluid management system and new hysteroscopes are complementing our market- leading MyoSure and NovaSure devices, and helped that division return to growth in the first quarter, well ahead of schedule. On the business development front, in August we spent approximately $80 million, plus future contingent earn-outs to buy Acessa Health. Acessa\u2019s ProVu is a laparoscopic RF product that is used to treat fibroids that MyoSure can\u2019t reach, so it\u2019s very complementary to our Surgical business and a nice fit for our sales force. And so far, early feedback from our customers has been good. The acquisitions of Acessa and Somatex demonstrate the final reason we will be stronger after the pandemic, the ability to use the healthy cash flow that COVID tests are generating to step up our business development activities. The pending, $230 million acquisition of Biotheranostics, which we announced earlier this month, is another good example of this strategy. Biotheranostics, a leader in molecular tests for breast and metastatic cancers, enables us to expand into the adjacent growth market of oncology. More specifically, Biotheranostics has done a great job of developing a strong clinical and reimbursement foundation for their flagship Breast Cancer Index test, which plays an important role in a large but underpenetrated breast cancer market that we know a lot about.  In addition, Biotheranostics provides us clinical lab capabilities that we can use to develop markets for novel content down the road. From a financial perspective, Biotheranostics brings more than $30 million of annual revenue, growth rates in excess of 20%, and strong gross margins. We\u2019re excited that since we announced the deal, Biotheranostics has received some very good news that will benefit women with early-stage, hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, included the Breast Cancer Index test in its guidelines to predict the benefit of extended treatment with various endocrine therapies. This should help establish the test as the standard of care for this important clinical question, and contribute to increased patient access.  Before turning the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that we are off to an excellent start in fiscal 2021. Our purpose-driven culture is driving excellent execution and performance, both in terms of our COVID tests and the recovery of our other businesses. And we are working hard to ensure that the financial success we are experiencing now will translate into a stronger company down the road. We are confident it will. Now we\u2019ll turn the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you Steve, and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I\u2019m going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, briefly touch on a few other key financial metrics, and finish with our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. As Steve said, we are very pleased with our first quarter results, as revenue and EPS significantly exceeded our guidance. Reported revenue of $1.61 billion increased 87%. Organically, revenue grew 104%, driven by strong COVID sales and the continued improvement of our base business across all major geographies. Given the incredible demand for our COVID tests and the strong results in our base business, we were able to significantly improve profit, margins and cash flow. As a result, EPS of $2.86 in the first quarter increased 369%, well ahead of our expectations. Further, operating cash flow has continued to be extremely strong, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. In Diagnostics, our largest division, global revenue of $1.128 billion grew 256% in the first quarter driven by molecular, where sales increased 449%. In response to the unprecedented demand for COVID testing, we shipped about 30 million COVID tests to customers, generating revenue of $745 million globally. And excluding COVID, our base molecular business accelerated sequentially, as customers continue to see the benefit of our assay menu and the strength of Panther\u2019s high throughput automation. Rounding out diagnostics, the cytology and perinatal businesses grew by 1% in the quarter, driven in part by a catch-up in cytology procedures at calendar year-end. In Breast Health, global revenue of $332.7 million was down slightly overall. However, performance improved compared to the fourth quarter and the business returned to slight growth in all geographies except for Latin America. The division\u2019s performance was driven by the interventional business, which grew 15% in the quarter and was helped by the re-launch of our Brevera biopsy system. Although we were encouraged by sequential improvement in the capital environment and by healthy equipment sales at calendar year-end, overall spending remains challenged because of COVID. However, our intentional diversification to service and consumables, as well as several recent acquisitions, have helped mitigate pressures on capital. As an example, Breast Health service revenue, which is larger than capital sales, grew by mid-single-digits in the quarter.  In Surgical, sales of $124 million grew 3.3%, a great result given headwinds on elective procedures from recently increasing COVID cases in some parts of the country. This result shows the strength and commitment of our Surgical sales force, as well as the benefit of several new products. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $1.14 billion increased 80% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 91%. Outside the United States, sales of $472 million increased 106% in constant currency. Organically, sales outside the U.S. grew 145%, a stellar result that reflects our growing international strength. Now let\u2019s move on to the rest of the P&L for the first quarter . Gross margin of 77.2% increased 1,560 basis points, driven by sales of high-margin COVID tests and the divestiture of the lower-margin Cynosure business. Total operating expenses of $274.5 million decreased 5.1% in the first quarter. However, expenses actually increased when normalizing for the Cynosure sale, and about $6.5 million of credits from BARDA associated with the development of our COVID assays.  These increases were driven by investments in R&D and marketing for future growth. In addition, expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan increased as a result of equity market gains. As a reminder, while this liability is marked to market, most of the expense is offset by a benefit we realized in other income in the quarter.  In addition, our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.75%, slightly lower than previously forecast driven by a favorable geographic mix of income, primarily from sales of COVID-19 assays outside the United States. Putting all this together, operating margin increased 3,270 basis points to 60.2%, and net margin increased 2,730 basis points to 46.6%. As a result, non-GAAP net income finished at $749.6 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.86, well ahead of expectations. Before we cover our 2021 second quarter guidance, I\u2019ll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Driven by demand for our COVID tests, cash flow from operations was $650 million in the first quarter, a very strong result. In fact, this was about the same as our total cash flow from operations for all of fiscal 2019.  Looked at another way, in just the last two quarters we have generated about $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, which gives us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, we repurchased nearly 1.5 million shares of stock for $101 million in the first quarter, and our Board recently approved a new $1 billion authorization, highlighting our commitment to capital deployment. And we were also able to strengthen our balance sheet by repaying our outstanding revolver balance of $250 million. As a reminder, we had borrowed against the revolver as a precautionary measure very early in the pandemic. Overall, we had $869 million of cash at the end of the first quarter. And with more than $1 billion of EBITDA for the quarter, our leverage ratio fell to 0.8 times. While we remain comfortable with a leverage ratio between two and three over the long-term, we also have no problem with a lower ratio in the short term. As you know, we are actively pursuing a number of division-led, tuck-in acquisitions and hope to use our cash to complete more deals this year, in addition to buying back our stock. Finally, ROIC was 26.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 1,440 basis points. Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. We anticipate that fiscal 2021 will be an excellent year for Hologic overall, but our business environment remains fluid due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic.  Therefore, we are only providing a single quarter of guidance today. Let me also point out that our guidance does not include the impact of the pending Biotheranostics acquisition, which has not yet closed. In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect excellent financial results again, with total revenue in the range of $1.5 to $1.56 billion. This represents an approximate doubling of organic revenue growth, to roughly 96% to 104%. Underlying this, we expect similar sales of our COVID tests to drive exceptional Diagnostics growth. As a reminder, most of our new molecular production capacity is expected to come on-line in the second half of our fiscal year. Blood screening revenue, which we back out of our organic calculations, is expected to be about $10 million in the quarter. In our other businesses, let me remind you that March quarter sales are typically down sequentially compared to the December period for our Breast, Surgical and base Diagnostics businesses, as capital sales and semi-elective procedures tend to be seasonally stronger at the end of the calendar year.  In addition, our guidance incorporates headwinds related to customer spending constraints and restrictions on procedure volumes given rising COVID cases. While our customers are much better- prepared than they were last spring to manage through local increases in COVID prevalence, we have seen a recent slowdown in some elective surgeries. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $2.56 to $2.68 in the second quarter, with extraordinary growth rates that significantly outpace revenue even as we increase investments for future growth. To put this in perspective, we expect to earn more in the second quarter alone than we did in the full year of 2019. This second quarter guidance is based on a tax rate of 21.75%, and diluted shares outstanding of 262 to 263 million for the quarter. I\u2019d also like to point out that we expect other expenses, net, to increase to close to $25 million in the second quarter, as we don\u2019t forecast gains or losses related to certain hedging activities like we saw in the first quarter. As you update your forecasts, let me remind you that macro uncertainty has increased in recent weeks due to the pandemic. While our visibility has improved compared to several months ago, we would still encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic\u2019s financial performance in the first quarter was terrific. We continue to make a huge impact fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and on women\u2019s health globally. Further, I am confident that we have positioned ourselves to deliver exceptional long-term performance.  With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Dan Leonard at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard : Thank you. So first question, you made a comment that your success for COVID testing outside of the U.S. has actually helped strengthen your other franchises. Could you elaborate a bit on that? Steve MacMillan : Yes, Dan, thank you. First off, it's funny how things go in full circle. As you know, over the last few years, we've acquired a number of our dealers in Europe on the Breast Health side and that gave us much more of a direct presence in a lot of the key countries, the UK, Germany, Spain, Portugal, just to name a few, and it\u2019s really helped us strengthen our whole team in Europe. So we've been building relationships at a higher level. As COVID has hit, it's given us incredible access to a lot of the major governments. We've got contracts with just about every major government in Europe. And in so doing, we're now on their radar screen that they really \u2013 a lot of them didn't know about the Diagnostics business and how much of a leader we are in the sexually transmitted infections and other stuff. So we've been able, as we've been selling in COVID and giving them Panthers to really be booking new business that will come online as the Panthers go down, and really just being able to talk more about our cytology business, our HPV business, and really just a different level of relationship that we think is going to strengthen us significantly down the road. Dan Leonard : Okay, that's helpful. And then a bit of an unrelated follow-up. How would you characterize the M&A environment right now? I mean, during the pandemic, in diagnostics specifically, do you think it will be -- is it feasible to do something in your core infectious disease testing phase or do you think this is an environment where you really got to wait for the pandemic to subside before those types of assets become available? Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Great question, Dan. I think, we\u2019d probably put it in a couple of different perspectives. First and foremost, I would say is as -- while we are obviously generating a ton of cash right now, we also have the luxury of being in an enormous position of strength and that our base businesses are performing. And I think the best way that you can be very disciplined on deals is when it's easy to walk away from anything because you don't need anything and you feel good about your underlying business. So then if we look at the market specifically, it's been fascinating to watch over the last eight months, right? First, everybody hunkered down back March, April, May, including ourselves. We had pushed things like the Acessa deal. We had even pushed out a few months and we'd had a relationship with Biotheranostics and kind of just wanted to see where our own cash flow was at that point in time. So now, obviously, there is a lot of companies that are fairly flushed with cash. There is also a fairly healthy IPO market right now. So there is a bit of froth out there I think and we want to be disciplined. So I would tell you, as excited as the deals we've done. I'm probably more proud of some deals we've gone pretty deep on over the last three, four months that we walked away from, really over valuation or other issues in diligence. And that's I think the maturing of our team here and that the fundamental strength. So I think we're in a position where if we can get the right assets at the right price with good ROICs, hey, that's great. And if we need to wait some things out or even miss some things, we're not going to get caught into bidding wars and overpay. So I do think it's a pretty vibrant market right now. We've had every banker beating us \u2013 beating our door down trying to sell us things as you can imagine, but staying very disciplined. Dan Leonard : I appreciate that color. Thank you. Operator : All right. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Patrick Donnelly at Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks, guys. Steve, maybe one for you. Just on the COVID testing side, I\u2019m sure you get this a lot obviously. But just on the durability side, as we think out to the back-half, obviously, the vaccine is rolling out, a little choppy here, but it's going out. As you think about the back-half and the pie possibly beginning to naturally shrink there, all test aren't created equal. So I guess where do you see Hologic kind of landing in terms of when that pie starts shrinking? Do you get a bigger piece? How does that play out? And again, certainly, your capacity is expanding. What's the view of that split between COVID and non-COVID as we get through this year? Steve MacMillan : Sure, Patrick. You're hitting on clearly one of \u2018the biggest questions. I believe very strongly that we will continue to improve our market share, right? In the beginning this was kind of the wild, wild west. The FDA granted a gazillion EUAs, everybody raced out to the market. At the end of the day, we have some very powerful and enduring assets that we believe will put us in a really good place over the long run. It starts frankly with Panther and the installed base. We know there is a ton of hospitals that in a bare minimum are going to want to continue to test everybody that comes in their doors for procedures. They have them on site, they'll be doing that.  As we seek to get more people back to work and back-to-school, there is going to be a need for high-level testing that's asymptomatic. And I think again, what's been happening in the short-term, because there wasn't enough molecular tests in the beginning and the long turnaround times, there is a big emphasis on a lot of the rapid tests, particularly some of the antigen stuff and they're going to have a place. But at the end of the day, they're not indicated, most of them for asymptomatic screening and we keep learning more and more by the day. How much of this is asymptomatically being passed along?  And when you look at a lot of these super spreader events, they are quite frankly being caused by using the wrong tests off label to try to determine whether people have something. And I think over time, what we always say to our team is the cream rises to the top. So you have Panther and it\u2019s where it's located. You have an assay that's got incredible sensitivity specificity and one of the best labels. We also have the pooling indication. And once you get back into screening, call it, next fall, right, think about simple things. We want to get everybody back to school in the fall. The vaccines still aren't indicated for people under 16. So as we keep talking about vaccinating the country, children are going to be excluded from that. We're going to want to be doing asymptomatic screening and a lot of the antigen tests that people may say are great right now, they're not going to be as effective at picking up particularly asymptomatic indications. So we have that and then you just have the pure workflow advantage that should never be forgotten and that is the workflow of Panther, the random access automation ability to just make this as easy. The lab techs around the world have been running a marathon at sprint speed, they are exhausted. You can't walk in any lab and not hear from the lab director that their techs are just tired and they would much rather be able to be using Panther. And one of the fundamental realities is, we've been shipping so much, but not all of it has been with our full pen caps and that's part of the capacity we've been building up. And as we're able to provide more and more of our pen caps, it creates the full automation benefit that not everybody has even been fully getting yet.  So, we have no idea, truly exactly how this is going to play out, but all the discussions we've been having with the Biden transition team has been continued about, \u201cHey, are you still building up more capacity?\u201c And we certainly are. We'll see how it all plays out. But I think like every market we compete in, we think we're going to be there standing. Patrick Donnelly : That's really helpful perspective, I appreciate that. And then maybe just one; you know I think Karleen mentioned it there at the end. You have seen a little bit of a recent slowdown in some elective surgeries, elective procedures, customers seeing rising COVID cases being a bit of a headwind. Can you just expand a little bit on kind of what you're seeing this quarter sequentially versus last quarter in terms of that slowdown and kind of where it's taking you guys and what the impact could be? Just want to make sure we have a good handle on that. Steve MacMillan : Yes. Overall, I would say it's really on the margin. We \u2013 frankly I think we finished the last quarter better than most. The fact that Surgical and Breast Health both ended up growing, which we wouldn't have expected. Whether they grow or stay flattish, we're probably talking little pieces here. We're seeing little pockets right in certain geographies; certainly, we\u2019ll have a couple of slower days in the surgical business or in the Breast Health consumable business. So it's I'd call it, it's a little temporary outages, but fundamentally it's going to be tiny for us given that we've got the COVID offset and I think we just continue to focus on sharing it will, take care of itself here over time, but maybe slightly more muted this quarter on a couple of those businesses, but still overall good. Patrick Donnelly : Alright, that's good to hear. Thanks Steve. Steve MacMillan : Alright. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Chris Lin of Cowen. Please go ahead. Chris Lin : Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Also, welcome back to the earnings call, Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Good job Chris remembering, alright. Chris Lin : Steve, in past quarters you provided an estimate on what percentage of Panther placements are expected to replace Tigris and also what percentage of Panther placements displace a competitor or enabled a new customer to begin testing? Do you have an update on those figures for us? Also, I know you test the record, the test of records metric to track assay adoption, but do you have an estimate on what percentage of Panthers placed over the past year are now also running non-COVID-19 tests? Michael Watts : Hey Chris, it\u2019s Mike. Let me take a crack at that. I think on your first point we \u2013 what we said a few quarters ago is in the early days we placed a significant portion of our Panthers into some of our largest customers where they were going to replace Tigris\u2019s over time and provide access to a broader menu, there\u2019s four test approved on Tigris I think, now 18 on Panther if you include the two COVID test. We haven\u2019t given an update on that since then, so I don\u2019t have an update for a specific number for you today. I would tell you that by and large, we are focusing on our existing customers obviously and broadening our relationships with those customers. If you think about where our Panthers sit overall, you know most of them still in hospital labs and I think this gets back to one of the comments as Steve was making earlier about how getting testing closer to the patient is going to help us from a share perspective going forward for pre-op procedures, things like that. And then the second part of your question Chris, on TOR\u2019s was what percentage of the new Panthers, isn\u2019t it? Yes, I don\u2019t know that number either, but I think as Steve said in his prepared remarks, that\u2019s what the sales force is focused on, right. And we\u2019ve talked a bit in the past about how we\u2019re extra incentivizing our sales force to bring in new non-COVID business and they\u2019ve done a great job of that.  So I think as Steve said in the prepared remarks, I mean basically every Panther that we placed is being placed with an eye toward the future and that run rate of TORs. I mean we did $35 million last year, we talked about this. That was 50% more than we had ever done before, pretty excited about that, and now in the first quarter we do another $20 million. So don\u2019t know if that will continue with that pace, but certainly at a good run rate here out of the SHU. Chris Lin : Okay, great. Then for my follow-up, I just wanted to go back to the topic of decentralization. One of your largest peers and hired throughput COVID-19 Diagnostics recently announced the acquisition of a molecular point-of-care platform. Beyond that acquisition I think this pandemic has also just highlighted the need for rapid but accurate diagnostic tools. Now given that Panther is in a unique position as a leading mid-to-high throughput molecular diagnostics platform, do you want to extend that leadership to a lower volume setting. Really, do you have any updated thoughts on that market opportunity? Steve MacMillan : Yes. We continue to look at different areas and different technologies Chris. I mean I\u2019ll tell you, if we\u2019ve been inundated we\u2019d probably get five or 10 per day, little companies, different technologies coming our way. We\u2019re certainly looking at some. We\u2019re probably generally a little more focused in the labs that we\u2019re \u2013 you know in our existing customers. We\u2019re always looking on the fringe other ways to extend out from there. So we\u2019ll continue to look at everything and stay disciplined on where we can get a good return and where we can bring value to the market. Chris Lin : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Alright, we\u2019ll take our next question from Tycho Peterson at J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks Steve. I\u2019m going to stick with the durability seen. I\u2019m just curious, you know in the last few weeks, obviously new strengths have emerged and then you\u2019ve got the new administration making a big push here, so a couple of quick hits if you will.  Where are you on a test for the new variants? And then as we think about mix, I think up till now you basically have been doing lots of stand-alone COVID. How do you think about combo assays, mix shifting over the course of the year, and then how do you think about the sustainability of the current pricing trends and reimbursement as it stands today? Steve MacMillan : Yes Tycho, thanks. I think in terms of the new variance, right now we feel very good that the way we\u2019ve designed our test, you know we have basically designed ours with two targets to ensure there\u2019s a backup target in case the virus mutates. So we continue to watch that but feel very good, and this is part of many advantages of having an incredibly sensitive and specific test to begin with, it targets the genomic regions that are less likely to mutate. So I think we feel very good about our ability to continue to catch those very well. And the second part of that was what again the multiplex. Tycho Peterson : [Cross Talk] Steve MacMillan : I\u2019m sorry. Yes, the multiplex, we figure come the fall \u2013 for this winter as we all know there\u2019s basically been no flu season demand for our product. It\u2019s virtually been entirely our single COVID test. I think come next fall, having a syndromic multi, multiple option is probably going to make more sense and you would expect that we\u2019ll typically be there. Tycho Peterson : And pricing and reimbursement? Steve MacMillan : I think at least in the short term, we\u2019re probably still reasonable. I think over the long run we\u2019ve got to assume both of those will eventually come down. But I think at this point, particularly with the Biden administration extending the public health emergency through the end of 2021, we don\u2019t see any real near-term pressure on reimbursement. I\u2019m sure again, that will probably start to evolve as we go forward and it may evolve at different paces with different governments around the world as well, but so that ultimately will be some downward pressure certainly probably on pricing, but feel pretty good about where we are right now. Tycho Peterson : And then one on capital deployment for [inaudible] you\u2019re putting up great numbers, your stock still trading around 10x EBITDA, so how are you thinking about buybacks? Would you consider an ASR? Steve MacMillan : Yes. We certainly did an ASR in conjunction with the Cynosure divestiture. In general, not a huge fan of those short of an event. I think we\u2019ve been pretty good buyers of our stock. When you look back over the last, really five fiscal years, I think we\u2019ve bought back over 30 million shares and been fairly consistent last year even more so.  I think it continues to be an important part of our strategy, but probably more executed along the way, both offsetting dilution, as well as frankly we\u2019ve been reducing our share count really now for a number of years. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thank you. Operator : Alright, we\u2019ll now take our next question from Raj Denhoy at Jefferies. Please go ahead. Zachary Weiner : Hey, this is Zach on for Raj. Just a few from us. You started the year by announcing two acquisitions and a $1 billion buyback. Can you give any more detail on the potential timing of that share repurchase program? Should we expect it to start to come in post COVID? And then also, can you give any more color on potential deals size and/or timing of future deals? Karleen Oberton : Hi, this is Karleen, so let me just make a couple of comments in regards to capital allocation. Certainly we\u2019re focused on deploying our free cash flow, which has grown tremendously over the last several quarters. Our priority is going to be that tuck-in M&A growth accretive assets and I think to build on the comments that Steve made, capital - share repurchase is going to be part of that strategy, but I would say the $1 billion authorization is over a five year period. So we would expect to utilize that on some regular cadence over that period of time. Steve MacMillan : Great! Next. Operator : We\u2019ll now take our next question from Jack Meehan at Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Steve MacMillan : Hey, Jack. Jack Meehan : Wanting to talk about the core business. So as you reflected on the quarter, how much do you think pent-up demand contributed across the three segments? I know you talked about some catch-up in cytology, but do you think there might have been some flush from hospitals in Breast Health and timed surgical procedures going back? Steve MacMillan : We think there was probably some catch-up. Again is it a few percentage points, is it saying \u2013 it\u2019s hard to completely quantify Jack in terms of both cytology, as well as surgical and plus you have the year-end, people trying to get them in who have exceeded their Caps for the year, so you tend to have a pretty good time at year-end.  In terms of capital a little hard to know; we saw a little bit of strength in pockets, certainly. I think the way we\u2019re thinking about it overall is there\u2019s still going to be some little puts and takes here as the markets settle back down in the coming quarters. Are we continuing to take market share? Are we continuing to get stronger? And none of it frankly is going to make a huge difference. Do we grow a 100% next quarter or 95%, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re talking on the base business, what would be minor percentages in terms of the total. Karleen Oberton : Yes, the only thing I would add on that is that on the Brevera relaunch there was definitely some pent-up demand for capital for that relaunch and I think that really bodes well for that product moving forward and we think that will be a nice contributor to the Breast Health division. Zachary Weiner : Great! And then I was hoping to maybe give a little bit of color around expectations for new product launches throughout 2021. What do you have in the pipeline? Should we think kind of more incremental launches and how does the environment make you think about maybe doing larger moves in any other businesses for coming out of the R&D portfolio? Steve MacMillan : Yes, I think in terms of your \u2013 the first question, I think we\u2019ve got you know consistently a lot of singles coming in new product development. Frankly we hit a Grand Slam in Diagnostics and put all of our energy and it\u2019s hard for people to fully understand how much R&D and manufacturing and quality assurance resources went into getting all of both the assays out for COVID, as well as the additional label indications, things like pooling and they involve a lot of software. So we\u2019re continuing even just on pathways to continue to strengthen there. In Breast Health we\u2019ve got a number of things coming out using AI. We\u2019ve got follow-ups from the SSI acquisition on ultrasound. You know Brevera is really in the process of rolling out. So we\u2019ve got a lot of additional software and smaller things there. Then we\u2019ve got obviously Acessa, the Pro-View product rolling in within the surgical business. So I think we feel very good about the cadence of those things rolling out. And then on the M&A front, I\u2019ll probably go back to our \u2013 the comment I made in probably answering the first question or so, which is to me the best way to be disciplined in M&A is to have a great core business and all of our business\u2019s right now are good. We\u2019ve also got just really good teams able to do some great due diligence. We\u2019ve really walked away from a number of things actually even over the last few months and we continue to work others. So I think we\u2019re able to look a little bit bigger, certainly given the cash, but we don\u2019t necessarily have big eyes or big needs and I think if anything, we\u2019re probably likely to be building a little bit more of a cash position here in the near term as Karleen mentioned. We\u2019ve generated a $1 billion [ph] of cash, just in the last two quarters. We certainly aren\u2019t spending at that rate and that\u2019s okay for right now, we\u2019ll be patient and disciplined. Michael Watts : Hey Edwardo, I think we have\u2026 Zachary Weiner : Thank you guys. Michael Watts : Edwardo, I think we have time for may be one more question. Operator : Alright, we\u2019ll now take our last question from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Daniel Markowitz : Hi, this is Daniel on for Vijay. Thanks for taking the question. Your comment on the 150 Panther placements in the quarter with a strong order book, I\u2019m just wondering on capacity for Panther production or in other words, how I should think about the unwind on that order book? Steve MacMillan : Sure, we\u2019re continuing to produce Panthers at a similar rate right now to what we just placed, given that we still have very strong demand. I think probably later into calendar year \u201821, does that start to back down a little bit, probably given the extreme ramp-up, but we are continuing to produce at a similar rate right now. Daniel Markowitz : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's first quarter of fiscal 2021 earnings conference call. Have a good evening!",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to Hologic\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jenny, and I\u2019m your operator for today\u2019s call. Today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Michael Watts : Thank you, Jenny. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Hologic\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the Company\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we will have a question-and-answer session. Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through May 21st. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those that are referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue. We define organic revenue as constant currency revenue excluding the divested Blood Screening business as well as the acquired Acessa, Biotheranostics and Diagenode businesses. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I would like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic\u2019s CEO. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. We posted excellent financial results overall, highlighted by best-in-class growth rates. Total revenue was $1.54 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.59, both in line with our guidance. Organic revenue doubled, driven by strong recovery and momentum in our base businesses as well as our continued contributions to the COVID-19 fight. On the bottom line, EPS more than quadrupled. Our diversified business model again demonstrated its value in the second quarter as strong growth rates in our core businesses enabled us to meet our overall guidance even though COVID assay sales were less than expected. Our base Diagnostics business and our Surgical franchise, both finished slightly better than forecast, even while overcoming a tough January for U.S. Healthcare utilization that was driven by increasing COVID cases. And our Breast Health division clearly outperformed as our diversification strategy has led to a faster-than-expected recovery. Karleen will cover the revenue and expense details. But before she does, I would like to discuss two primary topics. When the COVID pandemic began more than a year ago, we set out to accomplish two things in simple terms : first, we committed to make as big an impact as possible against the pandemic. And second, we wanted to ensure that every action we took helped us emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company. We are clearly accomplishing both goals, which makes us more excited than ever about our future. In terms of our first goal, helping fight the pandemic on a global scale. Let\u2019s summarize our contributions by focusing on four key numbers. Our first number is 100 million. Soon, we will ship our 100 millionth COVID test to customers, which included 27 million in the second quarter. At the same time, we have maintained our commitment to provide Women\u2019s Health test by dramatically increasing total molecular diagnostics production capacity. We are on-track with our expansion plans in San Diego and Manchester, U.K. to have the capacity to make at least 75 million tests a quarter across our portfolio by January of 2022. Our second number is 40. This is the number of countries in which we have sold COVID tests as we help battle what has been and continues to be a global crisis. COVID testing continues to strengthen our international business, our relationships with customers, our future prospects in diagnostics and even market access for our other franchises. These COVID sales contributed to total international revenue of $474 million in the second quarter, which represented tremendous growth of 142%. Our third number is 717. This is the number of Panther instruments we have shipped to global customers over the last year, including about 190 in the second quarter. As a reminder, in the five-years before COVID, we shipped an average of 225 Panthers a year. So we have more than tripled that pace over the last 12-months. In addition, we are encouraged that demand for Panthers remains very high and for all of fiscal 2021, we expect to exceed last year\u2019s record placements. Overall, our global installed base now stands at roughly 2,600 instruments, approximately 40% higher than when the pandemic began, giving us a robust platform for future growth as more customers come to appreciate our system\u2019s best-in-class capabilities. And as we have discussed, we are seeing this play out with record levels of new non-COVID business on these Panthers. All these numbers lead to our fourth number, which is $2.35 billion. This is the total COVID assay revenue we have generated on a global basis since the pandemic began, including $680 million in the second quarter. And this has contributed very significantly to operating cash flow of nearly $1.9 billion over the last year. This has enabled us to acquire four companies and sign a deal for a fifth, even while further strengthening our balance sheet. We will discuss our business development activity more in a minute. Before we do that, we wanted to provide our current perspective on the changes in the COVID testing market that you have all seen, with the understanding that the pandemic and its impact on Hologic remain highly unpredictable. Based on publicly available data for the U.S., molecular COVID testing volumes remain very high, much higher than for any other molecular test. But have declined significantly since January based on a better-than-expected vaccine rollout. In this context, our U.S. sales of COVID tests also declined significantly in March and further in April. We believe that molecular COVID testing demand will likely decline further as vaccines roll out, but remain important into fiscal 2022 and beyond. This reflects the ongoing need for accurate clinical diagnosis, the value of testing for infection control purposes and the so-called back to life testing that is helping to reopen economies. Panther installed base at facilities close to the patient and our gold-standard assay performance have us uniquely positioned to gain market share. Customers continue to tell us that Panther and Aptima remain their products of choice and that they intend to consolidate on our platforms. But we believe many of them are using up less automated assays before they expire. Customers had accumulated these tests in the winter when they needed multiple manufacturers to accommodate than higher levels of demand. This dynamic is further supported by the public AdvaMed data that many of you see, which show that industry-wide tests performed are now running ahead of tests shipped, indicating that inventory is being worked down. In response to these market changes, we pivoted in two ways in the second quarter. First, by selling more COVID tests to our base hospital customers who want to bring highly accurate testing closer to their patients, improving turnaround times and clinical relevance. Panther is well positioned for this with first test results being delivered in about three hours. Notably, COVID tests are now being run on Panthers in more than 600 clinical labs in the United States. This means that COVID is the second most decentralized test that we sell, following only Aptima Combo 2, which has been on the U.S. market for roughly 20-years. Second, we pivoted by selling more tests internationally. As everyone has seen in the news, the vaccine rollout is proceeding at different paces around the world. Europe, in particular, has struggled with inoculations, increasing the importance of testing. For example, in the second quarter, almost 40% of our COVID assay revenue came from outside the United States, mainly from Europe. Now let\u2019s shift gears to our second major topic, an update on how the tremendous impact we have made against COVID has strengthened our business for the other side of the pandemic. As many of you will recall, before the pandemic hit, our organic growth rate had been steadily improving to around 5% based on new products, international expansion and our early acquisitions. Now as we begin our annual strategic planning process, we are confident that organic growth for the next several years, excluding COVID assay sales, will be higher than it was before the pandemic hit. In Diagnostics, we have used COVID cash flows to broaden our portfolio by buying assets that are growing faster than our base business. Since the Gen-Probe acquisition in 2012, we had acquired exactly zero companies in Diagnostics. But since late February, we have completed two deals and announced a third, dramatically accelerating our long-standing goal to become a more complete diversified diagnostics leader. In February, we closed our $232 million acquisition of Biotheranostics, a leader in molecular tests for breast and metastatic cancers, enabling us to expand into the adjacent growth market of oncology. This business is off to a very strong start, based mainly on the inclusion of the Breast Cancer Index test in NCCN guidelines to predict the benefit of extended treatment with endocrine therapies. A few days after we closed Biotheranostics, we acquired Diagenode, a Belgian developer and manufacturer of molecular diagnostic assays and epigenetics products for approximately $153 million. Diagenode, which generated more than $30 million of revenue in the last year, will enable us to offer a broader, more differentiated menu of molecular diagnostic tests on our fully automated high-throughput Panther Fusion instrument. We know Diagenode\u2019s capabilities in assay development well, since we have partnered with them since 2016 to develop and manufacture PCR bases assays for Fusion. As you might recall, the ability to leverage external PCR expertise was one of the reasons we developed the Fusion system years ago. Now that Diagenode is part of Hologic, we can accelerate those assay development efforts and make many of their CE Mark PCR tests available on our unique platform, further enhancing European growth. Finally, earlier this month, we announced our agreement to acquire Mobidiag, a Finnish developer of innovative molecular diagnostics tests and instrumentation for approximately $795 million. In contrast to Diagenode, which helps us leverage our Fusion installed base around the world, Mobidiag brings new capabilities that we have been interested in for more than a decade. Specifically, Mobidiag is an innovator in near-patient acute care diagnostics, a large, rapidly growing area that we don\u2019t compete in today. This market encompasses test for respiratory and gastrointestinal conditions, health care-associated infections and antibiotic resistance among others. Having monitored this space closely over the years, we believe Mobidiag\u2019s Novodiag platform is a truly differentiated assay with a unique combination of ease of use, rapid turnaround, multiplexing and low cost. Mobidiag generated more than $40 million of revenue in calendar 2020 with a limited commercial presence and no sales in the United States. So we believe we can accelerate their growth globally, but especially in the United States once we get some of their assays approved here. Before I turn the call over to Karleen, I wanted to touch briefly on how we have also strengthened our Breast and Surgical businesses during the pandemic. In Breast, we have continued to expand on our strategy to diversify the business across the patient continuum of care. We now sell a full portfolio of capital equipment, hardware and software upgrades, interventional tools and service. While the world has been understandably focused on COVID, we have increased our direct presence with Breast Health customers. We have launched new software products based on our investments in artificial intelligence. And we have strengthened our interventional franchise by re-launching Brevera, which is doing very well, and buying SOMATEX, a longtime partner and leading developer of breast cancer markers. Together, all these strategies helped Breast Health outperform in the second quarter with total sales exceeding 2019 levels and global growth of 7.3%. While the mammography market is not quite back to pre-COVID levels, we are very pleased with our competitive position and growth outlook for the future. In Surgical, both our R&D and business development pipelines have been productive. Broadening the portfolio of products that we sell through a high-performing, highly-engaged sales force. New products such as our Fluent Fluid Management System, new hysteroscopes and Acessa\u2019s laparoscopic RF product, ProVu are complementing our market-leading MyoSure and NovaSure devices. As a result, Surgical sales surpassed 2019 levels in the second quarter and grew 6.6% on a global basis, even while overcoming a slow January that resulted from reduced procedures in U.S. regions that were hit hard by COVID. So in conclusion, I want to emphatically state that I have never been more excited or confident in our future. We have responded to the world\u2019s need for COVID testing in a remarkable fashion and will continue to be there for testing needs around the world. Even more importantly, we have literally strengthened every one of our businesses in every geography and added multiple new growth platforms to our company during the last 12-months. I\u2019m truly amazed at what our team has done, and we really look forward to the quarters and years ahead. Now I will turn the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I\u2019m going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. As Steve said, our second quarter results were excellent as revenue and EPS grew significantly compared to the prior year. Reported revenue of 1.54 billion increased 99%. Organically, revenue grew an even 100%, driven by strong growth in our base businesses and a healthy contribution from global COVID testing revenue. We met our top and bottom line guidance even as the COVID testing market changed rapidly late in the quarter. Based on our strong top line, we significantly improved profitability compared to the prior year. As a result, EPS of $2.59 more than quadrupled in the second quarter, increasing 354%. Further, operating cash flow has continued to be exceptionally strong, which I will discuss in a moment. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. In Diagnostics, our largest division, global revenue of 1.065 billion grew 225% in the second quarter. This was driven by molecular where sales increased 378%. Although COVID testing declined sequentially from peak levels in the first quarter, demand is still very high. We shipped about 27 million COVID tests to customers, generating revenue of 680 million globally. Excluding COVID, our base molecular business continue to grow as customers capitalize on the breadth of our assay menu and the strength of Panther\u2019s best-in-class automation. Rounding out Diagnostics, the Cytology & Perinatal businesses grew 1% in the quarter, in line with trends before the pandemic. In Breast Health, global revenue of $336.3 million grew 7%, which we are very pleased with. Revenue also increased sequentially compared to Q1 and exceeded the second quarter of 2019 on a reported basis. The division\u2019s strong performance was well rounded as breast imaging grew 6%, driven by upgrade packages, and the interventional business increased 14%, driven by Brevera. Furthermore, Breast Health achieved growth in disposables, service and even capital versus the prior year period. Although the capital environment probably isn\u2019t fully back to normal, we have been encouraged by the continued improvement in this area as customers have learned to effectively manage through the pandemic and become more comfortable making future investments. In Surgical, second quarter revenue also exceeded 2019 levels, continuing the division\u2019s rapid recovery. Compared to the prior year, sales of 114.2 million grew 7% as elective procedure volumes strengthened throughout the quarter following a challenging January. The improving macro environment, coupled with multiple new products and a motivated sales force gives us confidence in the future trajectory of the Surgical franchise. Lastly, in Skeletal, revenue of 22.6 million declined 7% compared to the prior year. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of 1.06 billion increased 85% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 87%. Outside the United States, sales of 474 million increased 142%. Organically, sales outside the U.S. grew 141%, a fantastic result that reflects our growing international strength. Now let\u2019s move on to the rest of the P&L for the second quarter. Gross margins of 75% increased 1,400 basis points driven by the sales of our high-margin COVID tests. Total operating expenses of 277.7 million increased 25% in the second quarter. This included about 1.3 million of credits from BARDA associated with the development of our COVID assays. This is about five million less than in Q1. The increase in our operating expenses was driven by investments in R&D and marketing for future growth as well as incremental expense from the acquisitions that Steve discussed. Also remember, that in the second quarter of 2020, we had begun to pull back on spending, given the initial uncertainty of the pandemic. Our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter is 21.2%, slightly lower than forecast, driven by a favorable geographic mix of income, primarily from sales of COVID-19 assays outside the United States. Putting these all together, operating margin increased 2,540 basis points to 56.9%, and net margin increased 2,380 basis points to 43.8%. As a result, non-GAAP income finished at 674.1 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.59, in line with our guidance in more than four times the prior year period. Before we cover our guidance, I will quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Driven by demand for our COVID tests and the strong performance of our base business, cash flow from operations was 552 million in the second quarter. These strong cash flows have given us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, in the second quarter alone, our operating cash flow essentially paid for 568 million of productive capital redeployment. Specifically, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of stock for $120 million, closed the SOMATEX deals for 63 million, acquired Biotheranostics for 232 million and bought Diagenode for 153 million. As Steve said, we believe these acquisitions will make Hologic a stronger company as the pandemic subsides and sets us up for faster growth. Overall, we had 816 million of cash at the end of the second quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.7 times. We intend to continue to put our cash to work on a combination of division-led, tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases that improve our top and bottom line growth rates. Finally, ROIC was 33.4% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 2,090 basis points. Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. While we anticipate that fiscal 2021 will be an excellent year for Hologic overall, COVID testing revenue remains highly unpredictable, so we are continuing our recent practice of providing a single quarter of guidance today. In our third quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect strong financial results again with total revenue in the range of one billion to 1.07 billion, representing constant currency growth of 18% to 26% versus the prior year period. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2019, we generated about 850 million of revenue, which also included the divested Cynosure business, so we expect to grow above those pre-pandemic levels. In our base businesses, we expect continued momentum and recovery to generate very strong revenue growth rates compared to the prior year given the negative impact of the pandemic a year ago. In terms of COVID assay sales, the market remains unpredictable as discussed. While trends seem to be stabilizing today, the environment certainly could change again in May or June, depending on a number of factors, so we are going to be very cautious with our third quarter guidance and get back to our usual practice of providing conservative estimates that we have high visibility on. If demand exceeds our current expectations, we are poised to deliver for our customers. There is a lot we don\u2019t know, but what we do know is that our assays and systems are best-in-class, and that we have Panthers in all the right hospitals and labs. So we are confident that we will get more than our fair share of the ongoing demand. With this background, we expect sales of our COVID test to range from 200 million to 250 million in the third quarter. In addition, COVID-related items in Diagnostics such as collection kits, instruments and ancillaries are expected to be down 40 million to 45 million sequentially. Our third quarter guidance includes about more than $20 million of revenue from SOMATEX, Biotheranostics and Diagenode. Backing this out, as well as nine million of expected Blood Screening revenue, we expect organic revenue growth of 15% to 24% in the quarter. This is excellent growth against a difficult comp as we generated 324 million of COVID assay sales in the prior year period. Beyond revenue, here are a few other points on guidance. Our guidance does not include the impact of the pending Mobidiag acquisition, which is expected to close early in our fourth fiscal quarter. It does, however, include a full quarter of expenses from Biotheranostics and Diagenode, which will contribute to a sequential increase in total operating expenses. Below operating income, I would point out that we expect other expenses net to increase to about 25 million in the third quarter. Our guidance is based on a tax 21.5% and diluted shares outstanding of 261 million for the quarter. All these nets out to expected EPS of $1 to $1.15 in the third quarter. This would translate into very strong growth rates of 33% to 53% that significantly outpaced revenue, even as we increase investments for future growth. As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic showed tremendous growth in the second quarter and posted results that met our guidance. We continue to make a huge impact on the pandemic and on Women\u2019s Health globally. Further, with organic investments in multiple acquisitions, I\u2019m confident that we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger, larger, faster-growing company. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Thank you, good afternoon. Steve, Karleen, I appreciate all the color on the many dynamics at play when it comes to COVID testing. I was wondering, as you look at the guidance for the upcoming quarter, how much of the sequential step down would you say is related to kind of burn down of inventory that is in the channel? And if you will humor me, how are you thinking about longer-term demand for COVID testing given all the additional capacity that you are building? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, Jeff, it is a great question. If we dimensionalize, we clearly see the inventory bleeding down, both in the tail - really throughout last quarter, and we are assuming continuing to bleed down this quarter. The hard part for us, we kind of internally use the toilet paper analogy and I think people can understand this really easy. When households first went into COVID, they are ordering toilet paper from everywhere, right and multiple brands and from multiple vendors. And what clearly happened here, I don\u2019t think it is been as fully grasped in the outside world has been all of the vendors stockpiled as much supply as they could get from multiple vendors because we of course had people on allocation. So when you can\u2019t get enough when do you order and now they are bleeding through that. I think we look forward to the day where that is probably bled down and we are back to tests matching - test chip matching test performed. I think as that comes, that would clearly probably be a little bit of upside. We are being a little cautious in how we are continuing to think about that bleed down. Looking forward to the second part of your question, you have been all over it. Look at everything. I think we still see this as a meaningful business for us in the future. And to put in perspective, the $200 million to $250 million that we have guided to for this quarter, while it looks like a big step down from where we have been, I would remind everybody on this call that is larger than our entire Molecular Diagnostics business ever was pre-COVID. So we are still looking at a big business, and that is why we are continuing to expand our production. And personally, I think we are going to see a pretty strong - we are assuming right now within the U.S., call it, June, July, August could be pretty fallow. I think as things come down, people get up. But dollars to dots, next fall, you know what? People didn\u2019t get the flu this year. They didn\u2019t get sick as people start to get out again, there is going to be a lot of people getting sniffles, getting all kinds of stuff. And whether it is COVID or not, the fear of COVID is going to create an enduring demand. And by that point, all the peripheral vendors candidly will be gone. And it is going to be the big folks with the installed bases and the most automated basis that will prevail. And so I think we feel really good as we listen to all of our customers, they want the automated platforms. They are using up their non-automated stuff just because they bought it, and they can\u2019t wait to really start just running Panthers in our tests. So I don\u2019t want to give you an exact number at this point because I think anybody that does is wildly speculating. But I do think this is going to be a big sizable business for us, certainly well into our next fiscal year. But we are planning a little more cautiously near-term. Jack Meehan : That makes sense. And pricing looks firm in the quarter at around $25. Do you expect to hold at these levels, given your positioning with the automated system in the market or do you think it makes sense to get a little bit more aggressive here? Stephen MacMillan : I think we will be more aggressive here as we go forth, particularly as some of our possible vendors buy for, for example, the school contracts that, you know, just got sort of delayed. At this point, as supply has ramped up in our ability, we can offer some of the cost savings through to our customers. And frankly, it will still be very good for us and very good for them. But I would think as we look over the next year, you should expect that to definitely move down. Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Yes. I would just say as well, Jack, as international becomes a bigger piece, again we will see the overall average ASP come down for sure. Operator : And so we will move to our next question from Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo. Daniel Leonard : Thank you. So two questions. First off, it looks like your Diagnostics business, excluding COVID, might have grown about 11% organically, first off, is that correct? And then secondly, why wouldn\u2019t that be a bit better given the easy comp, the tours, the higher Panther installed base, the things we have been talking about? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. Dan, I think a couple of pieces there. First off, we didn\u2019t exactly have an easy comp. Last year, if you recall, in Europe, our Molecular Diagnostics business grew, I think, well over 30% in the quarter. We had actually a monster quarter last year when we reported at this time, so we had a big number. The other piece, candidly, is we are watching the toggle and the shift. So still a huge part of the volume is being used for COVID. I think as we start to shift out here that will start to grow. Now it is also dependent on women going back for their health visits. And the one thing we have certainly seen, and I think this bodes well for the future quarters for us is while women\u2019s visits are still way down, there are still a lot of basically pent-up demand that should come back here over time, but it doesn\u2019t snap back immediately to 100%. A lot of the intercity clinics have been diverted to doing COVID testing as they start to get back up to speed. So in a weird way, I think it gives us more runway going forward, but probably slightly less than exciting in the near-term on necessarily that base. We also have the ancillaries and some of the other stuff that are in those numbers. Daniel Leonard : Okay. And then my second question, so the COVID views amongst the peer sets are really diverging this quarter. Some are using the flu analogy for what might be durable. What do you think about that analogy and how defensible then is your position in COVID, given that you hadn\u2019t historically had a whole lot of market share in molecular flu and how important is Mobidiag to this calculus? Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Sure. Certainly, over the longer run Mobidiag is going to play beautifully into that. For the coming season, as it relates particularly to the United States, Mobidiag will not be a factor for us. But I still think there is going to be a strong need - there will certainly be the multiplex opportunities out there. But we think there is going to also be a very strong need as we had continued to say through this year to confirm whether something is truly coven or not as all the broad test. So we believe, with our customer base, hospitals, especially key labs, everything else, that there is going to be a meaningful need to confirm whether people have COVID and using a true good molecular platform. Whereas, frankly, traditional flu, you haven\u2019t needed the levels of sensitivity and specificity. When it comes to COVID, people are still going to want that. Operator : And moving on, we will hear from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. I actually want to follow up on the Mobidiag question and a couple as well on Diagenode. I\u2019m just wondering, Steve, if you could talk a little bit more about the strategy here with Diagenode? You talked about the CE Mark assays infusion, so how do we think about bringing those to the U.S. and time lines to build out the menu? And then similarly, with Mobidiag, you are giving two instruments, the Amplidiag, which similar to Panther, so how do you think about kind of future menu development on those platforms? Obviously, those are multiplexing, but those platforms versus content on Panther? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think, clearly, the way we think about Diagenode is all about content on Panther. And particularly, a lot of the - if you look at the European landscape, particularly too, there is a much been a little bit of a competitive disadvantage is why we started to work with Diagenode in the first place. So it is really filling out that menu with largely still a focus on our European business. And I think a totally underappreciated aspect of what has happened to this company in the last 12-months, I would argue, is the strength of our European and frankly, broader international business. We are a completely different player in Europe today when looked at by leading customers, leading governments, everything than where we were 12-months ago. We were barely known, and now we are front and center on so many discussions. So Diagenode is going to play there beautifully. And then for Mobidiag, we really see it, over time, especially getting into the acute care settings as a big, big opportunity. First, obviously, in Europe, where they have already got a little bit of a presence, but ultimately getting everything ported over and cleared here in the United States. That is probably going to be more of a 2024, 2025 massive growth drivers then. We are being a little conservative in terms of when we get all of that proof tier. But it is going to give us another chance to place a box that is a different kind of box with different capabilities closer to the patient setting. So I think a really great technology. We know that was a highly competitive are really pleased we have prevailed in that. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then for the follow-up, back to kind of the COVID dynamics. As we think about the Panthers you placed over the past year, what percentage of those went into the reference labs because I think Quest has said they are expecting 50% sequential decline in COVID volumes this quarter. And then on the hospital side, how long do you think that inventory work down last? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, we are not going to get into the exact split between the reference labs and the hospital labs. I would say they were all meaningful when you look at 717 that we have placed. I think the magic, for us, even with the reference labs as their volumes come down recall, on TIGRIS, we only have four assays approved. On Panther, we have in the teens. So it is immediately opening up the dialogue with those customers to expand our menu, particularly as we come out with the BV/CV other things. So I think that is going to be part of the magic for us as well as being there certainly, if they do end up getting some help on if they get some of the school contracts or other things, but even as we go into next year. So I think we just feel better poised across the board with our Panther placements, which just gives us much more optionality. Operator : We will move to our next question from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Good thanks. Steve, maybe just a follow-up on that last comment. It is great to obviously see the Panther placements, I think, 190 in the quarter. The installed base is obviously much more significant now. Just kind of wondering, I guess, when you think out about the clearly built out a lot of capacity given kind of this unprecedented demand for COVID. Just wondering, in your view, kind of the key pieces that fill that gap as COVID pulls back clearly comping now, but even if that remains some level of volumes, what are the key pieces to kind of fill that and where do you see utilization going on this larger fleet even a couple of years out? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think it is hard to probably fully describe our excitement, Patrick, as to where this goes. And let\u2019s take it in simple terms. First off, lab folks have been going on adrenaline for the last year trying to get - there is been so much automated stuff they were dealing with. They all want to consolidate on an automated platform. We are even hearing out of Europe is from a number of customers just recently They just can\u2019t wait to get our Panthers fully up and running because they know they can run them after hours. They don\u2019t need to be handheld. They don\u2019t need people there. And so I think, as you really look at it, everybody is going to go to the best-performing most automated machines with the best menu. And I hate to say it, but we say it all the time, the cream rises to the top. It is hard to beat our Panther system and with our menu. And the number of governors that called us last year early on asking why they wanted more samples was because \"They kept touring the labs in their states and the people kept saying, look, we need Panthers. We want Panthers that is the one we want.\" So I think as this all shakes out here in the coming months, that we will do what we have always done really well and continue to grow our menu and Panther and that volume, which, as you had seen, average revenues per Panther, we have had a tremendous track record over seven, eight, nine years now. That number is just going to continue to go north. Patrick Donnelly : That is helpful. And then maybe just focusing on COVID again can you just talk about the trends in the quarter? And clearly, as you noticed, we can all see the data that showed significant softening in March and April. Any metrics you can give around kind of Hologic-specific volume decline? And then going forward, just how you are specifically thinking about your share as the pie continues to shrink here in the U.S. and the OUS I know you guys have some pretty large contracts historically tied to COVID. How much can those help provide a level of stable volumes and should we expect any more of those or is that dialogue quieted down a bit? Stephen MacMillan : That was a great like five-part follow-up, Patrick. We are going to give you the new award. I will try to get it all. And if I don\u2019t get it, hopefully, Karleen and Mike are paying close attention. In terms of the quarter, January continued to be remarkably strong. So at the time we were sitting here giving our guidance, think about it, only 90-days ago, vaccines were just barely beginning. We were just transitioning from one president to another, vaccines were in the very early days and the post-holiday testing was spiking. So then we clearly saw it kind of turned a little bit in Feb. I think March and April have really been a lot of inventory catch up. And I would argue that that will shake itself out here probably pretty quickly, and then we will be a good place. The longer-term contracts on the last part, it is why we feel really good about a lot of the approaches we have taken with our governments particularly around the world, where we have often signed folks up for six, nine, 12-months contract where we guaranteed them supply and you know as of right now we have not - you want to knock on wood, but every customer that we have sold into has continued to come back and wants to continue to work with us. And I think that is where we feel really good, we know a number of the countries that even early on, we said we couldn\u2019t provide them what they wanted and they went elsewhere they also came back to us. So I think we see this being more persistent and it is where, certainly, our international footprint, particularly Europe and then the Australias and New Zealands of the world. Obviously, we are not a big player in India, so don\u2019t expect anything there. But for the major Western markets, we are in a really good place. Operator : And we will move to our next question from Chris Lin of Cowen. Chris Lin : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions. So first, I wanted to follow-up on the COVID-19 dynamic. So Steve, Hologic has meaningfully accelerated organic and inorganic investments due to the cash flow associated with COVID-19. So with this in mind, could you just comment on how lower-than-expected 2019 volume and potential cash flow impact how you think about making these investments going forward? Do you need to pull back or are you still going to invest significantly with the longer-term horizon in mind? Stephen MacMillan : We don\u2019t need to pull back on anything because none of the forward-looking thinking is any different than what we probably really expected. So I think what has been magical is we have used the cash, and it just kind of worked out really well in terms of the investments that we have made. We never expected this. It is why we didn\u2019t give guidance for the full year. the way we have approached COVID completely has been, look, there is an opportunity here, we are going to try to maximize it for as long as it is there. And eventually, we will get back to our other business. So I think we feel really good. I would also say the balance sheet is even stronger despite being able to buy shares back, done 5 acquisitions, we will still generate a meaningful amount of cash here even in the coming quarters. And candidly, we will probably hit a point where there is only so many more assets we would be able to metabolize in the recent term, especially in the Diagnostics and European footprints. So I wouldn\u2019t expect us to be continuing to try to gobble up as many companies in the coming quarters as we just have. It has been an opportunistic thing, but also no reason to pull back. We are not pulling back on any forward-looking plans. Karleen Oberton : Yes. And I would say we are not different from pre-pandemic. We had talked about focused on deploying our free cash flow to share repurchase and tuck-in acquisitions, so we will continue to do that even as the COVID testing comes down. Chris Lin : Okay. Great. And then for my follow-up question, I think your 10-Q mentioned that chlamydia and gonorrhea volumes were lower on a year-over-year basis. Could you just elaborate how sexual health testing volumes are tracking to pre-pandemic levels and when you see that fully recovering and I guess, specific to Q3, whether you have built into guidance for non-COVID-19 tests? Thank you. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So I think what we are seeing is that business is still recovering, that women still aren\u2019t getting back to their well visits at the pre-pandemic levels, coupled with a temporary guideline from the CDC about not doing a screening for asymptomatic women. So I think that is some of the pressure we see here in the current quarter. I think we are assuming that will continue into the next quarter, probably some improvement on well women visits, but we fully expect that, that business will recover as again we kind of get back to pre-pandemic life. Operator : And we will go next to Dan Brennan of UBS. Daniel Brennan : Great thanks for taking the questions. Steve, you talked about in the opening remarks how the company was growing 5% pre-COVID. And now, certainly, given the acquisitions and the installed base, you expect to be a higher level. I haven\u2019t heard the question asked, maybe I missed it, but can you elaborate a little bit on that? Give us a sense of what you are thinking about go-forward growth rate for Hologic? And any other kind of building blocks to get to that number? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. Dan, we are not going to articulate on this call exactly what that looks like. But clearly, as you know, for years, we were kind of in that three to four-ish range. We were moving it up into that five range. And I think as we look at what we have been able to do both organically, but really strengthened - the acquisitions we have been able to do put us a lot better off than if COVID hadn\u2019t hit, right. We probably wouldn\u2019t have bought Mobidiag, Biotheranostics, all of these things, all of which should be accretive to that growth rate. So do we see us moving a little north of that 5%? Yes. Are we ready to commit to an exact range? We have our June Board meeting where we will be looking at our strat plan with our Board. But I can just tell you the early roll-ups, I think we look at every business being able to be at least mid-single, if not moving into the higher single-digit and particularly with our international business. Now on a completely different footing than it ever was, we think we will be able to really drive all of our franchises stronger outside the U.S. So I think it puts us clearly north of 5, which I think is a very meaningful step-up for this company. It is not something we have had from a sustained growth, and I think that should not be lost. And I\u2019m glad you asked about it. Daniel Brennan : Great. Thank you Steve. And then as a follow-up, I know It is been asked a number of times. I\u2019m just wondering, given the COVID strength that you have had and obviously, the rate of decay that we see will be important for your top line results. But just how do you think about the right mix, if you will, of testing as we move out beyond this year into next and we get to a steady state on COVID between PCR and maybe rapid testing. I think you discussed earlier the accuracy is really important here, much more so than flu. So we are just trying to try to think about what the right numbers to plug into models and kind of that aspect will help in terms of the mix that you see unfolding as COVID flows. Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. Thanks, Dan. I think consider us biased because we are in the molecular space. But I think as more and more people have had bad experiences candidly with rapid tests. And I think all of us know a number of people who have had false results. I think the dynamic is going to play out where there is going to be less people racing out to need the immediate test and to try to get something super quick. And as you move into a vaccinated world and more of an ongoing monitoring where a few hours isn\u2019t going to make a difference, I think it is going to evolve much more towards most diagnostic testing, which is you want to use the most sensitive and most specific tests. And we just think that is going to ultimately prevail and that a lot of the euphoria and urgency and design - even some of these people calling for - everybody would be taking a test every day, dah, dah, dah, you know what, it is just we don\u2019t see it that way. Ultimately, the market will decide and you can come back and slap us upside our heads if we are wrong. But I think we see it playing out as a more traditional market overtime where it goes to our advantage. Thanks. Operator : And we will go next to Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. Anthony Petrone : Thanks and few follow-ups on just all around Diagnostics and one on capital. Steve, maybe in the 200 to 250, if you could give us a break on U.S. and Europe I know, in the past few quarters, Europe, as it relates to COVID testing, was underweighted for Hologic, what was growing. So I\u2019m just wondering how Europe plays out when there is still heightened pandemic there? And then on Mobidiag and Diagenode, I\u2019m wondering what the combined installed base of platforms is there and is there a pathway to consolidating those tests on Panther overtime? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. In terms of the first part, the COVID, I think we will see Europe being a bigger percentage of our revenue probably this quarter than even the 40%, I think part of our business, we feel really good about the longer-term contracts we booked with Europe and obviously, with the rollout of the vaccinations not going nearly as rapidly there. I feel pretty good about the persistence of the COVID testing in Europe. And then Mike is waving his hand here. Michael Watts : So Anthony, on the second piece about installed base, you remember Diagenode, think of Diagenode as an assay factory. So the priority there is to really get their PCR expertise in those tests onto our Fusion installed base, right, which is roughly 15 or so, 1 5 percent, of the 2,600 that we have out in the field. Mobidiag is a little bit of a different situation. The focus there is really on their Novodiag instrument, which is the more rapid turnaround instrument, and they are really just getting started with a relatively small installed base, even in Europe. And in the United States, I don\u2019t think they have any revenue, so there is clearly some big opportunity there on that Novodiag instrument. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. It will be more focused on driving that instrument than necessarily taking their stuff over to Panther. Thanks. Anthony Petrone : Understood. Thank you. Operator : And we will go to that last question from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [Cindy] on for Vijay. We notice the gross margin this quarter was down about 200 basis points sequentially. Could you - drivers behind that decline? Karleen Oberton : Yes. That is simply just because of the lower COVID revenue. So COVID revenue was about 745 million in Q1 and 680 million in Q2, so that decline in that very accretive gross margin revenue was the reason for the decline. But note, it is still at - 75% is pretty exceptional. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Operator : And we will go to Ivy Ma of Bank of America. Xiaoxiao Ma : Hi, thank you for squeezing me in. So just wanted to follow-up on the broad screening opportunity. Steve, as you mentioned earlier, the school programs sort of got delayed. So just wanted to see if there is any details you could share around upcoming catalysts and when we could expect those would be helpful. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think the broad approach we are taking is just trying to be there for our customers. If some get the school contracts, that would be great, we will be there for them. If they don\u2019t, we will be supporting other stuff. So I think that is probably the only potential bigger catalyst, I think, Ivy on the horizon, and obviously, that will really kick in for the fall. But I think there will be ways that, obviously, we will be working with various customers to be able to help support any of those initiatives. Karleen Oberton : Yes. And we have the pooling claim as well, which will be helpful for those screening programs. Xiaoxiao Ma : Great. And a quick follow-up for Karleen. Could you maybe comment more on the margin profile of the recent acquisitions and any opportunities for margin upside from those and how long those might take? Thank you. Karleen Oberton : Yes. I think we had talked about Biotheranostics is probably a little accretive to the overall gross margin profile of the company, but more in line with diagnostics. And I would think that Diagenode, at this point, may be a little less than the overall average and Mobidiag would be a little less than the average at this point. But those are things that as we build those installed base and grow those revenues they should get in line. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today.

These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those are referenced in the Safe Harbor statements that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue which we define as constant currency revenue excluding the divested Blood Screening business as well as year one revenue from acquired businesses currently Acessa, Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Mobidiag. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss today will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic\u2019s CEO. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We posted excellent results overall, driven by strong rebound in our base businesses and continued contributions to fight the ongoing COVID pandemic. Total revenue was $1.17 billion, up 38% and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.33 up 77%. We significantly exceeded our guidance on both the top and bottom lines. Our revenue outperformance was broad based in the quarter. Our Breast and Surgical divisions both grew substantially versus the prior year period when results were negatively affected by the pandemic. And importantly, both businesses also grew compared to the same period of 2019. Our Diagnostics division grew about 20% compared to last year, despite lower sales of COVID tests and increased compared to 2019 as well. Karleen will review our full financial results today, but before she does, I want to take a step back and provide some perspective on where Hologic is headed over the longer term, as many of you have requested. As mentioned in our last call, we have been working through our annual strategic planning process, and based on this, I've never been more excited about our future and the global impact we are making by pursuing our purpose, passion and promise. We know this is important to all our investors and especially those focused on ESG priorities. Hologic is clearly emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic as a stronger, faster growing company. We have a much higher profile on the global stage, which has helped create a stronger and more durable foundation to accelerate our international growth. And we have placed hundreds of new Panther instruments, which is boosting our razor and razor blade business model. From a financial perspective, we have generated more than $2.5 billion dollars of operating cash in just the last five quarters. During this time, we have used about $1.35 billion to buy six companies and about $510 million to buy back our own stock. In Diagnostics alone, we have added two new growth platforms in Biotheranostics and Mobidiag and substantially increased our assay development capabilities with Diagenode. Based on all this progress, we are now targeting organic revenue growth rates of between 5% and 7% in our base businesses between now and 2025. This excludes sales of COVID assays and related ancillaries, which we expect to decline over our strat plan horizon. Now we'd like to discuss how we expect this to play out in our three divisions. This is more detail than we typically provide in a quarterly call, but it's important to underpin the enthusiasm we have for our future. First, in Diagnostics, we are diversifying our customer base, installing more Panther instruments, continuously adding new assay menu and driving testing demand. Our foundation in diagnostics remains rock solid with leading U.S. market positions for our ThinPrep Pap Test and our key women's health assays on the Panther instrument, namely chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV and Trichomonas. As leaders in these categories, we have built strong partnerships with many of our largest lab customers that enable us to educate physicians about testing guidelines issued by groups like the CDC. Just last week in fact, the CDC posted new recommendations that are very positive for public health and for our business. So while our market shares are already very high, we are driving growth by expanding addressable markets. In addition, we have developed related women's health tests that are often performed from the same patient's sample, such as our vaginosis panel and our test for mycoplasma genitalium. Finally, we see significant opportunities to increase sales of other products where our market shares are much lower today. Our response to the COVID pandemic has unquestionably enabled us to accelerate these growth strategies. We have grown from a successful niche player in STI testing into a much more diversified industry leader with a broader customer base. We have done this by dramatically increasing placements of Panther instruments. Since the start of the pandemic, we have increased our global installed base by more than 50% or in real numbers by almost 1000 Panthers. We now have about 1500 Panthers in the United States and more than 1200 in other countries, and we are well diversified across customer sizes and types, and as COVID testing wanes customers are beginning to use these instruments to run more non-COVID assays. This is a significant opportunity, because today about half our customers from the largest reference labs to smaller hospitals run three tests or fewer on their Panther instruments, even though we now have 19 total assays available. We are capitalizing on this opportunity by signing up record levels of new business, as reflected in the test of record, or TORs metric that we have discussed. Pre-COVID, our best year for TORs was a little more than $20 million. Last fiscal year, we set a new record with about $35 million of new business and we are on track to comfortably exceed that number in 2021. Outside the United States, where Hologic Diagnostics has been less well-known historically, COVID has materially elevated our profile. Since the pandemic began, about a third of our COVID assay sales have been generated internationally and the relationships we have established will help us win business and drive future growth. Finally, the strong cash flow we've generated from COVID sales has enabled us to complete three recent acquisitions in Diagnostics, that together are expected to contribute more than $100 million of annual revenue, as well as providing new growth platforms that increase our top line growth rate. First, Biotheranostics enables us to enter the lab-based oncology space, a long time area of interest that has been growing rapidly. Biotheranostics is off to an excellent start with about $13 million of revenue in the third quarter, more than 30% higher than their best quarter prior to the pandemic. Second, Diagenode will help us add PCR-based menu to our Panther Fusion instrument, both in Europe and the United States. And third, the acquisition of Mobidiag enables us to enter the rapidly growing market for acute care, near-patient testing, which we have been monitoring for years. We believe the Novodiag instrument provides the right combination of ease-of-use, rapid turnaround, and low manufacturing cost to expand in the smaller hospitals and create a multi-hundred million dollar product line over time. Now let's shift gears and discuss our Breast and Skeletal Health division, where revenue growth is becoming more diversified, more recurring, more global, and more consistent than ever before. Similar to Diagnostics, our strategic plan is built on a foundation of strength. We are the leaders in breast health based on our long history of innovation, partnership with customers, and focus across the continuum of breast care. Our strategy is built around innovative market-leading Genius 3D Mammography platform. Like all our key products, our Genius exam is making a real difference in women's lives. They detect more dangerous cancers while reducing unnecessary callbacks. A few years ago, many investor questions focused on whether we could overcome the 3D cliff [ph] that was thought to be inevitable once the market converted to 3D. We don\u2019t get that question much anymore, because we have leveraged our leadership in 3D to creating much more diversified business with more consistent steady revenue growth. In fact, in the third quarter, U.S. gantry sales represented less than 20% of global breast health revenue. We have accomplished this in four ways. First, we've expanded our service business. If we think of breast health service as a single product, it would be the company's second largest with more than $500 million of global revenue over the last four quarters. While we don't expect this to grow dramatically over our strategic planning horizon, service will continue to underpin our financial results and be the cornerstone of the tight relationships we have with our customers. Second, we have beefed up our R&D capabilities beyond our traditional focus on x-ray imaging. We have developed new software packages like Clarity HD, which provides the industry's fastest highest resolution images. We have introduced new tools like Genius AI detection, a deep learning based software that helps radiologists detect subtle potential cancers. And we pioneered Brevera to fully integrate the biopsy procedure with specimen radiography for the first time. Brevera alone is now generating about $40 million of annual revenue, and we expect all these new products to drive growth over our strategic strat plan horizon. Third, we acquired four companies since 2018 to broaden our product portfolio, expand across the continuum of breast health care and become the partner of choice for all our customers breast health needs. These acquisitions include Faxitron, which bolstered our offerings in specimen radiography, and Focal which moved us further into breast conserving surgery, and SuperSonic Imagine, which strengthened our position in ultrasound, and SOMATEX, which increased innovation in breast biopsy markers. In aggregate, these deals are now adding about $90 million annually to breast health revenue and are important contributors to growth in our strategic plan. And fourth, we are expanding internationally in breast health. Our focus is to continue gaining market share with our existing 3D and upgradable 2D mammography products, the same products that have established leadership positions in the United States. We are also bringing the new products I've discussed, both internally developed and acquired to additional countries. And we've purchased distributors in Germany, Spain and other markets to get closer to customers and secure more service revenue. Now let's turn to our GYN Surgical Division. Surgical with our fastest growing division before the pandemic and our strategic plan assumes that surgical will continue its momentum through 2025. We have a unique opportunity to leverage our strength in the OB/GYN channel to provide differentiated solutions throughout women's lives. While today our products mainly help middle-aged women, in the future we plan to have a stronger presence among mothers-to-be and older women as we expand our offerings within the hysteroscopic, laparoscopic, and pelvic health markets. Within Surgical, MyoSure remains the world's leading hysteroscopic product to remove smaller, less complicated fibroids. Since July is fibroid awareness month, you've probably seen many articles describing the huge number of women who are affected by fibroids and the way they often suffer in silence or undergo invasive procedures such as hysterectomies. It's clear that this market remains large and underpenetrated and that after many years of exceptional growth, MyoSure still has plenty of room to run. We are also very excited about Acessa, which we acquired in 2020 and is laparoscopic fibroid treatment system. Acessa is a perfect complement to MyoSure as the system is used to treat larger, more complicated fibroids that MyoSure can't reach. Importantly, the same OB/GYNs who rely on MyoSure, have the potential to use Acessa, so it's a great fit for our sales force. We recently received two pieces of good news on Acessa that its now included in ACOG's updated fibroid management guidance and Cigna's list of medically necessary procedures. These are important milestones on our road to creating another $100 million dollar plus surgical brand alongside MyoSure and NovaSure. Another reason we feel confident in Surgical's future is the revitalization of our R&D pipeline. A few years ago, the division was basically a two-product show. Today, however, we sell multiple versions of these products, as well as new fluid management system, hysteroscopes and other GYN surgical tools and we have a robust pipeline of new products in development. Finally, based on the strengthening of our global commercial capabilities, we now have many opportunities to deliver our less invasive surgical solutions to women around the world, since less than 20% of the divisions revenue is generated outside the United States today. Before I turn the call over to Karleen, let me wrap up by saying that to me, Hologic looks like a fundamentally different company today than just 18 months ago, before the pandemic. We have three franchises growing faster than they ever have. We are growing in all major regions of the world. We have added multiple new growth drivers in all our divisions, and with our COVID tests we have a significant new product line to provide upside to a strong base. Taken together, we are excited for the future and confident that we will grow our base, non-COVID business between 5% and 7% over the next several years. Now let me hand the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. As Steve said, our third quarter results exceeded expectations as revenue and EPS grew significantly compared to the prior year. Revenue of $1.17 billion increased 38%. Organically revenue grew 34%, driven by continued sequential improvement in our base businesses in a meaningful contribution from global COVID testing revenue. We exceeded our top and bottom line guidance with upside in both our base and COVID. We also significantly improved profitability compared to the prior year period. As a result, EPS of $1.33 in the third quarter increased 77%. Further, operating cash flow remained robust, allowing us to execute on our capital allocation strategy, which I'll discuss more in a moment. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. Providing more complete picture of our performance, I will often compare our results to the third quarters of both 2020 and 2019. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $665.5 million grew an impressive 20% compared to the prior year period based on higher than expected COVID sales and the strength of our core molecular franchise. Within Diagnostics, molecular diagnostics increased 11.9% globally as massive growth internationally more than offset the decline in U.S. COVID sales. Although COVID testing revenue declined, it still exceeded our most recent guidance. Specifically, we shipped about 14 million COVID tests to customers, generating assay revenue of $291 million globally. About two thirds of COVID assay revenue was generated outside the United States in the quarter, reflecting the broader global footprint that Steve discussed. To better understand the underlying performance of our non-COVID businesses, let me remind you that the pandemic has also increased sales of collection kits, instruments and ancillaries that are used with our COVID tests. Backing this revenue out of the current and prior year periods provides a better picture of true underlying trends. If we do this, we see that base molecular revenue in total Diagnostics sales grew about 76% organically in the third quarter. Compared to the same quarter of 2019, molecular grew in the mid teens and total Diagnostics grew mid single digits. Rounding out Diagnostics, our Cytology & Perinatal businesses grew 75% compared to the prior year, but compared to 2019 these businesses were still slightly behind their pre-pandemic levels. In Breast Health, global revenue of $349 million grew 53% and exceptional results as the franchise continues to gain momentum. As evidence of this, revenues have now increased sequentially and compared to 2019 for the last three quarters. The division's strong performance remains well rounded, reflecting our commitment to diversifying revenue streams as Steve discussed. Both breast imaging and interventional businesses increased compared to the prior year period with imaging growing 43% and interventional increasing 120%. Although we remain encouraged by continued improvement in the capital environment, capital is still not quite back to the 2019 levels. However, breast screening rates continued to improve and with the healthy backlog we are encouraged about continued recovery over the next few quarters. In Surgical, third quarter revenue of $127.9 million to 143%, while also exceeding 2019 levels by low double digits. Surgical's strong performance has been driven by normalizing procedure volumes, MyoSure and new products in the hands of our exceptional sales force. Lastly in Skeletal, revenue of $25.9 million, increased 66% compared to the prior year period. It was also up low single digits compared to 2019. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $749.9 million increased almost 14%. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 10%. Outside the United States, sales of $418.4 million increased 137%. Organically sales Outside the U.S. grew 131% a tremendous result. Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 66.1% increased 140 basis points, driven by volume recovery in our base businesses, and a nice contribution from sales of our COVID tests. Continuing down the P&L, total operating expenses of $310.1 million, increased 19% in the third quarter. Excluding expenses from our recent acquisitions, operating expenses would have increased about 11% as we reinvested for our future growth incremental spending in R&D and marketing. In addition, remember that given uncertainties associated with the pandemic, we cut back on spending in our third quarter of 2020. Out non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.5%, driven by a favorable geographic income mix, mainly sales of COVID tests outside the United States. Putting this altogether, operating margin increased 650 basis points to 39.5% and net margin increased 580 basis points to 29.5%. As a result, non-GAAP net income finished at $344.8 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.33 exceeding the top end of our guidance. Before we cover our fourth quarter guidance, I'll quickly touch on few other financial metrics. Driven by a strong performance of our base businesses, as well as the contribution from COVID testing, cash flow from operations were $663 million in the third quarter. This was nearly double our non-GAAP net income, highlighting excellent cash conversion. These strong cash flows continue to give us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, in the third quarter we closed the acquisition of Mobidiag for an enterprise value of $808 million, and also repurchased 3 million shares of stock for $188 million. Overall, we had $828 million of cash at the end of the third quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.7 times. We intend to continue using our cash on division-led, tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases that improve our top and bottom -line growth rates. Finally, ROIC was 34.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 2,190 basis points. Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and provide a few comments on longer-term targets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect strong financial results again, with total revenue in the range of $1 billion to $1.04 billion, representing constant currency decline of 27% to 24% versus the prior year period, which benefited from huge COVID assay sales. For perspective, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we generated less than $800 million of revenue excluding the divested Cynosure business, so we expect to grow significantly above pre-pandemic levels. In our base businesses, we expect continued momentum and recovery to generate very strong growth rates compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, given the negative impact of the pandemic a year ago and we expect these franchises to grow nicely compared to 2019 as well. In terms of COVID assay sales, the U.S. testing market continues to decline as we forecasted last quarter, and we expect this trend to continue as more people are vaccinated. In addition, summer vacations may further reduce demand domestically and in Europe. With these factors in mind, we expect COVID assay sales to range from $150 to $170 million in the fourth quarter. In addition, COVID related items in Diagnostics are expected to be approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter, down roughly $20 million sequentially. If new variants drive demand that exceeds our current expectations, we are well-prepared to deliver for our customers and generate upside to our estimates. Our fourth quarter guidance includes approximately $35 million of acquired revenue from Mobidiag, Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Acessa. Backing this out, as well as $9 million of expected Blood Screening revenue, we expect organic revenue to decline 30% to 27%. But excluding COVID assay sales and related revenue, we forecast organic revenue to grow low-to-mid-teens in the fourth quarter. Below operating income, I would point out that we expect other expenses, net, to increase to about $25 million in the fourth quarter. Our guidance is based on a tax rate of 21.5%, and diluted shares outstanding of $260 million for the quarter. All this nets out to expected EPS of $0.92 to $1 in the fourth quarter. Given the outsized impact of COVID assay sales in the prior year period, this translates to a decline of 56% to 52%. As you update your forecasts, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporates both potential upsides and downsides. Before we open up the call for questions, let me touch on a few longer-term items. As Steve discussed, based on our recent strategic planning process we are confident that organic revenue can grow 5% to 7% through our fiscal 2025, excluding sales of COVID assays as well as the related ancillaries and instruments. Many of you have also asked for our perspective on COVID assay sales next year. And the shortest, most accurate answer is, we don\u2019t know. No one does, given the significant uncertainties that still exist and that seemingly change on a weekly basis. Having said that, we do understand your desire for some kind of framework. Toward that end, we believe that given the scope of the ongoing pandemic and our broad global installed base of Panther instruments, it is unlikely that COVID assay's revenue will be much less than $200 million next year, which would make COVID one of our biggest molecular assays. It\u2019s certainly possible that sales could be more than that, maybe as much as double, but we are going to be conservative at this stage and consider anything above $200 million potential upside. We would encourage you to do the same, and focus instead on the strong underlying growth rates in our base businesses that Steve discussed. Let me wrap up by saying that Hologic showed tremendous growth in the third quarter, with results that exceeded guidance. We continue to make a huge impact on women\u2019s health globally and are meeting COVID testing needs as the pandemic evolves. Further, with organic investments and multiple acquisitions, we are emerging from the pandemic as a stronger company with top-line growth rates of 5% to 7%, excluding COVID impacts. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Certainly. [Operator instructions] We'll go first to Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey thanks. A question that I get often on guidance, both near term and then the longer term outlook. So the fourth quarter guidance you are a bit below consensus at the midpoint of both revenue and earnings. You know a lot that's obviously the COVID roll off, but I just want to make sure there's not any deterioration model for the base business in the fourth quarter outlook. And then longer term the 5% to 7% growth, obviously you've got easy comps from 2021 as it was still impacted heavily by COVID. So should we assume the core, non-COVID growth longer term and it could be at the high end or above, given the comp dynamic here in the near term? Stephen MacMillan : Sure, starting with the fourth quarter guidance Tycho, you should feel very good about the underlying trends in the base businesses. We feel really good about each of them and it's the COVID decline that really leads us and we're continuing to be conservative day to day. It's hard to exactly predict what's going on in the COVID world. Three weeks ago it looked very different than a week ago. So we want to continue to be able to get people to focus on our based businesses that we feel good about. And we don't want to go too far on the longer term piece, but I think saying 5% to 7% for this company is very different than where we've been. And yes, so the comps are a little depressed someone next year, but not dramatically given that some of our businesses bounced back pretty well, and I think we feel good about each franchise contributing steady growth as we go through that period. Karleen? Karleen Oberton : Yes and I would just add to that Tycho that some of the elements of our franchises are not back to the 2019 levels if you think about psychology or you think about NovaSure and some of our STIs that are related to well women in business, those are still getting back to those 2019 levels. Tycho Peterson : Okay that's helpful, and then a follow up on capital deployment. Obviously you've been very active on the M&A front, but you did repurchase 3 million shares this quarter. I'm just curious, how you think about M&A going forward? Do you have a pause here and would you shift more to buy backs given the valuation and the growth that we will see right out here? Karleen Oberton : No, I think the M&A pipeline is still certainly active. Again it's division led, so maybe a little more quiet on the Diagnostics front for a while, but the other divisions are certainly active and I think, given the cash flow Tycho, we can still continue to do both. We can still continue to do M&A and share repurchase and that strategy will continue. Operator : Out next question will come from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Great thanks, Steve may be one for you on the long-term guide, certainly I appreciate all the color there. One of the biggest questions we get, is just how to get comfortable with the pretty good increase in Panther placements, that utilization and beyond COVID I mean we've seen so many various systems see their installed base move higher as well. I guess when you guys work through the guidance, how do you think about this piece? I mean obviously, there's things like test of record that you look at and feel good about the attach rate in the near term and driving, healthy utilization, but maybe just talk about that dynamic? But again, there's a ton of systems out there, what would you kind of include in the guidance in terms of Panther winning out in terms of some of that share beyond COVID? Stephen MacMillan : Sure, Patrick, it really comes across on multiple fronts, some is actually the contractual obligations as we've placed these Panthers particularly to provide both COVID revenue with an ongoing basis. The other pieces and your right, there's a lot of systems out there now. The simple, my super simple way is the common sense talk to the customer approach and I think, you've been out there with enough of the labs as well to hear what is going to be important on an ongoing basis is the most highly automated instruments that provide the best level of tests. And it -- what has led us to really the unbelievable market shares that we have in virtually all of our businesses. But when you look at Panther, the automated platform, the incredible automation and particularly as labs start to look to the future, where labor is going to be tougher and tougher to combine. And so, what we continue to hear, is Panthers where they want to consolidate, and in the early days of COVID everybody went everywhere and got every machine, and every test that they could get and some are still bleeding off inventory from some of those, we just keep hearing over and over. The lab techs especially, they're still running out of inventory of other people's stuff. They want to consolidate on Panther, and I think we've got a multi-year long-term track record of delivering on that. This is not a pie in the sky, hey we just placed a bunch of Panthers in the last 15 months and think this is going to happen. It's what we've been doing for six or seven years, pre-Panther which is we placed more Panthers every year, as our customers get used to them, they want to put more and more stuff on them. So I think it's going to really help us emerge, all automated platforms, not the same all boxes are not the same. Panthers established itself in the high volume space, high throughput space for a good reason. Michael Watts : Hey Pat it's Mike, the only think I might add to that just briefly is, although we weren't aware when we put our strat plan together of the new CDC guidelines that were just issued I think last week, certainly those are helpful to our business when you think about things like the opportunity for universal screening around chlamydia and gonorrhea, when you think about molecular testing for Amgen [ph], when you think about molecular testing for BD [ph]. So, as I said that wasn't something we were aware of at the time, but it certainly speaks to our ability to work with our largest lab customers to drive primary demand and expense in those categories. Patrick Donnelly : That's helpful perspective, and then maybe just a quick follow up for Karleen, just on the COVID piece. Can you talk about the pricing another two thirds of the business that you mentioned is OUS, I know that was kind of shaken around 20 bucks, have the recent contracts been a little more in the mid teams? What is the right way to think about that and just pushing that forward on that $200 million floor for next year, how should we be thinking about pricing as we go forward? Thank you. Karleen Oberton : Yes, certainly, yes from Q2 to Q3 we saw that average pricing come down from 25 to closer to 20, given that dynamic of OUS being two thirds of the revenue, and I think what we'll see is that as we renew those contracts, we'll probably see pricing coming down and then as maybe reimbursement goes away, we'll have some pricing pressure, but I think, even if we end up with an average ASP in the low to mid teens that's still very profitable assay for us. Operator : And next we will go to Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Steve, a lot of details here, a lot of numbers, I appreciate the color. May be some -- a little bit more details on some of the assumptions behind the 5 to 7? That 5 to 7 over the next few years, are we starting at 5 and progressing towards the higher end or maybe talk a little of the cadence, which best plays it assuming for Breast versus Diagnostic versus Surgical franchises? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, I think Vijay at the highest level, we probably see each franchise being roughly in that range, some maybe a little bit faster and we don't see dramatic changes year-over-year. It's not frontend loaded, it's not backend loaded. So we're not ready to give formal year-by-year guidance, but let's wait until our November call, we'll give our 2022 guidance. But I think our underlying belief is as you well know, those are growth rates better than we were coming in, and we always said when COVID struck, we're going to emerge as a stronger faster growing company, and we feel like this is exactly what we see for each of the businesses going forward. Karleen Oberton : Yes and I would just add that to your point, Steve that historically it's never been all the businesses growing at these rates, it's been one of the other, so this is what gives us confidence and excitement when the growth rate is driven by all the businesses. Stephen MacMillan : Yes, which I think the magic of that as well Vijay and you know it from having lived through the Breast Health peaks and valleys, even surgical early on week and then kind of some good quarters and back down. I think we just see this profound underlying strength of each of the franchises, both domestically and internationally with a cadence of product flow and the installed base, and the service, where there's just a strength that has now existed and we've been building over time in each of the businesses and then supplemented with the acquisitions that are giving us effectively accretive to the top line growth rates more products in the bag, it's just, there's no magic to it but it's a lot of things coming together. Vijay Kumar : And so that's helpful Steve. And maybe Karleen one for you, what should the 5 or 7 on the top translate to the bottom line? I guess going back to some of the debates on the stock a few years ago, peak margins was a question. So where are we on margins right now and some CapEx logic and also in the double digit earnings growth trajectory? Karleen Oberton : Yes, so certainly I think if you looked at our historical trends prior to the pandemic of either a regular cadence and growing EPS high single low double digits I mean, I think -- I don't think that's an unreasonable expectation. I think if you go back to Q2 2020 kind of our last clean quarter before the pandemic, operating income was in the low 30s. Certainly as we move forward, any COVID revenue is going to be accretive to that percentage, but I do, I would also say that as we look to that 5% to 7% they are international can be growing faster than us, which is a little lower on the margin side and certainly acquisitions, probably over the near term are a little dilutive to that. Operator : And now we will go to Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to turn back to Diagnostics and get some color on the Panther trajectory. I think I got 2700 total systems now. It seems like you're still placing instruments at a higher rate than you have in the past and I just thought it was interesting given where we are in the pandemic. I'm curious to get your thoughts, how that will trend from here? And if you look at the systems I appreciate the color on test or record, but is there any color of how many are just doing COVID only inability to translate them to other things? Stephen MacMillan : So Jack, I think the -- as we look to call it next year 2022, yes we're already starting to think about, okay, where we would we place some Panthers. And I think, a little early to tell, but we're still seeing pretty strong demand. So I would expect 2022 not to fall off a cliff, even though we've just placed, literally four years, we're in about 15-16 months. And I think some concern that that would drop off. I think we'll probably still be in the 200-ish plus Panthers to be placed even in the next fiscal year. So we're continuing to see very encouraging demand, and I think part of what we're seeing right now is some of our folks picking back up that were running, flat out COVID, I don't think there's a ton of them today that are running COVID flat out. I think we're starting to see them picking back up as women's visits are starting to go back in. So part of the magic of the platform is and it's even with the batching not needing to batch, you can just start to get back to running a women's health as a viral loads or COVID tests all simultaneously. So I think we're feeling pretty good about that. Jack Meehan : Right, and sticking with molecular, you know the Mobidiag acquisition, can you give us an updated timeline for when you think Novodiag can enter the U.S. market, and as you look out to 2025, can you humor us with what you think the revenue contribution for this platform can look like here and how it sits next to Panther? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, I think the best way to think about Novo come to the U.S. is towards the end of that strat plan horizon. I think we've got a few years worth of work to get it. In the meantime, we do have installs in Europe, and already some more interest among customers in Europe since we've acquired in our sales force that already sells Panthers. So I think we see some opportunity to immediately inject even additional life into that. And I think, beyond that, I think as we said in the script, we do see this becoming a multi 100 million dollar business over time. That's probably closer to the end of that, the end of the strat plan horizon to particularly, we've really got to get into the U.S., to really get that -- those numbers. Operator : And now we'll take a question from Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys this is Dustin on the line for Brian. There's been a lot of talk regarding democratization of testing and in particular STI testing, where we're kind of seeing a number of diagnostic companies going after this market. Can you talk about your viewpoint on how the centralized testing plays and where do you think STI testing will kind of take place longer term? And as it relates to you guys, where does entering this market rank in terms of company priorities? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, I think, first off, we've established ourselves with a pretty strong presence in the STIs and there's always a lot of competition in every market we're in. There's also a lot of hype and talk frankly from companies putting projections out there that haven't necessarily operated for a long time in the real world. And at the end of the day I think we do see increased decentralization. We see opportunities for whether it's home collection or other stuff and we're positioned, both with our customers, as well as frankly just the decentralized footprint that we already have with Panther. So I think it's also important that it's back to the CDC guidelines that just came out last week that we also see significant market expansion and we're the ones have been helping to drive that over time. So there will be certainly more competition, more tests being done in different places and I think we continue to be there. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks, I appreciate that. And this kind of goes off in earlier question a little bit, but I'm wondering if you guys can give an update on the recent diagnostic acquisitions. Things seem to be going pretty well for Biotheranostics, but just looking for a general update of how integrations are going versus expectations, and how these businesses were doing in the years previously? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, I think Biotheranostics is a great one. We absolutely love it. It's right down the street here in San Diego, the integration has gone very well in our San Diego facility this week I've seen some of the Biotheranostics people. They are already well integrated with our team. And I think excited to be part of Hologic. Diagenode our team over in Belgium, we've been working with them really for five years. They've been developing assays. So we have great relationships there. And on Mobi, I'm exceptionally pleased with what we're seeing and hearing. Kevin Thornal and his team have made multiple trips over to Finland at a time when lots of people don't want to be traveling those kind of distances and masks and everything else. Our teams have been getting very close to the teams over there. So feeling really, really good and it's really the power of the division lead acquisitions where our teams were deeply involved in the diligence and getting to know the teams in advance and chomping at the bit to work together. So I think what's been need is particularly each of those three companies, the employees of each of those companies, I think have genuinely been excited to be a part of a company that's got our purpose, passion, promise and it's not just good old American company focused only on profit, but we've actually got a much bigger purpose. And I think particularly as we've done some of the deals in Europe that's been a big deal to the employees, and the same practice on the tax and SSI we've done a lot in Europe recently between Breast Health and Diagnostics and I think it really resonates with the teams on the ground over there. Karleen Oberton : And I'll just add in Surgical, our Acessa acquisition, there is some recent good news there. We've got guidelines from ACOG and coverage from Cigna, so we're excited for what that's going to do in FY 2022. Operator : And now we will go to Anthony Petrone with Jeffries. Anthony Petrone : Michael Watts : Anthony, are you there? Operator : And Anthony your line is open, do you have this on mute? Michael Watts : Well, move on. Operator : We will take our next question that will be from Tejas Savant of Morgan Stanley. Tejas Savant : Hey guys, good evening. So Steve, one on the Panther replacements for you, particularly in terms of the new Panthers that you're placing with new to whole logic customers. How has that mix evolved over the last few quarters and specific to those customers, can you share some color in terms of the menu uptake? Stephen MacMillan : Sure, we don't have the incredible detail on that, other then I would just say, frankly a lot of them are in place with existing customers, a lot with new customers. What we've been seeing on each of them is, they -- certainly a lot of the new customers, the initial impetus was for COVID revenue, but they've been qualifying and porting over the other assays as the COVID revenue is starting to come down a little bit and as frankly the lab techs have been able to come up for air and qualify things. So I think we feel very good as evidenced by the underlying trajectory of our core diagnostics business coming back. Michael Watts : Hey Tejas, it is Mike. If we look at our tested record metric as an indicator of what you're asking about, probably no surprise we've got a big chunk of [indiscernible] to new business coming in, that's our biggest selling assay as in COVID we've got a big chunk of HPV in the papillomavirus [ph] business coming in. But I think what's really encouraging is even bigger than that is the interest in our vaginosis, BV [ph]. So that's a little bit of reflection of what we are talking about before in terms of our ability to take existing menu and build out from it with a new test and often oftentimes comes from the same sample type, so that's been encouraging. Tejas Savant : Got it very helpful. And then a couple of unrelated ones for Karleen here. Karleen you spoke about sort of about $160 million in COVID testing contributions for the fourth quarter and then about $200 million as a floor for fiscal 2022. Can you just outline what your assumptions were around sort of potentially the Delta variant leading to an uptick in testing and perhaps even a relatively strong flu season, would that all be upside and are you seeing any pickup at all in the last few weeks in terms of a trend reversal because of the Delta dynamic? Karleen Oberton : Yes, I would say our approach to the Q4 guide was similar to what we did in Q3 was looking at our July actual, looking at what's contracted pretty much outside the U.S. as a commitment, and then looking at recent trends. So for the most part I would say Delta accelerating with the upside as well as the flu season would likely be upside to those numbers that we've provided. Operator : And now we will go to [indiscernible] of Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is John on for Dick. Thanks for taking our question. You've alluded today that with specifically on Mobidiag's competitive landscape you have, other companies pushing into this multiplex molecular landscape and I was wondering how we should think about the revenue ramp had before the kind of in for me and of course, it's going to be the leading growth driver in 2025, and also what was the contribution in this quarter? Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Sure. I think the -- we clearly do see it getting much bigger in the out years as we come United States. So it will be a few million a quarter right now. Part of that has been particularly in -- it is all European business right now. I think you'll see it build over the year. Now they had some COVID revenue last year. So again, the core business we see it picking up over time here and even starting if we're going to into the New Year. Unidentified Analyst : Got you and then, are there any other assets that you want to divest in the near-term may be again in the Diagnostics or on the European front seeing that the integrations of the markdown [indiscernible] as you know like most of it is all going well? Stephen MacMillan : I think we feel really good with what we have and it allows us to be opportunistic. There's nothing that we're lapping right now and we'll continue just to kind of keep our eyes and ears open. I would say I think we feel very good about integrating everything we have right now and that that alone, one way to think about it, we've accelerated multiple years of acquisitions in Diagnostics in a real short period of time. We did three deals in a three to four-month window announcing actual closing three deals in call it a six, seven-month window, that covered our next couple of years and some of what we were hoping to do. So we're now hot and heavy into the integrations and into the execution mode that we tend to be pretty good on the execution side, but we'll continue to keep our eyes open, but there's no gaping holes in our portfolio. Operator : And now we will go to Max Masucci of Cowen and Company. Max Masucci : Hi good afternoon, thanks for all the details today. Can you just give us a bit more detail around how the recoveries has trended for routine wellness and blood screening business lately, where that backlog stands and what's sort of impact are you seeing more recently just with the emergence of the delta variant? Stephen MacMillan : Sure, I think overall we've seen pretty good recoveries really in mammography. The core women's health, some of the sexually transmitted infection and Pap tests have not bounced fully back yet, and I think we see that as, it's opportunity for the future when they will get back, but I think we've seen a little more recovery on the mammography side, most places back close to 100%. I think they are very recent trends with delta we're seeing little pockets here and there of small hospital systems here or there and certain geographies that may not be scheduling extra visits right now and things like that. But I don't think it will be material to the quarter going forward. Max Masucci : Got it, and Mobidiag has allowed you to serve customers that want both low plex or higher plex testing capabilities in a decentralized setting, but just at an industry level have you seen rising demand for higher plex testing today compared to pre-pandemic times? And just as a followup, do you view Mobidiag as a bigger share taker or game changer in the low plex or higher plex segment in the market over time? Stephen MacMillan : Yes I think we think it is going to play very well in both, but certainly in the multiplex area over time I think it's going to be a great platform for us. The magic for us is, it does give us a completely new growth platform in addition to Panther. So we've got all the additional Panthers we've placed, now it will be building up the menu over time and getting those Panthers working at a higher rate while we -- and subsequently we'll start to bring in the Mobidiag platform, both frankly more around Europe right now it's largely just in a few northern European countries as we expand it across Europe and then ultimately bring it to the States. Operator : And we have time for one final question and that will come from Anthony Petrone again from Jefferies. Anthony Petrone : Apologies, just hopping between calls, I just have two on Diagnostics. First on the CDC guidelines, it sort of recommends universal screening, but it looks like it will be site-specific in terms of adopting that protocol. So just wondering how you actually see that rolling out? And certainly represents upside for the Aptima Combo STI franchise, but any thoughts early on what that can mean for tailwind? And the second one quickly on COVID testing, OUS some of your competitors have referenced tenders. I'm just wondering if the company is participating in tenders and what that kind of represents going forward? Thanks a lot. Stephen MacMillan : Sure, I'll certainly take the first, yes we are certainly involved in any of the tenders for COVID revenue. When we establish very strong relationships upfront, it's also well frankly our ability to serve our customers internationally as we said about two thirds of our revenue from COVID last quarter was international. We've built some very strong relationships and frankly the health ministers around the world have known they can count on us and they can count on Panthers to deliver. So we feel pretty good about being involved in those. And back to your first piece on the CDC we feel really, really good about these new guidelines. And specifically, while it leads it up to regional we've got couple of things going for us. First, our own Diagnostics sales team, the calls on physicians and also to educate them, but really more importantly going from effectively and opt into an opt out system. So there have been so many women who should be having these tests done on routine visits that have really had to be opted in and then all the default should go the other way. So is that going to affect this coming quarter? Probably not. We'll we significantly expand the market here in the coming years, we think so and we think it's a great move for human health because a lot of the young women when they are -- if they are at the doctor' s office and they are with their mum and the doctor is asking question about the sexually active to decide do I give this test or not, and therefore okay, wait, if the kid has to answer yes to get the test written. As soon as the default becomes hey, you might not be, but we're just going to order this test anyway, that is a much, I think a much better way for society ultimately to probably have better handle on what's really going on. Anthony Petrone : Thanks again. Stephen MacMillan : Great, thank you. Michael Watts : Hey Kathy, it looks like we've just got one more left in the queue. We can take that last question quickly if he is still there. Operator : Certainly. We will go to Ryan Zimmerman of BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : Hey Mike, thanks for squeezing me in. Stephen, Karleen, thank you. Just one from me\u2026 Michael Watts : Ryan, if I know it was you I wouldn\u2019t have done it, sorry about that. Stephen MacMillan : Thanks for hanging on as well, we couldn\u2019t have cut off. Ryan Zimmerman : Well, with that said, just one from me? So Breast growth, Steve you called out cliff, and certainly the percentage of sales, again for sales, gantry sales is declining and it kind of dull tales with BJ's question, how do you think about that growth rate over time given the long range guidance you've provided, can that move up from what people have historically thought of as a kind of low single digit, mid single digit growth rate within Breast as the dynamics of that business shift over the three years? Stephen MacMillan : Yes Ryan. I think what we're very encouraged by and give Pete Valenti who has subsequently retired from Hologic, but when he came into the company and joined me in early 2014, our entire goal was to eliminate the boom-bust, the cliffs and the peaks and all that stuff in the Breast Health business, and we've achieved exactly that going to a much more consistent business were both diversifying, but also by bringing additional ideas to the gantries where we continue to do want better gantries along the way make a much more stable. So I think what we see there is a core underlying gantry business and service business, but then also as we're getting into a little more of the disposable stuff and the Breast Surgery stuff and those things, whether it's a bit of Focal and trying to be the markers that SOMATEX brings, now Brevera with the biopsy which is the capital, but really then it has been needle [ph] use is adding these ongoing revenue streams that are a little bit accretive to that underlying market growth that we have. So is Breast Health going to be the fastest growing business? Probably not, but is it going to be comfortably in that range, I think we feel really good about it. Karleen Oberton : Yes Ryan, I think I would just add that internationally if you think about historically about Breast business was managed commercially with that of dealing that work that under Kevin Thornal who had a strategy to go direct, we're seeing that improve the international business, I think there are other markets we're looking to go direct and in general internationally our commercial capabilities continue to grow and believe that's going to be helped -- international Breast will be -- Breast growth will be accretive to the overall [indiscernible] division. Stephen MacMillan : And Ryan will yell at Mike afterwards being [indiscernible]. Ryan Zimmerman : Thank you. Michael Watts : Thanks everybody. We appreciate your time this afternoon. Operator : Thank you. This now concludes the Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to the Hologic's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sara and I am your operator for today's call. This conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Please go ahead sir. Michael Watts : Thank you, Sara. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Simon, our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them today. A replay of this call will be archived through December 3rd. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue excluding the divested Blood Screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by [indiscernible]. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our strong financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenue was $1.32 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.61, both figures significantly exceeded our guidance. Since this quarter marks the end of our fiscal year, we want to highlight some annual numbers and themes today. First, the numbers. For the year, total revenue was $5.63 billion, up 47% versus 2020. Non-GAAP EPS was $8.41, more than double the prior year. Some really big numbers and a truly impressive performance that was driven by our COVID test sales, as well as the recovery of our core women's health businesses. Along these lines, if you back out COVID test sales as well as revenue from COVID-related products, such as instruments and collection kits, we grew about 12% in the quarter, a very nice start versus the long-term guidance of 5% to 7% that we introduced in our last call. We believe we are well positioned for success regardless of the future direction of the pandemic. If it drags on, we have shown that we can respond aggressively and generate financial upside. For example, since the beginning of the pandemic, we have provided more than 130 million highly accurate COVID tests to our customers in more than 50 countries. And when the pandemic subsides, we can rely on a base business that has never been stronger or more diversified than it is today. Now let's turn to those annual themes. We want to focus on the strengthening of our major businesses over the last 12 months, as well as 2 very important social initiatives that help improve health access and equality. We're so proud of everything that Hologic has done to help fight the COVID pandemic. And the resulting financial success has made us a significantly stronger company for the future. Our core businesses are more diverse with more growth drivers than ever before. Our R&D pipelines are producing innovative new products and our commercial organizations are fully engaged. And our international business has emerged as a consistent growth driver with passionate teams on the ground who are building relationships and market presence all around the world. On top of all this, we have used the strong cash flow we are generating from COVID test sales to acquire companies that we expect to generate more than $150 million in revenue in 2022. Although these acquisitions are slightly dilutive to near-term EPS, we expect them to accelerate our top line growth rate. Now let's get into the specifics by division. First, in Diagnostics. Our Panther footprint continues to grow as we respond to the pandemic. In our fourth quarter, we placed 167 Panther instruments worldwide and about 650 for the year, well ahead of what we originally forecast. Our Panther installed base currently stands at more than 1,500 in the United States and almost 2,900 worldwide. Remarkably, this represents a 2/3 increase in our total installed base since the end of fiscal 2019, when we had about 1,700 instruments in the field. And looking forward to 2022, we continue to see strong demand for additional placements globally. Utilization of this growing footprint and leveraging our robust portfolio of 19 assays will be key to driving the business forward in a post-COVID world. Toward this end, in 2021, we signed up more new assay business in the U.S. than ever before. While our legacy women's health assays are leading the way, we also expect newer assays to make material contributions. For example, sales of our vaginosis panel almost doubled to nearly $30 million in 2021. We expect significant growth in 2022 as well, which would make this product our most successful diagnostics launch ever, aside from COVID. In addition, we completed the back to back to back acquisitions of Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Mobidiag in 2021, our first diagnostic acquisitions in nearly a decade. These deals are broadening our product offering and customer base and strengthening our R&D capabilities around the world. While still in the early innings, Biotheranostics continues to exceed expectations with sales of more than $16 million in our fourth quarter. In addition, the broad European launch of the Novodiag system represents a meaningful early achievement in our integration process, and we have already secured some encouraging customer wins. We are excited about opportunities to invest in these businesses in the near term and expect them to accelerate our top line growth in the years to come. Second, in Breast and Skeletal Health, we are well positioned for fiscal year 2022 and beyond. Our Genius 3D mammography systems remain the core of our business, and our market share remains very high. Despite COVID pressures, we placed almost 950 3D units in the United States in 2021. We now have a domestic installed base of almost 8,700, which we can build on with new software and hardware upgrades. At the same time, our business is now more balanced than ever as we operate across the entire continuum of breast health care; from screening and diagnosis through surgery and treatment. As a result, we are now less susceptible to the boom and bust cycle of years past and better able to capitalize on opportunities as demand continues to recover from the headwinds created by the pandemic. Third, in our Surgical division, we are executing on our plan to broaden the division from a two-product hysteroscopy business to a more diverse provider focused on the OB/GYN. In fiscal 2021, we broadened our portfolio by having Acessa, a laparoscopic fibroid removal system used to treat larger, more complicated fibroids that MyoSure cannot reach. We are pleased that insurance coverage for the Acessa procedure has steadily expanded. And with this tailwind, we expect to grow Acessa into a third important surgical brand alongside MyoSure and NovaSure. Taking another step forward, we are also very excited about the recent signing of an agreement to purchase Bolder Surgical, which offers additional laparoscopic devices. We expect this deal to close later this calendar year. Bolder offers a portfolio of advanced energy vessel sealing surgical devices currently marketed primarily in the pediatric space. Once the deal is closed, we expect to again leverage our strong customer relationships to grow Bolder sales in the OB/GYN market, which we estimate to be five times the size of the pediatric market. Bolder and Acessa represents solid examples of executing against our tuck-in acquisition strategy, using our strong cash flow to add products that leverage our existing channel strength and accelerate our growth. Fourth, let's discuss our international business, which was growing nicely before COVID, but has become even stronger, thanks to our pandemic contributions. Even excluding COVID, our international revenue has nearly doubled in just five years. And the business is positioned to continue its impressive strength of double-digit core growth. I recently had the pleasure of being with Jan Verstreken's leadership team in Dubai, as they made plans to kick off fiscal 2022. It was inspiring to see the deep talent that Jan has assembled and the passion for women's health that helps them build and strengthen commercial relationships. I saw business benefiting from tremendous leadership and from years of dedication, transitioning from a distribution model to direct on-the-ground commercial expertise. Further, the acquisitions of Diagenode, based in Belgium; Mobidiag based in Finland; and SOMATEX, based in Germany provide tailwinds to our international business going forward. Since the close of each deal, dozens of team members, including technical experts and leadership, have made numerous trips across Europe and across the Atlantic to ensure successful integration of these companies, all while dealing with strict COVID protocols, truly a global collaborative effort that we expect to accelerate growth for years to come. Now, let's shift gears and discuss two groundbreaking social initiatives that we launched this year and that were made possible by our financial success. These efforts represent unique ways that we can extend our purpose, passion and promise even further for the benefit of women's health. First, in May of this year, we launched Project Health Equality, a $20 million initiative to address the structural and cultural barriers that prevent black and Hispanic women in the United States from receiving the same quality healthcare as white women. By teaming up with leading non-profit groups focused on minority health, our goals are to drive culturally competent care, improve public health policy, increase access and ultimately decrease disparities that lead to disproportionate mortality rates for Black and Hispanic women. Second, in September, we released the findings of our inaugural Hologic Global Women\u2019s Health Index. As leaders in diagnostics, we understand the importance of data and know that what we can measure, we can improve. We also know that women's health has been overlooked for centuries. That's why we created the index. The first, to statistically represent the health of 2.5 billion women and girls worldwide. Developed in partnership with Gallup, the Hologic Global Women's Health Index is an unprecedented in-depth examination of critical markers for women's health by country and territory and over time. Notably, 60% of those surveyed, equating to about 1.5 billion women and girls, had not been tested in the last year for four common diseases that affect women' s health : cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure and sexually transmitted infections. As we share this kind of data with international leaders and health organizations, our goal is to provide an actionable, science-backed data road map for improving life expectancy and quality of life for women around the world. While we have made a tremendous impact around the world with our innovative products, the Hologic Global Women's Health Index may ultimately prove to be our most important accomplishment for women's health. We hope that sharing a little about these initiatives is helpful to all our investors, but especially those who are focused on ESG issues. We also are pleased to share that we recently received some recognition for our efforts as Investors Business Daily just named us one of their top 100 ESG stocks. Before I turn the call over to Karleen, let me wrap-up by saying that based on the stabilization, growth and diversification of our core businesses. We expect to grow revenue at least in line with our 5% to 7% long-term guidance in 2022. And on top of this, we have the potential for significant financial upside based on our sales of COVID tests. To state the obvious, our success in 2021 and our optimism for 2022 would not be possible without our 6,000-plus employees. I am incredibly proud of them for their continued dedication and resilience. In a year marked by day-to-day, hour-by-hour management of highly variable pandemic demands, Hologic continues to make an enormous impact on humanity. As I visit Hologic sites and talk to employees, the sense of pride, morale and engagement is palpable. The belief in our mission to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day is real. I personally have never been more proud or excited for our organization. As a reflection of our global leadership team's gratitude, in the fourth quarter, we provided all our employees a special onetime cash bonus regardless of function and level. In an environment where finding and developing talent is increasingly challenging, we've strengthened our talent across all levels of the organization with individuals who embody our purpose, passion and promise. To all of you around the world, thank you. Now let me hand our call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share our fourth quarter results that significantly exceeded our guidance. In our last earnings call, we said that while we were forecasting conservatively, we were well prepared to generate upside if COVID testing demand increased due to the Delta variant. And that's exactly what happened. Increased COVID test sales in the fourth quarter more than compensated for macro headwinds that have affected many med tech companies recently. Our fourth quarter performance demonstrates that we are in a strong position regardless of how COVID evolves. We benefit from our invaluable testing contributions as the pandemic drags on or from a strong base business when it wanes. In the fourth quarter, revenue and EPS were down compared to the prior year, when COVID-19 testing volumes will be near their peak. Total revenue of $1.32 billion declined almost 3% and 6% organically. But these figures mask the solid recovery of our base businesses. As Steve said, if you back out COVID assay revenue as well as collection kits, instruments and ancillaries that are shared by our COVID and other tests, revenue grew by 12% organically. This growth, which compares favorably to the 5% to 7% long-term guidance we provided last quarter, was driven by resilience across all of our divisions despite utilization pressures from the Delta variant and customer staffing shortages. EPS of $1.61 in the fourth quarter was down 22% compared to the prior year as expected, but earnings exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by about 68%. Underlying this, our cash flow conversion remains tremendous, allowing us to continue pursuing tuck-in M&A and share repurchase, which I'll touch on in a moment. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. To provide a more complete picture of our performance, I will at times compare our results to both 2020 and 2019 as well as exclude the impact of COVID-19 where applicable. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $8 36.8 million declined 11.5% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID assay sales and related items, worldwide Diagnostics revenue increased 5%. Although COVID testing revenue declined compared to the prior year, it still far exceeded our expectations as the Delta variant started throughout the quarter. In Q4 2021, we shipped about 21 million COVID tests to customers, generating assay revenue of $443 million globally. Demand in the United States was robust and represented about two-thirds of total COVID assay revenue. This dynamic highlights the breadth of our Panther installed base, our commitment to respond to customer needs, and our flexibility to capture testing demand wherever and whenever it occurs. To better understand the underlying performance of our non-COVID molecular business, I will again exclude COVID assay sales and related ancillary items. If we do this, we see that the base molecular revenue grew about 6.5% organically in the fourth quarter. Compared to the same quarter of 2019, molecular grew about 10%. Rounding out Diagnostics, cytology and perinatal grew 3% compared to the prior year. But compared to 2019, these businesses were down low single-digits as well-women visits have not yet fully recovered from the pandemic. In Breast Health, global revenue of $334.2 million grew 15% as the business rebounded from weak prior year period and showcased its increasing diversity in face of the latest Delta surge. Global breast imaging and interventional businesses increased with imaging growing 12% and the interventional up 27%. Furthermore, our strategy to increase recurring revenue continues to pay off as global service revenue was approximately 40% of the division's total in the quarter, nearly twice as large as global gantry sales. In Surgical, fourth quarter revenue of $122 million grew 21%. This strong performance was driven by MyoSure, which had another impressive quarter, growing in the mid-teens. While surgical procedures were depressed in August and September, the impact was far less than what we experienced at the beginning of the pandemic. In fact, compared to 2019 levels, Surgical was up mid-single-digits. Further, we continue to add products to the bag of our best-in-class sales force. The acquisition of Acessa and agreement to acquire Bolder set us up nicely for fiscal 2022 and beyond. Lastly, in our Small Skeletal business, revenue of $23.6 million increased 26% compared to the prior year period and mid-single-digits compared to 2019. Now, let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 69.4% exceeded our forecast, driven by higher-than-expected COVID-19 test volumes in the period. Compared to the prior year, gross margins declined 480 basis points. Total operating expenses of $353.2 million increased 28% in the fourth quarter. The recent acquisitions contributed about a third of this increase. In addition, we deliberately reinvested for future growth with incremental spending in R&D and marketing, spent $9 million on the one-time employee bonus that Steve mentioned, and made a $10 million donation to our charitable fund in the quarter. Finally, our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.5%, consistent with prior periods. Putting all this together, operating margin declined 1,120 basis points versus the prior year period, but came in above our forecast at a very healthy 42.5%. Net margin also declined 880 basis points, but was very strong, 31.6%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $415.7 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.61, far above the top end of our forecast. Before we cover our 2022 guidance, I'll touch on a few other financial metrics. Cash flow from operations was $465 million in the fourth quarter. This completed our best ever cash flow year as we generated more than $2.3 billion of operating cash in 2021. The strong cash flows continue to give us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, in the fourth quarter, we agreed to acquire Boulder Surgical for $160 million. And although we did not repurchase any shares in our fourth quarter, we have bought back more than one million shares so far in the first quarter of 2022. Finally, I should mention that we recently refinanced our credit agreement. This further strengthened our balance sheet and financial flexibility by extending the maturity date to 2026, increasing our revolver borrowing capacity to $2 billion and lowering our borrowing costs. Based on our strong operational performance, we had $1.17 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the fourth quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.6 times. We intend to continue using our cash on division-led tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases that improve our top and bottom line growth rates. Finally, ROIC was 32.6% and on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 1,410 basis points. Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our financial expectations for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2022. Although the pandemic remains highly unpredictable and we are not immune from the supply chain challenges you've been hearing about, we believe we have good visibility into the recovery of our base businesses as well as a valuable hedge to COVID-19 outbreaks with our testing revenue. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect strong financial results again with total revenue in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion. For all of fiscal 2022, we expect total revenue in the range of $3.75 billion to $4 billion, significantly exceeding our pre-pandemic sales. To help with your constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $2 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $25 million for the full year. In terms of our divisions, we expect Breast and Skeletal Health, Surgical and Core diagnostics, excluding COVID effects, to grow in line with the 5% to 7% guidance we provided last quarter. In Diagnostics, molecular should continue to lead the way based on our larger Panther installed base, uptake of new assays like our vaginosis panel, international expansion opportunities as well as the recent change in chlamydia, gonorrhea screening guidelines that supports opt-out testing. In Breast Health, we have quietly been adding multiple growth drivers through acquisitions and breast conserving surgery, ultrasound and specimen radiography as well as internal development of software and hardware upgrades. Further, we have significant opportunities to expand our 3D installed base and service business internationally. Finally, in Surgical, we expect MyoSure to continue to drive growth but to get help from a broadening portfolio of products such as Fluent and Acessa's ProVu. Boulder is not included in our guidance because the deal has not yet closed. In terms of COVID assay sales, let me remind you that in the last 12 months, we have seen testing demand increase rapidly then decline rapidly, then increase rapidly again. Said another way, demand remains unpredictable and a lot can change between now and the end of our fiscal '22. So we continue to forecast conservatively and strong base business. But we will act aggressively to meet testing demands when and where it arises. With this perspective, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $200 million in the first quarter of 2022 and at least $300 million for the full year. COVID-related items in Diagnostics are expected to be approximately $45 million in the first quarter and at least $120 million for the full year. Finally, COVID has given us the opportunity to discontinue certain older products in our Diagnostics franchise. We expect a headwind of about $11 million from rationalizing these products in 2022. Let me remind you that our organic guidance backs out acquired revenue until the first full quarter after the deals annualize, as well as revenue from our divested blood screening business. We expect blood screening revenue of $5 million to $6 million in Q1 and $20 million to $25 million for the full year. In total, we are backing out roughly $100 million of inorganic revenue for the year, which means that we expect organic revenue to decline 34% based on lower sales of COVID tests. However, to appreciate the underlying growth of our base women's health franchise, it's important to back out of organic revenue COVID assay sales related ancillary items and the small amount of SKU rationalization that I mentioned. On this measure, we expect revenue in 2022 to be at least in line with the 5% to 7% long-term guidance that we provided last quarter. Moving down the P&L. For the full year, we forecast our gross margin percentage to be between 63% and 65% and our operating margin percentage to be in the low to mid-30s. We expect both percentages to decline sequentially throughout the year since the vast majority of COVID testing revenue will likely be recorded in the first half of 2022. In addition, we have incorporated some inflationary pressure in our supply chain into our guidance. Despite this, for the full year, both growth and operating margins should be better than before the pandemic. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be flat to down slightly versus elevated levels in 2021, even as we absorb cost increases and continue to invest proactively in our acquisitions and our base business to drive future growth. Below operating income, we expect other expenses net to be a little less than $25 million a quarter. Our guidance is based on the tax rate of 21.5% and diluted shares outstanding of around 260 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected EPS of $1.15 to $1.25 in the first quarter and $3.55 to $3.85 for the year. As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Let me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted a strong end to our fiscal 2021 with the results in our fourth quarter that far exceeded expectations and guidance. With organic investments in multiple acquisitions, we are emerging from the pandemic as a stronger company with core topline growth rates of 5% to 7% and potential upside from COVID. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, and then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian Weinstein : Thanks for taking the question. I don't usually believe in public accolades for management team members on these calls. I don't think I've done this very often, but I just want to thank Mike for his work and his friendship over the last 14 or so years that we've worked together, going back to GenPro. Lots of history there. Enjoy your retirement. You've certainly heard it, Mike. Michael Watts : Thanks Brian. Brian Weinstein : Yes, of course. So, just to think about 2022 for a second, then I also want to ask a bigger macro question. But on 2022, Karleen for you, just want to kind of understand the core operating margin. I wasn't sure if you mentioned it right there at the end. I might have missed it. But if we were to sort of back out COVID-19 from both, let's say, 2021 and 2022, how is that core operating margin expanding? And what does that look like relative to pre-pandemic? Because it looked like on our method, operating margin may actually be coming down on the core a little bit. And I wasn't sure if that was acquisitions or other things that were there. So, can you just address kind of the trend in the quarter? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So, certainly, acquisitions are dilutive. I think we've talked about at least $0.10 in 2022. I think when we look at the core, we would expect that the operating margin would be at or slightly above where we - prior to the pandemic. I think we've referenced that 31.5% right at Q2 2020 as what to think about on the base business. But certainly, as we move forward, the acquisitions are dilutive. And while we're really pleased about the international growth, that is also dilutive to the operating margin profile. But certainly, our job is to continue to look for opportunities to drive efficiencies. Brian Weinstein : And then the inflationary pressures there, they are being offset or are those flowing through as well? Karleen Oberton : To some extent, offset, but some of it's dropping to the bottom-line as well. As we always have initiatives to improve cost, but then certainly, those initiatives are at the pace of these headwinds that we're experiencing. Stephen MacMillan : Brian, the other piece to keep in mind is what we kind of called out as well, with additional charitable contributions, extra employee bonuses. It was our - as you can tell, it was our fiscal year-end. It was a tremendous year, dropping an extra $0.01 or $0.02 to Wall Street at this point on an 8 41 number. It was probably not our top priority versus investing for the future. And you look in total, our R&D spending up significantly over 20% for the year. We really used it to make additional investments for the future. Operator : And our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Thanks for taking my question. Steve, maybe on the Q1 on the guidance. Maybe I'll start with the queue. Breast Health, can you just talk about the CapEx environment? It looks like imaging was down Q-on-Q. I'm just curious if there was anything in the queue, whether it was the pandemic impact that had some disruption. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. Overall, we feel really good. There were clearly some impacts on installations here and there as hospitals hunkered back down a little bit in that August-September period. We continue to feel good about the backlog and feel good about the overall trends within that Breast Health business. Vijay Kumar : One on the fiscal 2022 guidance, the underlying base is expected to grow 5 to 7, and I want to make sure I have these numbers correct. The total COVID contribution for the year, I think the guidance is contemplating about 420, including 300 of testing and 120 of others. Did I get those numbers right? And Boulder, I'm curious what the contribution from Boulder is, what the revenue run rate is and margin is? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So you have the 420 is correct, Vijay. There's no contribution from Boulder in the guidance as the deal hasn't closed. Operator : Our next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : First question, I'll stick with the guidance, Steve. Just as we think about Panther placements, do you think about being back to kind of pre-pandemic levels, call it, 190, 200 systems next year? And then, any rough guidance you can give us on pull-through versus the historical 240,000? Stephen MacMillan : Sure, Tycho. I think we continue to feel really good that we will not see a drop-off relative to historical placements on Panther's. And if anything, we'll probably do a little bit better than the number you just mentioned and therefore, probably a little bit better than even we've been doing the previous years going into it as global demand continues to be great. The average dollars per Panther, it's all over the place right now because, obviously, we have COVID running through a bunch of them. I think the logical expectation is we'd probably be a little bit lower than that 240 number, given the incredible number we've placed. Also, a huge amount of them are outside - if you basically look at it on a base business basis. I think what - with COVID, those numbers are going to continue to be good, but it's hard to predict for the full year, obviously, given where COVID will go. But I think what we love is they're out there, they're placed. We probably take a slight short-term dip on revenue per Panther in the short-term, while that continues to go up as they port our base assays onto those Panthers. So I do think as you're getting to the overall number of Panthers we have placed has got to bode very well. And the other reality is, we're all seeing about labor constraints. Do not underestimate - again, I know you know it, Tycho. But the fact that Panther is such an automated system. And I know there's ongoing questions of, okay, what's going to happen with all these Panthers once COVID runs down? Most of our customers are dying to get our base business on to these and for those labor savings opportunities. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then a follow-up on China. There's kind of two dynamics in the market there. There's China 2025, encouraging local competition. And then there's kind of the near-term dynamic around volume-based tenders. Can you maybe just touch on either both of those, and whether you're seeing any impact? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, I hate to say it, but I think we're a little fortunate in that we're pretty small in China and therefore, are not seeing big impact in the volume-based tenders, probably not coming quite after our categories at this stage in time. But I would tell you truthfully, it's a time I'm glad we're smaller there. We see opportunities to grow there, but we probably have more upside than downside as we look at that part of the world. Operator : And our next question will come from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : I wanted to continue on with Panther. It looks like just based on the disclosures, incremental Panthers in the quarter were placed internationally. Then just looking at some of Karleen's commentary around the U.S. versus international mix of the COVID sales. Most of the incremental sales actually came in the U.S., which kind of makes sense, I guess, because of the Delta. I was just curious maybe more broadly, you got thoughts around the international adoption of these Panthers. How much is getting used now for COVID and versus broadening the footprint for other things internationally? Stephen MacMillan : Sure. I think a lot of it in the near term has still been COVID. And even \u2013 there are a lot of hospitals and a lot of labs that even as they saw - started to see some declines pre-Delta, they were starting to ramp up our base assays and then decided we better stay loose. And so, I would tell you there's probably some Panthers being a little bit underutilized right now internationally because they don't want to start to ramp them up with our tests and then have to stop. So we feel great about that as basically on deck and ready to go as soon as they have the ability. It's one reason why the Panther placements internationally have continued to be very strong because they've gotten the exposure and they want to build up with our tests. So, I think feeling great that there has been - we've even had a number of customers in the United States as well that we're just starting in kind of July to start to ramp down the COVID, ramp up our women's health stuff. And then all of a sudden, time out, we want to keep this capacity for right now on COVID. Jack Meehan : That makes sense. Then on the Breast Health and the GYN Surgical businesses, they both came in a little below what I was expecting. I was curious if you could call out just what impact you think Delta might have had on the results in the quarter. And as you were thinking about the 2022 guidance, do you just \u2013 do you assume that was the baseline just when you were thinking about the 5% to 7% to grow off of? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. We did kind of view that in the baseline. They were a touch - obviously, as we saw the August, especially September, they had a little bit of an impact. Again, I think there's been way too much overall focus on the short-term ups and downs of COVID and what it does to the base. But I think overall, we feel very, very good about that core and about where we're headed as we come into 2022 on both of those businesses. And as Karleen and I both mentioned, those businesses are more diversified than ever, both product-wise as well as geography-wise. And I think that sets us up well here for 2022 and for the longer term. Operator : And next, we'll take a question from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Anthony Petrone : And I want to congratulate the team on a strong execution for the whole year. And congratulations as well to Mike Watts on your retirement. Good luck on the next phase of the transition. A couple of questions. One on actually the acquisitions, the $34 million of total deal contribution. How much of that was actually Mobidiag? And when we think about a quarterly run rate, I think the timing of Mobidiag was not a full quarter. So, should we be expecting a number perhaps in the $40 million to $45 million range for total quarterly contribution from recently closed deals? And then I'll have one quick follow-up on COVID testing. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So Mobidiag was roughly $7 million in the quarter. And so I think as we look to 2022, I think we talked about $150 million plus from all the acquisitions and about half of that is organic. Anthony Petrone : Okay, great. And then just on the newly placed Panthers throughout the pandemic, I mean how many of those systems are actually only doing COVID testing exclusively? And at what point do you think they will transition to just broader diagnostic contracts? Thanks again. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Anthony. The reality is we don\u2019t exactly know and track at that level of the Panthers. But what we do know is they've clearly been running, in many cases, not quite flat out, but close to it during the pandemic that all of which creates the opportunity as COVID ramps down for us to really shift over our base business. So, I think that's what makes us so excited about the future of Diagnostics. We had good growth rates going in. Particularly internationally, you've been seeing - we'd had double-digit almost 20% growth in our molecular diagnostics business for the last few years and numbers of quarters as we come out of the pandemic or even as things slow down to a more manageable level, which looks to be hopefully on the horizon here. That creates meaningful opportunity for more and more of our base businesses to really get ramped up there. Operator : And Derik De Bruin with Bank of America has our next question. Derik De Bruin : Hi, good afternoon and Mike, happy trail. It's been a pleasure. So, just on - just once again, another Panther question, but how much is greenfield versus people just adding on additional molecular testing capabilities versus replacements of - or swap-outs from competitors? Stephen MacMillan : So you're talking to new customers, completely new customers? Derik De Bruin : Completely new customers to - yes, completely new customers to testing that you've not been in the lab before versus people who have been doing molecular tests, who are adding systems or ones just beating out some competitor that's installed? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, the vast, vast majority, Derik, are customers that we've already been doing business with. When you consider our - just our market shares, as you well know in women's health, we're pretty much in most customers. There are very few customers, certainly in the United States that we're not in. So, it's really expanding their capacities. A few more greenfield outside the United States, which is new customers coming prospecting. But the vast, vast majority across the board really is our core business. Mike, you wanted to add something? Michael Watts : Derik, the only thing I might add is we are seeing a lot of customers add on new assays, of course, right? So, customers for our, say, women's health panel today, call it, chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV, but we're seeing a lot of excitement, in particular, around our vaginosis sale, which we the script as well as Amgen. So that's an existing customer, but they're bringing on a new assay or assays. Derik De Bruin : And then just one follow-up. What are you assuming for breast imaging growth in 2022? And on the services component at 40%, is there additional upside to that number? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I mean, I think the thing about that service is tied to our installed base in that as we even place new gantries. Now sometimes the replacements, they kind of come off a service for you, they have warranty. So, I would expect that the service would probably be a lower end of growth when I think about that division. But certainly, as I said in the prepared remarks, the overall division should be in that 5% to 7%. Operator : Next, we'll take a question from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Mike Matson : Thanks for taking my question. I guess I want to ask one about the COVID flu combined test that you've launched. So, do you see a scenario where if COVID, maybe we don't have another big wave, but we have kind of a worse flu season that you could still see kind of a benefit from that to that combined test? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. Mike, we're prepared - and when we said we launched it, we've had it cleared now, and it's ready to go for customers. We're still basically hearing from most of our customers. They want straight COVID test. As the months evolve here, do we start to get a bigger spike in that - the flu season? Clearly, I do think that we believe as you go forward this year, and let's face it, probably even next year, most people that are going to get tested for flu are probably going to end up getting tested for COVID as well. So, we will see how it plays out. We're assuming relatively small volumes as it relates to our multiplex test at this point in time until it starts to materialize. Mike Matson : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, I just want to ask about Breast Health outside - can you just maybe give us an update on where things stand with 3D penetration? And because from what I remember, there was a much bigger opportunity there to upgrade customers to 3D and some of the other newer software and things that you've offered - or introduced, sorry. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. 3D is still very low penetration rates in much of the international markets. And frankly, it's something that we hope the Hologic Global Women's Health Index will actually be able to start to highlight a little bit more, which is many countries outside the U.S. are still only reserving 3D more for diagnostic mammograms as opposed to screening. And frankly, many still don't have great screening programs in general. So we're able, ultimately through the Global Women's Health Index, I think to start to have more discussions about better screening programs, about the need for 3D. And the fact that 3D in many cases is economically advantageous over the longer term, particularly in single-payer systems, where the ability to detect earlier, treat earlier, avoiding all the false positives, the false call - the unneeded callbacks and all of that. So I think we remain very bullish over the longer term. It continues to be something that's going to play out over years, not quarters. Operator : Next, we'll take a question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Tejas Savant : Just a two-part around COVID to start with. Karleen, can you give us a sense of the impact on how we should think about pricing from the combo test launch? And the OUS mix here seems to have dipped sequentially in favor of the States? And what that means for margins? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So certainly, from Q3 to Q4 with the Delta variant, we saw an uptick in U.S. testing. About 2/3 were from the U.S. versus last quarter, it was 2/3 OUS. So obviously, that's a little bit more favorable on pricing, so a little more benefit on the margin profile. And then what was the other part of the question? Tejas Savant : It was on the combo test and - yes. Karleen Oberton : So certainly, that pricing would be favorable from the single test. But we've, to Steve's comments, really haven't assumed much related to that at this point given it seems like customers still just want COVID only. Tejas Savant : And then just a couple of quick ones on the recent deals. On Mobidiag, I mean, given the broader launch in Europe for Novodiag, Steve, how are you thinking about that installed base of 200 units expanding over the next 12 months or so? And then on Boulder, I think you called out sort of 5x higher LAP procedures versus the pediatric setting. So over what time frame do you think you can capture that opportunity? Stephen MacMillan : Sure. I think we're probably not ready to give exact numbers on Novo, but the initial sale is off to a good start. And we're just loving that acquisition so far. As it relates to Boulder, I think that will be a - clearly a multiyear journey to build up the market of that size. But I think the magic for us with both Acessa and Boulder is, as you know, we've long targeted surgical as an opportunity to put more into those sales force's bags. And I'm really proud of the team, Sean Doherty and Dan Essex more recently running that division and finally starting to make some good deals happen for that business. And the sales forces are excited. And I think it will create a great runway for years to come here in the surgical business. Operator : And our next question will come from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Thanks for taking the question guys. Steve, maybe just on kind of some of the macro uncertainty you talked about. Can you just talk about the different businesses? I know you guys have kind of that internal red light, green light for each segment, each region. Any segments that are maybe coming back a little slower than you expected? It certainly sounds like you're pretty confident on breast. But I just wanted to talk through the different segment recovery time lines and how you thought about those going into '22? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think the magic, Patrick, for the first time that I've been with the company, as we look at all 3 franchises and we look both domestically and international. So, if you just play that out in 6 buckets or 9 if you count U.S., international and then worldwide, they're all looking good in that 5% to 7% range, and there's not any major hiccups that are out there. So, I think we feel really, really as good across the board. There will always be a country here or there or a little business and those kinds of things. But overall, it's probably been as solid across the board as we've seen. I think that's part of what really gave us the confidence, frankly, on the last call, we put out the 5% to 7% guidance because there's always been \u2013 there was a little more red lurking in the \u2013 on the horizon there than \u2013 it wasn't as green across the board as it looks now. Patrick Donnelly : That's encouraging to hear. And then maybe just on the cash flow. You talked about over $2 billion in the year, another nice quarter here - exactly. And obviously, nice to see you guys buy back 1 million shares already this quarter. How should we think about your M&A appetite? Obviously, you've done a bunch of smaller deals, relatively small. But how should we think about your appetite there, continue with these bolt-ons? Any appetite for anything larger? Just wanted to talk through that. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. The appetite and the ability are certainly there financially as we look to continue doing tuck-ins. Just because we're generating a bunch of cash, doesn't mean, okay, we're going to start to go bigger, bigger. I can say the bigger things we're also thinking about right now is we're digesting a lot. So, there's also the organizational bandwidth. And right now, our international teams are incredibly busy. Kevin's Diagnostics team and frankly, the Surgical teams are all very, very deep into a lot of integration activity. So, the other factor that would be in our minds is ease of integration. So, if anything, probably a slower pace this year than last year as we really make sure that we optimize what we did last year. And as Karleen has mentioned, we're comfortable, continue to build a little cash here. We're not just going out and spend it because we have it. Karleen, do you want to build on that? Karleen Oberton : Yes, certainly. I mean, Patrick, we're going to maintain our discipline as it relates to M&A and make sure that we certainly want to do well on the deals that we've executed so far. So that will be a little bit more of a flux in the focus. But certainly, the division still have their BD teams out there identifying assets and if we find the right opportunity, we'll execute on it. Operator : And our next question will come from Max Masucci with Cowen and Company. Max Masucci : Hi thanks for taking the questions. I want to extend congratulations to Mike. So, on Bolder Surgical estimated $10 million in calendar 2021 revenues are around 2% to 3% of the annualized surgical revenues in fiscal Q4. So, I know it's a small product line today, but given the multiple on the deal, I'd imagine that the growth is already solid with the potential to accelerate as it's cross-sold into the OB/GYN channel. So, with that in mind, is there any way to think about how quickly Bolder's products could penetrate the OB/GYN channel? Or what percentage of your existing OB/GYN customers would be adopters? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. We'll probably give more of that once we close the deal. We're still obviously in the midst of - we'll probably close at the end of the calendar year and probably be in a better position, Max, honestly, to answer it next quarter. But clearly, it is growing pretty nicely. They've gotten some nice products approved over the course of the last 12 months. And we'll be very helpful in terms of the uptick. But it is - it's a new sale. It's going to take a couple of oftentimes one or two visits. And still, frankly, in some of these COVID constrained world, we want to manage our expectations upfront. We feel really good about the opportunity. Max Masucci : Makes sense. And I appreciate the color on Mobidiag. If we just think about the initial pandemic disruption serving as an accelerant for Panther placements globally, are there any parallels to be drawn between what you could see for Novodiag in the decentralized setting in Europe following the launch in early October? And then just curious, the role of the AmpliDiag instrument in the context of also having Panther? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think the Novodiag and the launch going on there, I think that's going to be the big opportunity for us as we go into the smaller labs, a broader menu and already feeling really good. Obviously, it's CE marked at this point. It's still a few years away in the United States, but feeling really good to be a nice opportunity to really drive the international business in the nearer term on that and then ultimately a big play in the U.S. over time. Michael Watts : Operator, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. And that final question will come from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : Thanks for squeezing me in on the end here. I'll just keep it to one. And so, it's for Karleen. Given the COVID assay sales guidance, $200 million in the first quarter, $300 million for the year, let's just assume that, that's kind of how it goes right now. I understand that, that's a very conservative estimate, but it would suggest somewhat of a drop-off in gross margins quite rapidly, Karleen. And so one - following the first quarter, I mean. And one is that the right way to think about it? But then two, how should we be thinking about the gross margin profile kind of net the assay contribution from COVID when we think about a kind of a post-COVID Hologic? Thanks for taking the questions. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So certainly, I think we said in our prepared remarks that we would expect margins to come down sequentially throughout the year as the COVID at this point is heavily weighted to the first half of the year. As I look at where we exit the year in 2022, the margins are in the low-60s on the gross margin and low-30s on the operating margin as we had indicated. So - and that assumes a pretty, pretty low COVID contribution as we exit the year as we planned for right now. Michael Watts : Thank you, sir. Thanks, everybody. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This now conclude the Hologic fourth quarter 2021 conference call. Have a good evening.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to the Hologic's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ron and I am your operator for today's call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations to begin the call. Ryan Simon : Thank you, Ron. Good afternoon and thank you for joining Hologic's first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website along with an updated corporate presentation. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. And a replay of this call will be available through March 4. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue excluding the divested Blood Screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Once again, our results are strong. We are off to a great start in all divisions with diagnostics, breast and skeletal health and surgical each delivering more than 8% global organic growth, excluding COVID revenue. For the quarter, revenue was $1.47 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.17. Both numbers significantly exceeded the high-end of our guidance by 28% on the top-line, and 74% on the bottom. Over the last several quarters. And most recently at the JPMorgan conference, we've been communicating three major themes. First, our base business is stronger, with more diverse growth drivers than ever before. Second, as the COVID pandemic remains, we continue to help meet the world's testing needs and generate financial upside. And third, because of the first two points, we are well positioned to generate strong results regardless of how various uncertainties evolve from the pandemic, to supply chain challenges to health care utilization. In other words, you can count on us to deliver in today's uncertain business environment. These themes are certainly playing out as we look at our first quarter results and our dramatically improved outlook for the fiscal year. Our base businesses are performing well. And we are making a massive difference against COVID. As a result, we are raising our revenue and earnings guidance significantly as we expect upside from COVID-19 testing, along with strength in our diagnostics and surgical businesses to more than compensate for temporary supply chain challenges that have emerged in our breast health business. As we shared at JPMorgan, we are a fundamentally different company than eight years ago. Now more than ever before, Hologic has more diverse and higher margin recurring revenue across each division in each geography around the world. Our strong performance is result of execution against our strategic plan and has been accelerated by our financial success during the pandemic. As evidenced by our Q1 results, we are well positioned for long term sustainable growth, regardless of the direction the pandemic may turn. While we can't predict the future path of COVID, we'd like to expand today on what we do know that Hologic is emerging from this pandemic a much stronger company. More specifically, we will focus on what we know in each division. It gives us clear confidence in our ability to maintain sustained growth over the long-term. First, in our diagnostics division, we know that our huge industry leading installed base of automated high throughput Panther systems, along with our robust menu of 19 assays across Panther and Panther fusion, will drive strong growth well into the future. Today, our Panther installed base is over 3000 units 75% larger than prior to the pandemic, with almost half of these placed internationally. Of note, demand for our Panthers is still strong globally. We placed well over 100 Panthers in the first quarter alone, more than double our pace prior to the pandemic. At this stage in the pandemic, this clearly indicates the customers expect to use these systems for non-COVID testing. Utilization of our Panther systems is also strong. We are seeing clear signs that customers are leveraging our menu of 19 assays on our significantly expanded Panther footprint. First and foremost, the growth of molecular diagnostic sales reflect this growing utilization. For Q1, our core molecular diagnostics franchise grew 14% worldwide, excluding COVID revenues, product discontinuations, as well as recent M&A activity. Now, we know a question on some people's minds is, will these Panthers be used post pandemic? The answer is an emphatic yes, based on the following. First, nearly 90% of U.S. COVID customers are already running at least one other assay. This speaks to our customers being bonafide molecular diagnostics players who are invested in molecular testing for the long haul, and who we expect will adopt more of our assays over time. And second, the incredible automation and workflow simplicity of the Panther, which dramatically minimizes labor activity and costs. In a labor restricted world, our customers realize the enormous advantage of our Panther system. Extending and broadening the adoption of our portfolio of assays is a fundamental element of the diagnostic growth strategy. Our sales teams have done a tremendous job winning strategic accounts, strengthening our relationship with customers, and fueling our razor, razor blade business model with both legacy women's health tests and new assays. As an example, leveraging our leadership in women's health, our vaginitis panel is off to a great start with $13 million of revenue in the first quarter, roughly 2.5x the first quarter of 2021. We are extremely proud of the panel success and believe this will be our most successful diagnostic launch ever COVID aside. In Q1, we also once again responded to our customers COVID testing needs and generated significant financial upside. We posted $523 million in COVID assay sales, over $300 million more than our outlook and consensus. Clearly COVID is sticking around longer than anyone would like. And just as clearly, highly accurate molecular testing continues to play a major role in fighting the pandemic. We continue to believe COVID testing will contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. And we remain prepared to meet ongoing demand globally. Second, shifting to our breast and skeletal health business. We know that broadening across the continuum of breast health care from screening and diagnosis through surgery and treatment has transformed this franchise from a once capital dependent business to a division with more diverse, higher growth recurring revenue. In the first quarter, the breast health business grew 8.4% As we've maintained our high market share, and continued to grow our installed base of Genius 3D Mammography systems. The attachment rate of service on this gantry base continues to remain strong at more than 80%, making service one of our largest top line contributors company wide. And we continue to upgrade our installed base with high margin software and AI. So mammography capital business is and will continue to be a meaningful and foundational part of our breast business going forward. In addition, we built a solid adjacent portfolio of more recurring interventional breast surgery products that is driving the growth of the division. These interventional products include markers, needles, including those used in our Brevera biopsy system, and handheld devices. Sales are more recurring in nature, with higher projected growth compared to the legacy capital business As points of reference, today, the gantry business is only 23% of breast health revenue compared to 29% in 2014, and interventional sales have grown to roughly the same size as gantry revenue. We expect the interventional business to continue its growth and further transform our breast and skeletal division going forward. The increasing diversity of our breast business will help us offset supply chain challenges that have emerged recently, specifically shortages of computer chips in our mammography and other imaging systems. Our updated guidance incorporates a temporary but meaningful revenue headwind for the balance of our fiscal year. Despite this, as Karleen will discuss, we are raising our revenue and EPS guidance significantly based on outperformance in COVID, core molecular and surgical. Now, shifting gears to surgical, we know that the diversification of the business will drive growth. Despite pandemic headwinds, the division grew 8.2% In the first quarter, and we continue to solidify our market leading positions for NovaSure and MyoSure. With the addition of the Acessa procedure and the close of the Bolder acquisition in late November, our surgical business has a very different profile today, with more growth engines than ever. Acessa of revenue in Q1 was nearly three times a year ago and the Bolder integration is off to a great start. As we are already seeing Bolder sales through the Hologic surgical sales team. The recent launch of NovaSure version five, developed in-house is also seeing good traction. It's early days, but we are seeing a lot of excitement in the field around this product. We are committed to maintaining our leadership position in this space with best-in-class products. Further, the Fluent Fluid Management System, also developed in-house is used to streamline the complexities of fluid management in hysteroscopic procedures. Fluent is another great example of organic innovation, driving future growth. Fourth and finally, we know that our international business will be a consistent contributor of growth for years to come. We are no longer the export business of prior years. Through organic growth, and M&A, we are direct in more regions than ever before, especially in breast health, with our feet firmly on the street and engaged with customers. In Q1, the international business achieved nearly 13% organic growth, excluding COVID. And we expect strong growth to continue. With the leaders we have in place today. We are confident the foundation we've laid and the progress we've made will yield strong results for many years to come. To add additional perspective, there are over 3.9 billion women in the world with only about 170 million of them in the United States, which is our largest market today. Clearly, we have an opportunity to impact more lives and more women around the world. Through our groundbreaking initiatives, like the Hologic Global Women's Health Index, in conjunction with the opportunity we've earned as leaders in the fight against COVID, we are connecting with world leaders and changemakers to elevate Women's Health around the world. In summary, our first quarter results and improved outlook demonstrate the Hologic is a much different and much stronger business than ever before. Stronger through diversification and stronger from our leadership in COVID molecular testing. These factors are generating exceptional cash flows and a pristine balance sheet that are especially valuable in the midst of uncertain market conditions. As we've done for the duration of this pandemic, we are confident in our ability to manage our business through various uncertainties and continue to deliver strong growth regardless of how external conditions evolve. What is clear to us at Hologic is that we are poised to continue our strong growth, whether COVID wanes or continues, we have fundamentally changed our business into one with more growth drivers and more recurring revenue across all geographies. This gives us the clear confidence that we can navigate change and continue to generate exceptional financial results. With that, let me turn the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share first quarter results that are significantly exceeded our guidance on both the top-line and bottom-line. Our first quarter highlights an improving based business that grew 9% organically excluding COVID-19 revenues. As Steve mentioned, our diversified business model is paying off. Each of our franchises excluding COVID grew more than 8% in the quarter, broadly exceeding our long-term revenue growth target of 5% to 7%. It is also important to note that our base business strength occurred in a quarter that started with the Delta wave and ended with COVID cases surging due to Omicron. Total revenues for the quarter of 1.47 billion showcased strength in every business and was significantly ahead of our previous guidance. EPS of $2.17 in the first quarter, far surpassed our initial guidance range of $1.15 to $1.25. We also continued to generate healthy free cash flow, funding our capital deployment priorities of tuck in M&A and share repurchases. We believe our balance sheet is a significant advantage in times of market uncertainty, which I'll touch on shortly. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. Like clarity on our performance, I will exclude the impact of COVID-19 where applicable. In diagnostics, global revenue of $950.4 million declined 15.2% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID assay sales related ancillary items in a small level of discontinued products, worldwide diagnostics revenue increased just over 10%. To better understand the underlying performance of our non-COVID molecular business, I will again exclude COVID-19 benefits. By doing this base molecular revenue grew about 14% organically in the first quarter. The growth was run by strong execution across our global portfolio as our largest non-COVID assay. chlamydia, gonorrhea was above pre-pandemic levels. Our newer vaginitis panel contributed well ahead of last year's run rate. And internationally, we continued to see strong demand for our Panther instrumentation, Our perspective, our annual molecular business excluding COVID, is now more than $100 million larger than before the pandemic. As it relates to our COVID-19 results, we continue to forecast conservatively, but act aggressively behind the scenes to meet demand for our customers. In the quarter, we generated $523 million of COVID assay revenue and shipped about 26 million tests to our customers. The United States represented about 60% of total COVID assay revenue, although demand was high around the world. Rounding out diagnostics, cytology and perinatal grew 5% compared to the prior year, a nice result that was also above 2019 levels. In breast health, global revenue of $359.3 million grew more than 8%. This growth was driven by our interventional business. As Steve highlighted which was up nearly 20% in the quarter. Breast imaging and service also increased mid-single digits in the period, underscoring resilience in the face of COVID headwinds. Our strategy to diversify and increase recurring revenue continues to pay off. In surgical, first quarter revenue of 134.3 million grew 8%. This solid performance was driven by a nice rebound in NovaSure from the launch of our next generation B5 system as well as momentum from new products such as Fluent and Acessa. While our surgical business was impacted by pullbacks in elective procedures, the impact was minimal in the quarter. We continued to stay close to our customers monitoring the Omicron surge in related staffing issues, which we do expect to be a headwind in Q2. Lastly, our skeletal business had revenue of $27.1 million increased 10% compared to the prior year period. Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the first quarter. Gross margin of 72.1% significantly beat our forecast, driven by higher than expected COVID-19 test volumes in the period. Total operating expenses of 333.9 million increased 22% in the first quarter, but we're down 5% sequentially compared to Q4. We continue to reinvest for future growth with incremental spending and R&D and marketing, pulling forward initiatives given the benefit from COVID-19. Further within our operating expenses, the inclusion of recent acquisitions accounted for a spend of approximately $30 million in Q1. And we also made additional charitable donations in the quarter. Finally, our non-GAAP tax rate in Q1 is 21.5% as expected. Putting these pieces together operating margin came in well above our forecast at 49.4% and net margin was a very strong 37.7%. Non-GAAP net income finished at 554.7 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.17, nearly 75% above the top end of our prior guidance. Moving on cash flow from operations was $564 million in the first quarter, a very strong result, which was more than 100% of non-GAAP net income. These robust cash flows continue to give us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, in the quarter we repurchased 2.3 million shares of our stock for $167 million and closed the acquisition of Bolder Surgical for $160 million. We continued to evaluate M&A that strategically fits well within our existing sales channels, or the narrow adjacency. Based on our strong operational performance, we had 1.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter. And our leverage ratio was 0.6x. Our capital structure is as strong as it has ever been. And we intend to deploy our excess cash on division led acquisitions, as well as share repurchases that improved our top and bottom-line growth rates. For example, we have been buying shares under our 10b5-1 plan within our second fiscal quarter to take advantages of market volatility. Finally, ROIC was 29.4% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 270 basis points compared to the prior year. Before we discuss our increased guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2022, I want to mention a few key points. Although the pandemic remains highly uncertain, we believe we are well positioned either way it may turn. To there be future outbreaks, we will meet our customers need and generate additional COVID testing revenue. Or should the pandemic subside, we expect strong performance in our base businesses. We believe we are nicely hedged against macro and market volatility. As it relates to supply chain headwinds, these challenges have become more specific in recent weeks. Due to the lack of available chips, we expect a temporary shortage of supply that will lengthen delivery timelines for mammography capital in our breast health division. While we hope to mitigate these effects, for conservatism we are estimating around $200 million of revenue will be pushed out of fiscal 2022. This includes up to $50 million headwind in our second quarter, as we are proactively beginning to extend lead times of new units to preserve inventory and maintain service continuity for gantries already in the field. This headwind is purely a supply issue and not one of underlying demand which remain strong. Despite the supply shortage, we are significantly increasing our full year revenue outlook underscoring the evolution of our diversified business model. We expect our diagnostics and surgical businesses along with COVID contributions to more than offset mammography headwinds. Now, let me move on to our specific guidance. In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect very strong financial results again, with total revenue in the range of 1.25 billion to 1.3 billion. As a reminder, our Q2 revenue is usually seasonally lower than Q1. For all of fiscal 2022, we expect total revenue in the range of 4.4 billion to 4.55 billion, significantly exceeding our prior full year guidance by $600 million at the midpoint. Given the recent strength of the U.S. dollar into aid with constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $23 million in the second quarter of 2022 and $56 million for the full year. In diagnostics and molecular continues to be the growth engine based on our larger Panther installed base of over 3000 instruments globally. Further, we are seeing encouraging uptake of new assays like our Vaginitis panel, as well as tremendous international expansion opportunities and a rebound in our core STI assays. As a result for fiscal 2022, we expect our base diagnostics franchise inclusive of cytology and perinatal to grow high single digits. In breast health, our organic and inorganic investments continued to perform well. For example, Brevera is off to a great start in 2022, growing in the high teens for the quarter. Further, recurring service revenue represents approximately 40% of total sales in Q1. Finally, in surgical we expect MyoSure to continue to drive growth, with help from better NovaSure performance. In addition, we expect new products and the recent acquisitions of Acessa and Bolder to add momentum to an already fast growing franchise. Like base diagnostics, we expect surgical to grow above our long-term organic guidance for fiscal 2022. In terms of COVID assay sales, the only certainty is that no one really knows how demand will progress for the rest of the year. Therefore, as we have done for the past several quarters, we are forecasting conservatively and will act aggressively. With that in mind, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $400 million in the second quarter of 2022. And at least $1 billion for the full year. COVID-related items, including revenue from discontinued products and diagnostics, are expected to be approximately $50 million in the second quarter and $190 million for the full year. As a reminder, our organic guidance backs out of revenue from acquisitions until the first full quarter after the deals annualize as well as revenue from our divested blood screening business. We expect blood screening revenue of $5 million to $6 million in Q2, and $20 million to $25 million for the full year. In total, we are backing out roughly $110 million of inorganic revenues for the year. To appreciate the underlying growth of our business, it is important to back out of organic revenue COVID assay sales, related ancillary items and a small amount of discontinued product revenue and diagnostics. On this measure and excluding the previously mentioned supply chain headwinds in breast health, we expect the rest of Hologic to grow at least at the high-end of our 5% to 7% long-term guidance. Moving down the P&L, for the full year we forecast our gross margin percentages in the mid 60s and our operating margin percentage to be in the mid to high 30s. Both estimates are higher than our guidance last quarter. We expect both percentages to decline sequentially throughout the year, consistent with our conservative planning that most COVID demand will occur in the first half. In addition, we have incorporated additional inflationary supply chain costs into our guidance as it relates to electronics, plastics and logistics. Despite this, for the full year, both gross and operating margin should be well above pre-pandemic levels. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be up compared to 2021, but declined sequentially in the back half of the year. As we've continued to highlight in quarters with higher COVID testing revenue, we will take the opportunity to invest more for future growth. Below operating income, we expect other expenses net to be a little less than $25 million a quarter for the remainder of the year. Our guidance is based on an effective tax rate of 21.5% and diluted shares outstanding of around 256 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected EPS of $1.50 to $1.60 in the second quarter well above current consensus estimates and $4.90 to $5.20 for the full year, 36% above our prior guidance at the midpoint. As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic and related supply chain challenge is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. Let me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted very strong first quarter results that far exceeded expectations and guidance. We are also significantly raising our financial guidance for the year, highlighting the multiple growth drivers we have added to each of our franchises in the upside to our business from capturing demand for COVID testing. With organic investments, multiple acquisitions and additional financial flexibility for capital deployment, we are a much stronger company than two years ago, and well positioned to prosper in the face of various uncertainties. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take the first question from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Dan Leonard : My first question on capital deployment. Could you elaborate or offer a bit more color on how aggressive you plan to be on the capital deployment front as cash builds on the balance sheet? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I think what we've talked about is, managing our free cash flow that we want to fully deploy our annual free cash flow between tuck in M&A and share repurchase. But having said that, Dan, we obviously will continue to be disciplined as it relates to tuck in M&A that would be the priority. So we might let some cash build on the balance sheet while again, disciplined and looking for the right deal. Dan Leonard : And then, an unrelated follow up, have your views on endemic COVID testing needs evolved at all? Stephen Macmillan : We believe COVID will be endemic. And we believe there will be ongoing molecular testing and probably feel even stronger about it than ever. Right? If you go back two years ago, none of us would have imagined we'd be having the amount of testing going on now. And at the end of the day, I think most governments and most people around the world have realized while there's antigen testing out there for true population health and frankly, to truly capture what's going on molecular is the answer. And I think we feel better and better. That's going to be an ongoing part of our business for many, many years. It's a virus, it mutates. And Omicron is not the last mutation of this thing. And I think we feel that we're well poised. Operator : We'll take the next question from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Just one on the supply chain that you brought up, Steve. What I guess is this on the breast health segment or which segment is this impacting? I'm curious what, we've been hearing this from other companies. I feel like when we had the guidance three months ago, right, things weren't as bad and now the things changed in the last three months. And what's been the base guidance reduction because of the supply chain impact, because I do feel like other parts of the base business are coming in better. So maybe if you could just talk about if the gross impact from supply chain was 200 million of revenue push out? How much of that was offset by better base performance? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. Certainly, some of it is, as we've highlighted with both surgical and diagnostics-based businesses, strengthening. Just as we've forecasted, COVID, conservatively, we want to put that out there. You don't have to anybody that's looked around at supply chain issues, the semiconductor and chip issues have not gotten better. And we're not totally sure exactly when that will fully work its way out. We're lengthening lead times, for our deliveries, and it's all in the breast health primarily in the gantry business. And we've got obviously maintained some chips for service. So, we're being conservative and taking care of our existing customers. And we'll lengthen and, frankly, it'll make next year probably look better. And it's great, we can absorb this, what I call annoyance right now, when the rest of the businesses are firing. Karleen Oberton : Yes. I would just build on that, Vijay is that, I think what we have here in Q2 is, we have inventory to cover that 50 million of revenue shortfall. But we're actively allocating to Steve's point to service because that's the most important thing is that we've got Inventory to keep that installed base up and running so that women can get back to screening. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And then maybe one follow-up, I think the prior guidance had 150 million contribution from M&A, did that change Karlene and Steve, I think you mentioned something about 90% of U.S. Panther customers, are they using an additional assay. Maybe talk about what kind of assays are they using? Are these CTGC high volume? What kind of revenue pull through can we expect in a post pandemic given the higher install base? Karleen Oberton : Yes, yes. So I think on the total revenue from acquisitions in 2022, is roughly 170 million. And then we talked about the inorganic piece that we're pulling out $110 million. And I think you went to another question there on the assays, I think, certainly, the STI assays are our biggest asset. So I would say that a lot of customers, that would be primarily what they're running. Operator : And we'll now take the next question from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Wanted to maybe continue on that path. Steve, your comment around the vaginitis panel feel like it's a pretty big statement to say, you think it could become your most successful launch outside of COVID? If memory serves me, right, I'm pretty sure chlamydia, gonorrhea is over $300 million business for you. So maybe just talk about the adoption you're seeing, like, what you think the ramp looks like for revenue? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think clearly, it's taken us a long time to get chlamydia, gonorrhea up into that into that multi 100 million range. But I think we feel really, this is going to be over years. But I think we're feeling pretty good about that ramp, you figure if we just did 13 million in the first quarter, multiply that by four and you've got the very bare minimum of, I think what we expect to do this year. So they'll probably continue to build through the quarters. And I think if we fast forward a few years from now, certainly goes north of 100 now its way to 200. Karleen Oberton : Yes. And I think, again, when we talk about the launch, I think for comparison, Jack and think about the [trick] [ph] assay took about five to six years to get to that 70 million, and we're getting close to that here, only a couple years out. So that's kind of the success of the launch that I want to highlight. Stephen MacMillan : It's a very meaningful indication, it's been completely under diagnosed and I think it's part of the rapid uptake. And it's really a great reason to go to the doctor. Jack Meehan : Great. And then, also wanted to follow up just on the supply chain point. I'm looking at the -- in my model, the breast imaging product sales didn't look like you really had much of an impact in the fiscal first quarter. So is this something that really is just kind of picking up in the last few weeks, and 200 million in context seems pretty significant in light of that line item, so maybe just help put a little bit more color around that would be helpful. Stephen MacMillan : Yes, it clearly has emerged here, we kept hoping we would find solutions. I've watched our operations team over the last couple of years. They've just been a Herculean first on MTUs and Tecan tips, swabs on, glass tubes on everything, we did the scale during COVID time to getting more Panthers out the door. And we were hearing a lot of the issues from our chip suppliers, but kept thinking we would find some alternatives and some solutions, and really is it's come down. At the end of the day, as you can see where we were able to call it manufacture additional plastic or find other things. In the COVID piece, we haven't been able to manufacture semiconductor chips and we're at the beck and call of the global supply chain here, where everybody's been tugging on it.  So as we've gotten into -- so yes, clearly, it didn't impact last quarter at all, it\u2019s technically not even hurting us in the very moment right now but it's as we go forth. And then, there's two pieces of right, one is, we could sell a lot more of the chips that we will have on allocation into new gantries. So we want to make sure that we keep every gantry that's out there up and running. So we're keeping a good chunk of the chips that will be coming for ongoing service. And if we were just trying to maximize short-term revenue, the hit wouldn't be nearly as big, but we want to make sure we're taking care of the service side. So definitely an annoyance, it's one and to your point, it's a fairly big number that we want to call out right now, in the midst of an overall thing. I think it does underscore how far we've come as a company, right? You think about that kind of a hit eight years ago would have been a big deal, even three or four years ago would have been a very sizable knockdown punch. And now it's kind of annoying little body blow that we know will work right through and set ourselves up to continue to win. Operator : We\u2019ll now take the next question from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, thanks for taking the questions, guys. Steve, you touched a little bit on kind of the Panther outlook beyond COVID. Certainly the question we get most as well, kind of stretching beyond that is utilization is going to be the right number to look at anymore beyond this. How are you framing the right way to look at this business beyond COVID? Because, again, obviously, the installed base is far bigger. I think everyone tries to put a utilization number on it, how do you frame that view, kind of setting it up and looking at that business beyond COVID, or at least when COVID is endemic that's why? Stephen MacMillan : Why we kind of think about in a real simplistic term Patrick, which is our total revenue that comes from it. And so, to that point, right, we're going to have over 3000 Panthers, clearly, the pure dollar volume will likely come down from what it was pre pandemic on a global basis, in the near term, because we've placed a whole bunch more internationally where we don't have quite as much revenue for Panther. And we've also gone to some smaller customers, where it will clearly pay off over time. So the way we think about it, I mean, ultimately comes down to number of Panthers, times the amount of revenue generated per Panther. And we see enormous upside to where that's going to go here over time. So many of the folks that have brought bought Panthers in the last year plus, or where we've installed Panthers, they keep wanting, they keep getting ready to put the regular assays on. And then, COVID spikes yet again, and so it's still out there. So we have so much pent-up volume, all those [torques] [ph] that were generated largely in 2020, 2021, are all still delayed, and it comes down to we just generated 14% growth in this quarter, even while COVID was surging. So I think it's hard to exactly model it, per se, but it's just going to come down to we're going to be selling a lot more assays on a lot more machines. And that's going to generate clearly accretive growth rates above the company average for a long time. Karleen Oberton : And just to add maybe a finer point to that even versus Q1 \u201819. That's basically like your business is up over 40% I mean, that's a tremendous growth over the past couple years. Patrick Donnelly : Sure. That's helpful, hard number to peck down for sure on the [go] [ph] through. Karleen, maybe one for you just on the margin setup. Obviously, you talked a bit about the supply chain stuff, I imagine that you're adding to some of the inflationary pressures. Can you just talk through kind of that core margin as we as we try to back COVID out a bit? How that sets up for the rest of the year? And again, any impact from some of the supply chain noise you're seeing there on breast? Karleen Oberton : Yes, certainly. Yes, the supply chain is both the revenue on breast and some of the higher cost as well, though, that we mentioned. I think absent of the revenue headwind, certainly that base business operating margins, if we had minimal COVID are still in that low 30%, that we were prior to the pandemic. So we continue to keep an eye on that. And I think, again, some of the strengths that we talked about are continue to contribute to that base business is still healthy on the operating margin line. Operator : We'll now take the next question from the line of Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Tejas Savant : Just sort of following up on Patrick's second question there. Karleen, can you just give us your updated views on what is a good sort of blended ASP to use, given the U.S. versus OUS mix in the COVID testing side? And to what degree do you expect some of the investments you've made in commercial capabilities and operating leverage as well, to cushion the COVID testing margin over time as the mix evolves? Karleen Oberton : Yes, from an ASP perspective, certainly, pricing has held pretty nicely here, I think, roughly $20, with the overall average in the quarter, I think as we look forward, we do expect that pricing will come down, one as we renew international contracts, which are lower ASP, as well as in the U.S., when the higher -- when the public health emergency ends in this higher lower payment for the testing will probably come down. But still, we have a way to go on that pricing to come down to still have that revenue be accretive to the overall corporate average. And think about the overall business and margins, certainly our supply chain, folks, you annually have improvement targets that they go after that some of them even in this year of buffering some of the higher costs that we're seeing. We have network optimization opportunities that we're focused on. And certainly we've talked about investing internationally, intentionally, over the past several years, that we believe that international revenue continues to grow, we'll have more margin accretion from the international business. Tejas Savant : Got it. And one for you, Steve, on the launch of the Panther tracks here in December. Can you sort of quantify the cost savings that some of your high throughput customers could see from the added automation here? And overtime do you expect us to drive an uptick in Panther sales in new accounts? Or is this more of a convenience for your current high throughput customers given some of the labor issues everybody's seeing at the moment? KarleenOberton: Yes, absolutely. We do think this would be a labor efficiency for our labs. This is something that there's a really long lead time to the track system, so 18 to 24 months. So we won't have any kind of data on actual cost savings for a couple of years. But this is something that we actually have partnered with our customers on, on the development of how it will work in the lab. And we're excited to officially launch it here. Operator : We will now take the next questions from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian Weinstein : So I guess let's talk a little bit about geographic performance. Did you continue to lean into that, and maybe you can be a little bit more specific about territories and products and kind of run through where you're seeing the strings? I recognize it's kind of across the board. But if there's anything that you would kind of call out there? And then, what maybe I missed a bit. Can you talk also about what the U.S. growth rate was? And I'll have a follow up after that. Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Yes, I think, overall, international, obviously, we said is a double-digit grower. And I think, we'd said years ago, we expected that international would become probably a double-digit grower for many, many years. And I think we're exactly into that. A lot of it candidly, Brian is really coming out of Western Europe, because that's where our biggest footprint is. And it's where we've placed a ton of the Panthers. We're starting to get certainly more of it out of out of Asia Pac as well. But the bigger chunk is really Western Europe, a little bit of Africa and I think continue to feel good. And overall, that the international growth rate is above the U.S rate. Brian Weinstein : Yes. Is there anything on kind of a product side? I mean, obviously diagnostics is, I'm guessing, driving that, but are any of the other kinds of businesses seeing significant acceleration OUS? That you'd want to call out there? Stephen MacMillan : I think the magic is, it's actually largely across the board. Even our psychology business is actually doing well, particularly in a few key markets in Western Europe, the overall diagnostics as we've been placing those Panthers, I think you can go back really over three, four -- three or four years now, where the molecular business outside the U.S. is oftentimes been at 20-ish percent growth rate, and if anything, it's just going to be turbocharged here. Going forward, breast health has been very solid as well and even things like the SOMATEX acquisition we did in breast health, 15 months ago, whatever, a German-based company with some of the markers, it's helped put us on the on the map there. Surgicals picking up a little bit. So, there's no one -- I think the magic of it that makes us feel actually even better is, it's not like a one hit wonder. It's not one country, one geography, one product line, even one franchise is doing it. It's really a whole bunch of incremental things, just inexorably getting stronger. And then, that's what gives us more confidence for the future. Operator : We will now take the next question from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Casey Woodring : This is Casey on for Tycho. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is on breast health. So how should we think about breast health margins given the shift towards recurring revenue now, the 23% of the business is gantries? How's that margin profile change alongside this mixed shift? And I guess in the near term, what sort of impact to margins is embedded in the 2022 numbers with lower gantry sales? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So I think on the breast health business, if we think about operating margins, certainly the service business is accretive to the operating margins, which is the biggest part of revenue for that division, Then I would say, then there's probably equal contribution from gantries and interventional from an operating module perspective. Certainly, the headwind, the $200 million headwind is significant to that division. But, fortunately here, we were able to raise our full year guidance based on the performance of the rest of the business and the COVID contributions. So we can well manage this headwind and not have to do things like -- manage headcount or the other things. So preserve our great salesforce that we have our service engineers and still feel good about managing through this headwind. Casey Woodring : Got it. That's helpful. I was wondering if you can give us some updated test of record metrics in the molecular side. How did those trends in the last few quarters and how much of this x-COVID growth is coming from existing customers that are just reporting more of them menu over to Panther versus new customers? Thank you. Karleen Oberton : Yes. Casey, we think of the test record as an annual number. So to put it in perspective, prior to the pandemic, our largest year was 20 million, we did about 34 million in 2020, and about 40 million in 2021. And we expect that 2022 will be another number in that $30 million to $40 million range. Operator : We'll now take the next question from Derik De Bruin with BofA. Derik De Bruin : So actually, I just wanted to follow up on that last question. And just, look, you're placing enormously impressive number of Panthers at 100, this quarter, that was certainly more than I thought you would have. Just a little bit color on where your installs are, add-on servicing customers, greenfields, competitive replacements. And I guess where is, if you go back and look pre-pandemic and you look at the number of labs that were not doing molecular diagnostics, how is that sort of like overall -- in step of that overall market expanded, just try to get some script, this idea and just the continued pace of Panther placements in the market opportunity. Stephen MacMillan : In terms of where they're going Derek. It's really again, it's very broad based, some are to existing customers and some might have three and they add a fourth. We've definitely got new customers as well, they're going into -- the hospitals are going into small labs, they're going into the big labs, they're going into some -- certainly some are new customers for us. And, therefore, whether it's a competitive win or just an expansion of that, labs business, we're certainly seeing that. And we do think, the overall focus on high throughput instruments is going to be a very good thing for us going forth. And we feel like that's where we've got a real winning edge, as you you've known Panther well. Derik De Bruin : Great. And then just one other question. As you're sort of like, the geographic mix shifts, how should we sort of think about the tax rate on the out years is there sort of [indiscernible], or it's still up in the air because of all the potential changes in tax laws that are being contemplated? Thank you. Karleen Oberton : Yes. Certainly hard to comment on the future tax rate when there's no real legislation really in place. And, as you know, the devils in the details on something like that. But certainly if the federal headline rate went up, our overall non-GAAP tax rate would go up. But I would tell you that, we certainly have an active tax department that is partnering with our operations team to put in efficiency strategies. Operator : We'll now take the next question from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : Karleen, just on the COVID guidance, if I think back to your four number, originally, I think was around 200 million. We kind of assumed about 50 million a quarter. And now you guys are at a billion you did 500 and change this quarter? The pacing of that number, is it fair to assume, given the line and say you have that 300 million to 400 million can be done in this upcoming quarter? And we should think 50 and 50 in the back half of the year? Or are you thinking about the pace into those COVID sales a little differently than what I laid out? Karleen Oberton : Yes, Ryan. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we are assuming about a minimum of 400 million here in the second quarter. So that would lead to your mass of roughly 50 and 50 in the Q3 and Q4. Ryan Zimmerman : Okay. I must have missed that. [Indiscernible]. And then, Steve, just on breast, you guys have moved downstream. And you're in much more surgery now than you were before. Obviously, mammography was kind of your beachhead when you think about the surgical options. And where you could go beyond your existing procedure categories. Is there room to go deeper? Is there room to go broader in surgery and breast? Curious kind of how you think about how rounded of a portfolio you have today, relative to where you want to take that? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. We're looking both ways actually, as we think about it, whether we -- obviously, we've done smaller build-ons in terms of the markers and Faxitron Focal, kind of the breast conserving surgery stuff. I think we see various different ways we can go and are really assessing what else we can be doing across the broad continuum of care. And particularly on the treatment side of breast, so more of that would be potential in organic, some of its organic and we continue to look at things that way. We have time for one more question. Operator : We'll take the next question from line of Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Puneet Souda : So maybe just one for me, obviously, great cash flow position that you have and existing cash position as well. So just, a frequent question in these times happens to be around valuation. And what appears to be somewhat of a disconnect between sort of the buyers and the sellers, given the sudden pullback in the public markets. So it seems like expectations have been normalized, so to speak in the public markets, but wondering if you're seeing anything different in the private market? Or if you're seeing just overall broadly, this disconnect to sort of normalize and how do you look at the -- sort of the current timing and evaluations out there? Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. It's great question. Certainly when valuation is correct, you always have the sellers, kind of remembering the good old days that might have been and I think right now we feel we're in a great position. There's a lot of stuff that, we had every banker and we had a bunch of both privates and companies went public last year in our face that wanted us to buy them then. And we said to a lot of them, why don't you go ahead and go public? And we'll keep our eyes on you and look at you later. So I think a lot of the corrections may create opportunities for us at the right time, they've got to settle in themselves. And candidly, when you have a really successful business, which we have right now, there's no urgency. So I think we were in that magical spot where our core businesses are so strong and growing, that we don't need to do anything. Meanwhile, we keep racking up cash, that puts us in a great position when we do want to act. And, we think whether it's this year or whether it's next year, opportunities will present themselves that we'll be able to take advantage of but absolutely no urgency from our standpoint, while people readjust to what might be that the true realities, not what they want to believe the realities could be Operator : And that's all the time we have for questions.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to the Hologic 2Q \u201822 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lauren and I am your operator for today\u2019s call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations to begin the call. Ryan Simon : Thank you, Lauren. Good afternoon and thank you for joining Hologic\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website, along with an updated corporate presentation. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we delivered them. And a replay of this call will be available through May 27. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are : one, organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue, excluding the divested blood screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and discontinued product sales in Diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic\u2019s CEO. Steve MacMillan : Thank you, Ryan and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We posted solid results overall and continued our excellent performance. Total revenue was $1.44 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.07, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by over 12% on the top line and over 33% on the bottom. As we stated last quarter, we continued to deliver in an uncertain business environment. For example, in January, we saw COVID cases spike once again, putting pressure on healthcare utilization and certain elective procedures. Through February and March, the ripple effects of the war in Ukraine added additional uncertainty to a world already facing headwinds from COVID, rising inflation and interest rates as well as ongoing global supply chain disruptions. In these challenging times, we continue to deliver. Our performance is a direct result of the planning and investments we made throughout the pandemic to strategically strengthen our business. We are a stronger Hologic through portfolio diversification, the addition of multiple growth drivers into our franchises and continued growth in our international businesses. Today, we would like to provide additional color in three areas. First, we will discuss Q2 growth in light of the macro environment, including updates on the breast health chip shortage we spoke to in Q1; second, provide progress on acquisitions turning organic in our third quarter; and third, highlight our additional efforts to lean into ESG and how our purpose, passion and promise are elevating women\u2019s health around the world. In our second quarter, both our diagnostics and surgical divisions delivered organic growth, excluding COVID, while as expected, our breast and skeletal health division declined. In breast, as we discussed in our last call, the semiconductor chip shortage was the primary driver of the division\u2019s temporary decline. Encouragingly, underlying demand remains strong as measured by healthy orders and a growing backlog. As we have seen during the last 2 years, as COVID testing rises, elective annual exams, screenings and GYN surgical procedures are often postponed. And as COVID testing declines, we see the opposite and our base business returns. We believe what the latest rebound also makes clear is that demand for our products remains strong despite the unpredictability of COVID surges. We are confident in our business, confident in our people, and excited about our positioning heading into the third quarter. For example, in Diagnostics, we placed an additional 123 Panthers in the second quarter, surpassing first quarter placements of 119. Only halfway through the year, we have again exceeded our pre-pandemic average of roughly 225 Panther placements per year. This is a phenomenal result given the rapid global expansion of our Panther installed base during the pandemic. Our Panther installed base is now over 3,100 instruments worldwide with over 45% placed internationally. Also in Diagnostics, our vaginitis panel, BV CV/TV continues its growth trajectory. In our Q2 of 2021, this assay generated about $7 million for the quarter. 1 year later, the panel contributed almost $14 million in worldwide sales, nearly double the year before. And BV CV/TV is now on pace to become a top three women\u2019s health assay in our molecular diagnostics portfolio. Now, let\u2019s provide an update on chip supply and Breast Health. Our supply chain service and commercial organizations have been working hard to gain greater visibility and mitigate the impact of the shortage. In Q2, the impact is slightly less than estimated driven by favorable availability and precise management of chips and circulation within our service inventory. While our teams continue to do a great job navigating the unpredictable supply challenges on chips, the ongoing volatility of supply makes it possible that up to $50 million an additional headwind could surface in the back half of the year. Despite this, we are still materially increasing guidance for the full company, which Karleen will speak to later on. To finish the chip discussion on an upbeat note, we recently received notice of an increased allocation of chips for late in fiscal 2022. While this is very encouraging, given production and delivery timing, the benefit from this increase is unlikely to help revenue until early 2023. Said another way, we are optimistic the back half of our fiscal \u201822 will prove to be the low watermark in terms of available gantries. Moving on to an update on acquisitions, turning organic. In our fiscal third quarter, contributions from both Biotheranostics and Diagenode will be included in the organic growth of our Diagnostics division. We will provide an update on both today. First, Biotheranostics. As a reminder, we completed this acquisition in February of 2021. The goal of this acquisition was to enter the high growth lab-based oncology market, an adjacent longtime area of interest and bring our resources and expertise to create an even stronger business. Based on Breast Cancer Index\u2019s earlier than anticipated inclusion in NCCN guidelines in January of 2021, the deal is off to a great start. Last year in its first full quarter post-acquisition, Biotheranostics posted $13 million of revenue, which was more than 30% higher than their best quarter prior to the pandemic. Fast-forward to our most recent quarter, Biotheranostics generated $16.4 million in revenue. This early success comes as a result of outstanding engagement in a successful cross-functional cross-enterprise integration. As planned, we deployed Hologic resources and expertise and paired this with legacy Biotheranostics capabilities, to refine operational efficiency, and most importantly, set a solid foundation for scalable growth. To accelerate Biotheranostics already strong growth, as an example, we are streamlining the businesses ordering process, which we believe will simplify things for the customer. We expect this enhancement will greatly improve the customer experience and ultimately result in more orders. We are also excited to share that we are in the process of transferring Biotheranostics operations to our diagnostics headquarters in San Diego. While maintaining required division between CLIA and IVD activities, we believe the move will lead to an even more unified culture, stronger relationships between counterparts and more collaborative efforts. Finally and even more encouraging, just last week, the Biotheranostics BCI test was included in the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, another major step towards increasing utilization and recognition of BCI as the standard of care. BCI is now the only genomic test in both NCCN and ASCO guidelines, for predicting benefit of extended endocrine therapy. Moving on. Shortly after we closed the Biotheranostics transaction, we acquired Diagenode based in Belgium. The goal of the acquisition was to accelerate PCR-based assay development for our Panther Fusion and leverage additional R&D capabilities in Europe. So far, we have checked both boxes. Since the close of the acquisition, as planned, we have integrated the Diagenode organization to optimize the speed and efficiency of our global R&D organization, enabling more effective and more efficient cross-border innovation. To-date, teams from San Diego and Belgium have worked together closely to improve processes and clearly define a robust product development pipeline. The team is already making meaningful progress towards approval of two viral load assays, which will expand our urology portfolio in the transplant testing space. Overall, for both Biotheranostics and Diagenode, we are pleased with the integration and progress of these two businesses. As we look forward, we are excited by the opportunity to unlock more synergies from both and in turn, create more value for our shareholders. Shifting gears, I\u2019d like to close by highlighting two very meaningful and opportunistic marketing efforts from our second quarter. The first being our Super Bowl commercial, which also ran during the Winter Olympics and the second, our title sponsorship of the Women\u2019s Tennis Association Tour. As many of you may have seen, our television commercial titled, Her Health is Her Wealth, featured Mary J. Blige. The commercial highlighted that despite her busy life, she makes time in her schedule for her annual health exams. The campaign came at a critical time as an alarming number of women, missed annual breast and cervical cancer screenings during the COVID-19 pandemic. In January, the inaugural results of our Hologic Global Women\u2019s Health Index found that nearly 50% of women ages 16 to 54 had not seen a medical professional in the prior year. The purpose of our message was to encourage women to schedule their annual exams and prioritize their health. Detecting cancer early is critical and can often make the difference between a curable and non-curable prognosis. After 2 years of the pandemic, with too many women not being screened and our unique relationship with Mary J. Blige, there was no better time and no better stage for us to encourage more women to see their doctors. Our second effort is our landmark title sponsorship of the WTA Tour announced in early March. This alliance was forced to make significant progress on our shared vision of greater wellness and equality for women. The partnership has global reach and will emphasize the importance of preventive care through well-woman visits. We are proud to stand with the WTA as we work together to jointly raise the profile of women and share the importance of early detection and treatment. Before turning the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that the results of this quarter demonstrate our business is both durable and resilient and the demand for our products is exceptionally strong. Despite multiple macro headwinds, we continue to deliver strong results. We are both excited and confident in our business and see great opportunity to be even stronger in the years ahead. With that, let me turn the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve and good afternoon everyone. We are very pleased to share second quarter results that significantly exceeded our guidance for both revenue and EPS. Our second quarter performance once again highlights the strength of our diverse business. While the Omicron variant negatively impacted our base businesses early in the quarter, our COVID testing upside more than offset this headwind. It\u2019s also important to understand that our balance sheet is stronger than ever, providing key strategic flexibility in this uncertain macro environment. Further, we continue to generate very healthy free cash flow, funding our capital deployment priorities. In the second quarter, we generated significant operating cash flow and executed $200 million of share repurchase, both of which I will touch on in more detail shortly. Before we do that, we will provide color on our consolidated and divisional results for the second quarter. As a reminder, revenue in our fiscal second quarter is typically seasonally lower compared to our first quarter, which benefits from increased patient activity before calendar year end. In the quarter, total revenue of over $1.4 billion was very strong and came in more than $150 million higher than the midpoint of our previous guidance. In addition, EPS of $2.07 in the second quarter far exceeded our guidance range of $1.50 to $1.60. Turning to our divisional results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $987.1 million declined 5.6% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID, worldwide organic diagnostics revenue increased 4%. As discussed, the division\u2019s results early in Q2 were negatively impacted by the Omicron COVID-19 variant. Our base diagnostics business is inversely correlated to spikes in the pandemic as women tend to postpone office visits when COVID cases surge. However, we were encouraged by improving trends throughout March as COVID cases declined. This gives us great confidence in the underlying health of our base diagnostics franchise. Moving specifically to our molecular diagnostics business, we will again exclude the impact of COVID. Making these adjustments, base molecular revenue grew about 7% organically in the second quarter. This growth was driven by strong uptake in newer assays such as our vaginitis panel and menu within our virology product line. As it relates to our COVID results, we generated $584 million of COVID assay revenue, far exceeding our guidance of $400 million. We shipped about 28.5 million tests to customers as ASPs held steady around $20 per test globally. The United States represented about 60% of total COVID assay revenue. However, testing demand was strong in international markets as well. Rounding out Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal businesses were essentially flat compared to the prior year as these segments were also impacted by COVID-19\u2019s influence on women\u2019s wellness visits. In Breast Health, global revenue of $310.4 million was down approximately 7% as expected, primarily driven by the chip shortages that we have discussed. In our interventional business, incremental supply chain pressure of a few million dollars surfaced during the quarter, specific to our disposable biopsy needles. As a result, our interventional business was down slightly less than 1% in the period. While supply chain challenges persist, demand for our best-in-class Breast Health products remain strong. And as Steve commented, we expect to see improvement in 2023. In Surgical, second quarter revenue of $117.3 million grew 3.5%. As we foreshadowed during our first quarter call, the Omicron variant caused a pullback in elective procedures in the first half of the quarter. But this trend improved later in the period as COVID cases declined. Furthermore, we saw a nice resilience from several of our newer products such as the Fluent fluid management system and solid contributions from Bolder\u2019s cool sale devices. Lastly, our skeletal business, revenue of $20.9 million decreased 6% compared to the prior year period. Now let\u2019s move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin of 71% was well ahead of our forecast, driven by higher-than-expected COVID-19 testing volumes in the period. Total operating expenses of $338.2 million increased 22% in the second quarter. As we have done throughout the pandemic, given the benefit from COVID-19 profitability, we took the opportunity to reinvest in our base businesses. We also allocated spend to key marketing initiatives to help drive awareness for women\u2019s health. For example, second quarter operating expenses included our Super Bowl and Olympic commercials as well as expenses associated with our WTA partnership. The combined total of these initiatives contribute slightly more than $25 million to operating expenses in the quarter. In addition, within operating expenses, recent acquisitions added slightly less than $35 million in the quarter, about $25 million higher than the prior year period. Finally, our tax rate in Q2 was 20.5%, marginally lower than our expectations given the higher COVID-19 revenue outside the United States. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q2 came in well above our forecast at 47.4% and net margin was very strong at 36.5%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $524.2 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.07, nearly 35% above the midpoint of our prior guidance. Moving on to the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $1.06 billion in the second quarter, inclusive of tax refunds totaling approximately $418 million related to the sale of our previously held Medical Aesthetics business in 2020. When normalizing for these refunds, cash generation for the quarter was still exceptional. These robust cash flows continue to provide tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, as referred to earlier, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our stock for $200 million in the quarter. We continue to view our ongoing share repurchase program as a lever to drive value for our shareholders. Further, we continue to diligently pursue M&A opportunities in each one of our divisions. Based on our strong operational performance, we had $2.3 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.3x. Our capital structure is fortified. And while we ended the quarter with an elevated cash balance, we continue to be thorough in exercise discipline as we evaluate opportunities. Given the macro environment, we have comfort with our elevated cash balance in the ability to be patient as we identify high-quality opportunities. Now let\u2019s move on to our updated guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2022. In the third quarter, we expect to continue our track record of delivering strong financial results with total revenue in the range of $875 million to $915 million. For the full year fiscal 2022, we expect total revenue in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion, significantly exceeding our prior full year guidance by $175 million at the midpoint. We are raising guidance once again in the face of an uncertain macro backdrop, highlighting our confidence in our business. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar and to aid with constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $20 million in the third quarter of 2022 and $65 million for the full year. This FX unfavorability to revenue is higher than our guidance from last quarter. In Diagnostics, we expect molecular to continue to drive growth based on our Panther installed base of over 3,100 instruments globally, over 80% larger than the start of the pandemic. We are also seeing encouraging uptake of our newer assays like our vaginitis panel, virals and Amgen as well as the tremendous international expansion opportunities. In terms of COVID sales, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $100 million in the third quarter of 2022 and approximately $1.25 billion for the full year. COVID related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be approximately $35 million in the third quarter and $215 million for the full year. In Breast Health, our organic and inorganic investments continue to perform well and highlight the diversity of the division\u2019s revenue streams. For example, Brevera had another great result, growing mid-teens in the last quarter. In addition, recurring service revenue represented more than 40% of total sales in Q2. In terms of the Breast Health chip shortage announced last quarter, given significant uncertainties still exist in the chip market the possibility of an incremental $50 million headwind in the back half of 2022 exists, and we have incorporated this into our guidance. While we are seeing early signs of improvement in chip supply, we are forecasting conservatively. To reemphasize this headwind is purely a supply issue and not one of underlying demand, which remains strong. Finally, in Surgical, we feel great about the trajectory of our business as COVID trends improve. MyoSure and related organic products such as Fluent continue to drive near-term growth and we expect meaningful contribution from both Acessa and Boulder over the next several years. As a reminder, our organic guidance backs out of revenue from acquisitions until the first full quarter after a deal annualizes as well as revenue from our divested blood screening business. In terms of the deal, Biotheranostics and Diagenode will become part of our organic revenue in Q3 \u201822. Therefore, the organic revenue adjustments for Q3 includes Mobidiag and Boulder and for Q4 Boulder only. Moving down the P&L. For the full year, we forecast our non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the mid- to high 60s and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be in the high 30s. Both estimates are higher than our guidance last quarter. Further, our second half guidance incorporates the margin impact from our Breast Health supply chain revenue shortfall. As a reminder, Gantry gross margin is accretive to the consolidated averages, and we have maintained operating spend in order to be in a position to move quickly once we receive chips. In addition, we have again incorporated inflationary supply chain costs into our guidance as it relates to electronics, plastics and logistics. Despite these headwinds, for the full year, we expect both gross and operating margins to be above pre-pandemic levels. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be up compared to 2021, but be lower in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half. As we have continued to highlight, in quarters with higher COVID testing revenue, we will take the opportunity to invest for future growth. Below operating income, we expect other expenses net to be a little less than $25 million a quarter for the remainder of the year. Our guidance is based on effective tax rate of 21% and diluted shares outstanding of around $255 million for the full year. All this net add to expected EPS of $0.67 to $0.72 in the third quarter and $5.45 to $5.65 for the full year, 10% above our prior guidance at the midpoint. As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic related supply chain challenges and geopolitical conflicts remain high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporates both potential upsides and downsides. Let me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted very strong second quarter results that far exceeded expectations and guidance. We are also raising our financial guidance for the year. Even as we are increasing anticipated supply chain headwinds, highlighting the multiple growth drivers we have added to each of our franchises and benefits from COVID testing. With a strong balance sheet and best-in-class cash flow generation, we are well positioned. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Thank you and good afternoon. Steve MacMillan : Hi, Jack. Jack Meehan : My first question is on Breast Health and the semiconductors. So last quarter, the \u2013 up to $200 million you talked about, I thought it was fully de-risking the gantry exposure. And then the quarter actually came in a little better than you were thinking. So I\u2019m just trying to square this commentary with the additional $50 million you\u2019re building in from here. Can you just maybe help me through that? And kind of second off that, just can you give us a little bit more color on the order book and just your confidence that you\u2019re not losing share given some of the supply chain shortages there? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So Jack, it\u2019s Karleen. I\u2019ll start off on kind of the evolution of the numbers. So first, let\u2019s recognize in this quarter, we did a little better, and that was really a lot of efforts between our service and supply chain folks really prioritizing in remanufacturing chips for the service needs, which allowed us to sell more new gantries. So great effort there. I think when we think about the additional possibility of an additional $50 million, it has a little more to do with timing. And so we are pleased that we got a higher allocation of chips than we had thought than we had originally expected, but the timing of that is such that it won\u2019t come in until 2023. I think we thought if there was an additional allocation, we might get that benefit in \u201822, but it\u2019s looking like it\u2019s 2023. And I think just on the second part of your question on demand, again, we see our backlog growing in our Breast Health business. It\u2019s strong. We\u2019re working really strategically with customers to make sure that we\u2019re not losing any business because of this. And I think our intelligence would be that our competitors are probably in likely the same position as us. Steve MacMillan : And I think the reps feel that. Jack Meehan : It is. Okay. Yes, that makes sense on the timing, very helpful. As an unrelated follow-up, obviously, in molecular, big focus on kind of share shifts in the diagnostics industry with COVID I was wondering if you could talk about your relationship with the National Labs and just with the larger customers, whether you think you\u2019re gaining or losing share as we transition eventually into an endemic environment? Steve MacMillan : Yes, Jack. And by the way, I\u2019d also clarify that we\u2019re not going to use the cash on the balance sheet to buy the Eagles. I know you, but\u2026 Jack Meehan : Hopefully, they make some good picks tomorrow. Steve MacMillan : Yes, exactly. So in terms of our relationship with the National Labs, I probably couldn\u2019t be more proud of our teams. And even we\u2019ve always had good relationships, but when you think about the way we responded. And particularly, if you look at the two big major labs in the United States, but even a number of the other big ones right below the top two. When they were really under the gun and you think back to the April, May, June time frame of 2020, when the evening news around the world \u2013 around the country was always about the 8-day turnaround times for PCR tests and all of the problems with molecular testing. And that\u2019s when we dispatched and our team went around the clock to put Panthers in all over the place. And we really worked so well to help those \u2013 both of those customers dramatically reduce the turnaround times. And I think we\u2019ve used both the relationship in coming to their aid during that time as well as, frankly, I think they increasingly understand that we\u2019re building markets. When it comes to how we approach the women\u2019s health market, we\u2019re also working the reimbursements. We\u2019re working the physician recommendations. We\u2019re working the guideline developments. And all of that is helping to grow the market, which, by definition, is growing them. So I would tell you, I feel like it\u2019s more of a partnership that is valued than just a traditional vendor/vendee relationship. And I think our teams have worked so hard to have many good relationships throughout all levels, both operationally within the marketing teams, and we like where we\u2019re positioned. We really do. Jack Meehan : Thank you, Steve. Steve MacMillan : Great. Thanks, Jack. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, maybe one big picture for you. I\u2019m looking at the base business here, the segments, it looks like was light across the board. Breast imaging, perhaps it\u2019s understandable given the chip shortage. It looks like underlying diagnostics came in below Street models. GYN, a similar trend. How much of this was a utilization impact due to Omicron? And the reason I asked is we\u2019re seeing other device companies coming up with improved procedure trends. I\u2019m curious, was there any one-off items that impacted the Hologic in the Q? Steve MacMillan : I think, Vijay, part of it on the Surgical business is probably as some of the hospitals came back up post Omicron. They tended to prioritize some of the cardiovascular procedures and some of the more immediate procedures, whereas our GYN surge is viewed as a little more elective. So I think there was a little bit of that probably in the quarter that we think shakes out completely over time as the women\u2019s health issues come back. And I think our base molecular diagnostics business was up 7%, not too shabby in a period where a lot of our machines ended up running a lot of additional COVID tests, so nothing that we are concerned about. And I think as we continue to look all of these quarters, there is variability in the puts and takes, and we keep managing our business overall that as one part goes up. The reality is we do see trade-offs we did sell $584 million of COVID in the quarter. There is a bit of a trade-off on our base business with that. So as that goes back, I think we\u2019re very optimistic about where the base business comes here as that COVID testing really does probably really some side here. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful perspective, Steve. And maybe one related. There is been a lot of debate on the Street on what is the underlying base margins, base earnings power for Hologic. Not what the Street is trying to do. We\u2019re trying to do a cohort P&L and a base business P&L. And in reality, that may not be have corporates think about their businesses. How much of reinvestment is going on in the business? Do you \u2013 and the reason I ask is, if I look at the implied Q4 EPS guide, I think it\u2019s $0.60, $0.65. So that\u2019s annualizing at $250 million, I\u2019m assuming Q4 has very minimal COVID testing, but also it has some impact from breast imaging, the chip shortage, right? So what is the underlying earnings power here for Hologic that we should be thinking about? Karleen Oberton : Yes. Vijay, it\u2019s Karleen. I\u2019ll take you through it. So if we look at the second half of 2022, you\u2019re right. That is the worst impact of the breast health chip shortage. And so don\u2019t think of the back half earnings power and the math you just did on the Q4 as what we call our base business earnings power. There is definitely an impact there, significant impact with pretty minimal COVID revenue in the fourth quarter. The other thing I would point to is that if we look at the back half, we have a higher operating expenses and simply dilutive operating margins from our acquisitions, which actually be a tailwind as we move forward into 2023 and beyond. And we do have some incremental investments in both Q3 and Q4. Those investments will either not occur in 2023 or be significantly lower. So to reiterate, the back half earnings power is not reflective of the base business because of the one-time items, I\u2019ll call them, that we have there. Steve MacMillan : And Vijay, back to even building on the comment on the base business, I\u2019d remind you in a couple of simple things here. We\u2019ve not only passed through the full beat on top line and bottom line through the balance of the year. So the second half is every bit as intact as what it was prior, despite more headwinds. All of which should underscore the confidence that we have in our base business. And to Karleen\u2019s point, that is \u2013 the fourth quarter is not the ongoing run rate. Operator : We will take our next question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe a similar follow-up on that, I mean, just in terms of the Breast Health ramp back up as we get into the beginning of \u201823, what\u2019s the visibility into the supply chain normalizing there? I mean the confidence level that kind of corrects itself as we get into \u201823. Should we think of it as more kind of slowly ramping back up and being a bit of a drag on revenue margins to start \u201823%? Is the expenses kind of to Karleen\u2019s point, those are untapped? Growth is going to catch up. What\u2019s the right way to think about that as we look out to start of \u201823? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I would say that I would expect it not to be compared to \u2013 as we will see benefits from increased supply early in \u201823. But I think we will see, to your point, a normalization throughout the year is what I would think would happen because, even though we have a building backlog, it\u2019s going to take multiple quarters to work through it. As these installs of this equipment is highly scheduled with the hospitals and breast centers because typically have to take rooms down, its construction as well as the install takes almost a week. So, it\u2019s going to take several quarters to work through that. So, I would say, a normalization over the course of the year. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Steve, on the capital allocation side, what\u2019s the right way to think about? Obviously, you guys have done some share repos, you have done some deals. How do you balance the priority there? Obviously, the market is volatile and presents opportunities here and there. But what\u2019s the internal thinking? How large will you go on the deal side? What\u2019s the pipeline look like? Just an update there would be helpful. Steve MacMillan : Yes. I think the biggest thought we should leave you with is we are comfortable being patient right now. Just because we have a very strong amount of cash on the balance sheet doesn\u2019t mean we feel pressure to go do it in the next quarter or two quarters. We know that deals will present themselves in the quarters or years ahead. And I was showing Karleen our old headline from the late \u201808 timeframe at Stryker, where we were sitting on a pile of cash. And at the time, I was being criticized for being too conservative, and opportunities presented themselves over the next few years. And I think we feel very confident and frankly, should feel great in an uncertain world to be sitting with the balance sheet that we have relative to what we had 8 years or 10 years ago in this company. And it just gives us the ability to be patient and therefore, make great deals and continue to do a combination, some buybacks, but we still ultimately are looking and think there will be some good deals that will present themselves. And we are not going to get into the specific size. But obviously, we have got a fair amount on the balance sheet right now, and it doesn\u2019t mean we are ready to go below it all at once or anything else. I think we have been showing over the last 5 years or so, we are being very disciplined in and rigorous. Operator : We will take our next question from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Puneet Souda : Yes. Hi Steve, Karleen. Thanks for taking the question. So, maybe just the first one on the \u2013 some of the Panthers that you highlighted, the recent sales. Are those still going into a demand for COVID, or was that still a function of demand pull-through in January from COVID, or are customers now looking at the broader menu and saying \u2013 looking at Panther purchases from a broader menu perspective. And could you update us on any utilization trends? I know this is a major question in terms of the utilization of COVID conversion into other test. Maybe just walk us through sort of what\u2019s happening as we somewhat emerge out of pandemic into this and the mix situation? Steve MacMillan : Yes. The placements are really going for both COVID and new business. I think the magic for us is we have been able to expose Panther to so many new customers around the world. And they have seen the benefits both in COVID and it\u2019s also given us the chance to talk about the menu and the expanded menu. So, we are really getting them on both fronts. And I think every time we start to see customers getting ready to port some of the newer assays onto their machines, we have yet another spike. And candidly, we would have expected more base business growth this quarter. And then low and behold, we did another 28.5 million COVID tests. As a reminder, that\u2019s as much as we were doing practically globally, more than what we were doing globally pre-pandemic on all of our businesses combined. So, it\u2019s \u2013 I think people have become old to the numbers, but that has an impact in terms of our customers being able to adopt the other parts of the menu when again, they just got thrown back into huge testing. Now, I think as it plays out here in the coming quarters, we are assuming a much stronger and prolonged ramp down here in the COVID testing. That\u2019s going to really, we believe, allow the underlying strength of our core menu to start to shine through, and you will start to see it in these quarters. Puneet Souda : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a one-off question that we have been getting from investors given the China shutdowns, anything that you are baking from that side into the guide? And maybe just could you \u2013 if you could remind us your exposure there, both in terms of the revenue and impact to the supply chain? Thank you. Karleen Oberton : Yes. It\u2019s Karleen. I will tell onto that. So, less than 3% of our revenue comes from China. So, we have pretty minimal exposure. We do think there is some impact that is factored into our guide and we really don\u2019t have any manufacturing presence within China. I think what we are dealing with is the kind of global supply chain chip issue related to China. But from a revenue perspective, it\u2019s pretty immaterial. Operator : We will take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon. This is Griffin on for Brian. Thanks for the questions. Just continuing to talk about that OUS strength, I guess specifically in diagnostics, historically, those markets have had some less favorable reimbursement and just lower testing volumes with less screenings. And are you seeing any change in either of those dynamics as you think about the OUS outlook? Steve MacMillan : I think we see opportunities again over time to more directly influence the size of those markets and everything else. So, I think what we do see in the near-term is the ability with a lot of the additional Panthers we have placed to have more menu running through them. And then the second piece would be really helping to grow those markets more significantly over time. So, I think we feel very encouraged short-term from all the placements and longer term because of the strength that we have put in our teams. And frankly, the additional access we have gotten to a lot of the health ministers of the world through both COVID time as well as the Hologic Global Women\u2019s Health Index to, I think start to get women\u2019s health moved up the priority list, where we will be able to get more screening guidelines and things to put in place in the coming years, particularly in Western Europe. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then on the CT/NG, you noted we are back to pre-pandemic levels. Any notable changes in how you think about the basis of competition here, pre-pandemic versus endemic state or post-pandemic, particularly with some of the point-of-care molecular entrants in the STI market? Steve MacMillan : Yes. We will see where that all plays out. We are always very, very cognizant. But I think as we continue to think about how women are going to get these tests and the doctors and the reimbursements and everything else, I think we continue to feel very good about our position. Karleen Oberton : Yes. I would just emphasize that most of the CTMG testing is asymptomatic. So, when you think about at-home testing, it would be generated by a symptom, most \u2013 vast majority of the testing is asymptomatic and again, part of that well women\u2019s visit. Operator : We will take our next question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Tejas Savant : Hey guys. Good evening. Just a follow-up on some of your earlier comments on the chip shortages on the breast health side. Steve and Karleen, you spoke about that new allocation that you are expecting to see come through at the end of the second quarter, how \u2013 can you quantify that relative to that 20% number that you had spoken of earlier. And in terms of seeing the benefit in fiscal \u201823, is this largely sort of outside your control, or are there things you can do to accelerate those timelines, perhaps looking into different suppliers, etcetera? Karleen Oberton : So, in rough numbers, I think the increased allocation increased our expected unit production by about 20% to 25% in 2023. And I think from that initial, hopefully, we will get \u2013 we just don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t have that visibility to \u2013 with that allocation gets any higher, but that\u2019s what we are planning on right now. Tejas Savant : Got it. And any comments Karleen, on the possibility of new suppliers coming in here, or is that sort of all incorporated into your fiscal \u201823 recovery commentary? Karleen Oberton : Yes. What we know is kind of incorporated into the guide in our commentary, I think to try to bring on new suppliers would take multiple quarters. And I think the issue, the supply issue is not just our supplies, it\u2019s all the suppliers. So, it doesn\u2019t really solve the problem. Operator : Next question comes from Casey Woodring with JPMorgan. Casey Woodring : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about breast service? And if there is maybe any kind of pull forward you could do there to offset some of the near-term gantry cell headwinds? Karleen Oberton : Yes. No. So, breast service, we love our breast service revenue. It\u2019s \u2013 I think the comment was about 40% of the breast revenue in the quarter. But that \u2013 most of that revenue, the majority is tied to long-term service contracts. So, it\u2019s contracts that are over multiple years where the revenue is basically amortized over the contract period. And really it\u2019s tied to our installed base. So, we are not putting up more gantries, it\u2019s hard to do more service contracts. So, that\u2019s really \u2013 that\u2019s more of a stabilizing fact in that division versus the limited to pull forward. Steve MacMillan : Yes. Nor would we want to pull it forward quite harshly. I think what we love about that business is, it\u2019s stable and candidly we have got all the additional COVID revenue this year. What we are really looking forward to is, people will start to see the underlying strength of our base businesses in 2023. And the last thing we would want to do is mortgage some of that. Casey Woodring : Got it. And then just how should we think about the Panther competitive environment in the hospital setting as it relates to some of the smaller bench-top platforms when you think about and some of the other instruments out there with menu. Do hospital customers have both the Panther and the bench-top instrument and sort of how should we think about this dynamic moving forward given all the COVID placements? Steve MacMillan : Yes. Many do, but they are still largely used differently. A lot of the bench-top stuff is really for symptomatic and especially respiratory or other symptomatic stuff, whereas ours is largely asymptomatic and ongoing screening. So, I think this is going to be a question of and not or. And there is going to be meaningful opportunities on all fronts. I do think we are very well positioned and feel great about where we are with the Panther placements. So, I think we are very confident you are going to continue to see that, and that will unfold even more as the COVID revenue goes away. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys. This is Joseph on for Mike. I guess maybe one around gross margin. I guess given the capacity expansion to really meet COVID testing during the surges. And as we start seeing that declines, we see the volumes decline, should we expect some type of gross margin headwind in these next couple of quarters? Karleen Oberton : Well, certainly, as COVID revenue comes down, the gross margins will come down from where they have been. But from an absorption perspective, our manufacturing of COVID is fungible with all of our molecular diagnostics manufacturing. It\u2019s not a separate COVID line where we will have to mothball, if you will. I think the other piece of what has happened over the last 2 years is we have expanded our manufacturing, but that\u2019s been substantially funded by the Department of Defense and our contracts with them. So, there is really no big hit, if you will, for idle capacity. That was the question. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Yes, absolutely. That\u2019s very helpful. And then I guess maybe one more around the Panther systems. I know you guys have touched on that a lot. But as we are kind of looking towards that capacity utilization and non-COVID assays really going into these systems. I guess maybe there has been a lot of surges up and down. Obviously, hospitals are very flush. But I guess, what are you guys looking for to really push these forward, whether it be trainings that you guys have to schedule or whether it\u2019s just kind of waiting for total COVID cases to really reach a manageable level? Steve MacMillan : Yes. In terms of the base business, that\u2019s the \u2013 Joe, it\u2019s really around having the time to get the new assays up and running on the Panther within each hospital in each lab. But I would tell you, just from having \u2013 we are in our strategic plan process right now where we have been sitting down both with the U.S. diagnostics team, but also our international teams. And as we look at the optimism that they have for the underlying growth rates of our molecular business for the next few years, it gets pretty exciting. So, we are not ready to give guidance or anything on that front. But I think there is just the additional placements and the additional opportunities. And don\u2019t underestimate in a world where labor constraints and labor costs have become a huge issue. I think people are forgetting one of the massive benefits of the Panther is the workflow automation, the random batch access. This is the pen caps that we have. This is a remarkably efficient system that we think is only \u2013 and that\u2019s part of what the customers are seeing and looking forward to the future. So, I think it\u2019s going to bode very well for us. Operator : We will take our next question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Derik de Bruin : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, how do you feel about the long-term guide that you set out? You put out that 5% to 7% core growth CAGR through \u201825 on the 3Q \u201821 call. And I am just wondering, given the ship shortages, given what that is, I mean how do you \u2013 how is your confidence in that? I mean looking at the results this quarter I think some people are a little bit nervous. But are you still comfortable with that 5% to 7% number? Steve MacMillan : Very. It\u2019s a long-term thing. Obviously, we did not anticipate the chip shortage. And having said that, you know what, think about what those growth rates are going to be when we index against these quarters, next year. But even on a long-term basis, I think we feel very, very good about what the growth rates of our base businesses will probably be doing over the next couple of years. We have got a couple of punky quarters here right ahead of us to finish a year that\u2019s already a very strong year. And its growth rates as we start to look into \u201823, probably looking pretty good. Derik de Bruin : Okay. And as a placeholder for COVID for next year, that fourth quarter number, that $40 million to $50 million implied for COVID testing in Q4, is that a good way to sort of think about it just for now? Steve MacMillan : Yes. I almost don\u2019t even want to go there, Derik, is the quarterly swing who knows where it all goes, and I think we are poised either way. But I would put in a de minimis number for 2024, and yet I think we will certainly expect some volumes to continue to be there. So, probably not a horrible estimate, but we are nowhere near being able to give guidance. Operator : And we will take our final question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : Thanks for squeezing me in. And I will just keep it to one in the interest of time. So, on the breast health business, Steve or Kerleen, we have seen from some of your peers on the equipment side, certainly, commentary around softer demand, cost of debt is rising. You had alluded to the fact that the order book is pretty healthy or the backlog is healthy on the breast side. What do you attribute that to in terms of your capital equipment? Is it a site of service? Is it price points relative to maybe some of the $1 million-plus robots that are out there? I would just be curious to understand kind of how you think about the capital equipment demand market at the hospital level. Steve MacMillan : Yes. I think it starts with always having a superior product. And we have not gotten where we have gotten from a market share standpoint, particularly in mammography and especially in 3D without having a superior product. And I think \u2013 and also superior workflow throughout the whole gamut. And I think hospitals are seeing what we bring to them in a critically important area. To your second point, I will say, we are not of the high ticket items in a grand scheme, a hospital recapitalizing a few rooms in mammography or even several suites is nowhere near the magnitude of some of the bigger iron, the massive, whether it\u2019s robots or MRIs and those kinds of things. So, I think it does allow us to kind of be in a sweet spot where even if there is a little bit of capital contraction that we think we will be fine there. And I think our team is feeling very, very good. Ryan Zimmerman : Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Alright. Thank you. It sounds like it, operator. Lauren? Operator : Yes, sir. That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. This now concludes Hologic\u2019s 2Q 2022 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to the Hologic Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cody and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute.  And I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ryan Simon : Thank you, Cody. Good afternoon and thank you for joining Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer.  Our third quarter press release is available now on the investors section of our website, along with an updated corporate presentation. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. And a replay of this call will be available through August 26th.  Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are, one, organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue excluding the divested blood screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year. And two, organic revenue excluding COVID- 19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19, and discontinued product sales in Diagnostics.  Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Ryan. And good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Our results continue to showcase the strength, durability and diversity of our business. Total revenue was just over $1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.95. Both numbers exceeded the midpoint of our guidance on the top and bottom lines \u2013 the result of both enduring COVID revenue and also strong performances in our core Diagnostics and Surgical businesses.  In this dynamic and ever-changing world, we continue to live our purpose, passion and promise \u2013 to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day \u2013 and be global champions for women's health. In doing so, our industry-leading products continue to reach even more patients around the world, while our business delivers strong financial performance and value for our shareholders.  To put it simply, the durability and diversity of our business enables Hologic to succeed in this challenging macro environment. As we navigate a multitude of headwinds, our confidence in our business remains steady and remains high.  Looking longer term, our message is also unchanged. We are confident, despite the current turbulence, that our previously announced 5% to 7% annual organic revenue growth rate through 2025 remains an achievable target, provided the current chip headwind normalizes as we expect.  Ahead of turning the call over to Karleen to discuss our financial results in more detail, we'd like to highlight growth drivers and provide updates on each of our businesses \u2013 Diagnostics, Breast Health, and Surgical. And to close, we are excited to share our experience from the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in May, an experience that reaffirms the importance of our place and our voice on the world stage advocating for women's health, especially now. Before jumping into each division, it is important to revisit the impact of COVID on our business. The reality is that whether the demand for COVID testing is high or low, we are poised to succeed either way. We have a natural COVID hedge. As we have seen over the past two years, COVID prevalence affects each of our base businesses. As COVID cases rise, elective well-woman exams, screenings, and surgical procedures are often postponed. Conversely, as COVID declines, our base business strengthens.  As we responded with unprecedented speed to answer the world's needs for highly reliable molecular COVID testing, we also dramatically strengthened our company for the future.  We also know that many of you are trying to gauge the longer-term impact and durability of our additional Panther placements, as well as the impact of our various acquisitions over the last couple of years in Diagnostics and Surgical.  The truth is, the various surges in COVID cases around the world through many of the last quarters have often created wide variability in the comps, as some quarters reflect times of significant non-COVID related hospital and doctor visit slowdowns, while others bounced back stronger in varying geographies in any given quarter.  When we last reported in April, for example, our core Diagnostic and Surgical businesses posted year-over-year growth rates of 4% and 3.5%, respectively, amidst the COVID surge at the time. So, for anyone questioning these admittedly lower growth rates, we want to highlight two numbers from this quarter. The first number \u2013 22.4% \u2013 that was the growth in our global molecular diagnostic business, and the second number \u2013 9.7% \u2013 that was the growth in our Surgical business this quarter.  Now we'd encourage two simple takeaways from these results. One, these businesses have strong underlying growth; and two, the true growth rate is somewhere in between last quarter's results and this quarter's, underscoring the need to view how our strength evolves over time, and given the variability of COVID, that no single quarter result is going to match a linear model.  Now shifting gears to the businesses. First in Diagnostics, with COVID testing significantly down sequentially, our third quarter provided an opportunity for customers to validate and run more non-COVID assays on their Panther systems. As a result, our Diagnostic business grew 15% excluding COVID year-over-year worldwide, a truly phenomenal result and one that demonstrates the impact of women returning to their wellness exams and procedures.  Even more impressive, as mentioned earlier, our global molecular diagnostics business grew over 22% excluding COVID in the period. An early, yet clear sign that our expanded Panther installed base, is, A, being utilized, and, B, will prevail as an instrument of choice as customers consolidate their molecular testing menu to high- throughput, high-automation platforms.  For more color on the growth drivers within molecular diagnostics, performance was driven by a combination of both legacy and new assays, namely the BV/CV/TV vaginitis panel, M.gen, CT/NG and our respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion, to name a few. Our vaginitis panel continues to outperform and deliver impressive growth on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. As we have previously stated, the vaginitis panel is well positioned to become a top 3 assay in our molecular diagnostic portfolio over time.  International diagnostics was also a bright spot in the quarter. The business grew 16.5% excluding COVID, driven primarily by our virology portfolio.  As expected, Panther placements slowed to 59 new systems placed in the quarter, with nearly 70% of these placed internationally. While a decline from the 119 and 123 systems placed in our first two quarters, annualizing Q3's placements lands within our historic run rate of about 225 to 250 placements per year. As a reminder, Panther sales have minimal impact to the molecular diagnostic growth rate, as assays are the primary driver of growth, by far.  Further, placements at lower levels going forward is consistent with our expectations, given we have increased our Panther footprint by nearly 85% since the start of the pandemic. We now have roughly 3,200 Panthers installed worldwide.  To close out the Diagnostics update, our Biotheranostics business was again a highlight for the quarter, posting $18.9 million in sales, representing outstanding growth of 43%. Moving on to Breast Health. First and foremost, as to chip supply, we reiterate our statement from last quarter \u2013 we believe the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal 2022 will prove to be the low water mark in terms of chip availability for our gantries. Working closely with our suppliers, we observed positive trends in Q3. These positive trends include stabilizing lead times, procurement through a combination of channels, and most importantly, narrowing the breadth and depth of tight supply. Although we remain optimistic these positive trends will maintain throughout the remainder of our fiscal year, the situation remains fluid. As for gantries, demand remains strong. Our best-in-class technology, service, and customer satisfaction continues to differentiate and separate us from the competition. In addition, our sales force continues to place orders in line with quotas set prior to the chip headwind surfacing and there has been no meaningful change to the rate of cancelled orders.  On the chip supply chain recovery, while we are not providing fiscal 2023 guidance on this call, we do anticipate that chip supply, and thus gantry availability, will be recovering throughout fiscal 2023 and continue into 2024.  Next, in Surgical, the business returned to strong performance, posting 9.7% revenue growth in the third quarter. This growth was driven primarily by the combination of MyoSure, our Fluent Fluid Management System, and Bolder.  As a reminder, our MyoSure devices are used for fibroid and tissue removal and the Fluent system is complementary to MyoSure, assisting physicians with hysteroscopic procedures. The Fluent system simplifies and streamlines the historically complicated and cumbersome fluid management workflow used in these procedures.  While MyoSure and Fluent sales represent the lion's share of Surgical growth in the quarter, we are also very excited by the growth from our laparoscopic portfolio. Both the Acessa procedure and Bolder devices that we acquired to add growth and diversify the franchise performed well. Specifically, we are excited by the incremental progress in sales of the Acessa procedure. Smaller numbers but revenue growth of nearly 50% year-over-year, a meaningful step in increasing the utilization of this novel procedure.  Acessa's growth was driven primarily by two factors. First, excellent efforts from our team to increase patient covered lives to 84% compared to 26% when we first acquired the business about two years ago. With this critical mass of covered lives, which is often considered table stakes by many physicians, more doors were opened. Second, growth was also driven by more physician access to conduct monitored cases. Access was both in-person and also via our innovative virtual case monitoring platform. This virtual system was implemented specifically to address physician access challenges created by COVID.  As the COVID pandemic moves gradually to an endemic state and physician access improves, we are confident that Acessa will be a meaningful growth contributor going forward.  And finally, as many of you know, in May we had the opportunity to participate at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting held in Davos, Switzerland. At the Forum, we met with world leaders and change makers to further our mission and champion women's health.  Our message was clear, putting women's health at the forefront was long overdue. The time to elevate women's health, with the help of science-backed data to guide decisions and policy making, is now.  As we have said before, women's health is the cornerstone of families, communities, societies and economies around the world. With insights from our Hologic Global Women's Health Index, Project Health Equality and decades of leadership in women's health, we came to the Forum to make a difference. We left the Forum knowing we had. We understand change does not move in a straight line, and we are committed to supporting women every step of the way.  Before we turn the call over to Karleen, to conclude, we want to repeat that our third quarter results give us even more confidence in the strength of our business. This confidence is rooted in our demonstrated ability to absorb and adapt to the pressures and headwinds of this dynamic macroenvironment. As the current pressures and headwinds subside over time, we are in strong position to continue our durable growth trajectory for quarters and years to come. With that, let me turn the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve. And good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share third quarter results that once again significantly exceeded our guidance for both revenue and non-GAAP EPS.  Our third quarter financial performance highlights the strength of our core Diagnostics and Surgical businesses, both of which surpassed our long-term revenue target of 5% to 7% growth in the period. And in our Breast Health business, although we continue to see headwinds related to semiconductor chip availability, as Steve mentioned, we remain optimistic that the supply environment will start to improve in our fiscal 2023.  In terms of COVID-19 testing, we continue to showcase our agility in responding to highly variable global demand. And while we continue to meet our customers' COVID testing needs, we also have delivered on robust demand for our non-COVID molecular diagnostics menu.  Finally, cash flow generation in the third quarter was very strong, again coming in above pre-pandemic levels. As a result, our balance sheet remains an exceptional pillar of strength. Moving on, we will now provide more color on our financial results. In the third quarter, both top line performance and bottom line profitability were well ahead of our previous estimates.  Total revenue came in just over $1 billion, more than $100 million higher than the mid-point of our guidance, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.95, $0.25 higher than the mid-point of our prior guide.  Turning to our business results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $560.1 million declined 13.6% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID assay revenue, related ancillaries, and a small amount of revenue from discontinued products, worldwide organic Diagnostics revenue increased 15%, a great result against a solid comp in the prior year.  As a reminder, our organic results for fiscal Q3 2022 include Biotheranostics and Diagenode revenue, as these transactions have now annualized.  Within Diagnostics, our molecular business was exceptionally strong in our fiscal third quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19, molecular revenue grew over 22% organically in the period. Underlying this excellent result was strong utilization across our base molecular menu. As Steve highlighted, growth from our vaginitis panel led the way, while our virology portfolio also delivered strong performance. In addition, we saw stability in our core STI menu in the period, affirming our leadership position in women's health diagnostics.  While these Diagnostics results include a small amount of residual demand from the adverse impact of COVID felt in the second quarter, our molecular franchise continues to be a key catalyst of our future growth. We are very encouraged to see customers transition additional menu onto our Panther systems as COVID testing demand declines.  As it relates to our COVID results, we generated $173 million of COVID assay revenue in the quarter, exceeding our guidance of $100 million. We shipped about 8.1 million tests to customers, reflecting a global ASP of approximately $21. Although ASP held steady this quarter, we still believe that pricing will eventually fall as reimbursement declines.  In terms of COVID assay revenue split by geography, domestic demand was strong, while international demand declined throughout the quarter. The US COVID assay revenue represented approximately 60% of total COVID testing revenue in the period, a flip in geographic COVID demand versus the prior year, underscoring the variability of COVID revenue.  Rounding out Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal businesses increased 3.5% compared to the prior year. This result is reflective of patients returning to their well- women's exams after postponing these important visits during periods of high COVID prevalence.  In Breast Health, global revenue of $282.8 million was down approximately 18%, as expected, primarily driven by the chip supply shortages we have discussed over the past six months.  Related to gantries, we performed slightly better than anticipated. While our acquisition of chips in the quarter met our expectations, we again delivered slight favorability through reclaiming, refurbishing and recertifying printed circuit boards from servicing our gantry installed base.  Moving to Interventional Breast, the segment grew over 4% in our fiscal third quarter. This performance was driven by growth in Brevera's disposable needles. Customers continue to see the benefit of Brevera's differentiated and efficient biopsy workflow, especially as their labor resources have become increasingly constrained.  In Surgical, third quarter revenue of $138.1 million grew almost 10%. We are very pleased with the strong rebound in the business during the period, as positive procedural trends exiting our fiscal second quarter continued through June. Powering this quarter's performance for Surgical was a nice lift from MyoSure and the related Fluent Fluid Management System, plus Bolder. Lastly, in our Skeletal business, as expected, revenue of $21.7 million decreased approximately 14% compared to the prior-year period.  Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 63.3% was ahead of our forecast, driven by the higher-than-expected COVID-19 testing volume and strong results in our base businesses in the period.  Total operating expenses of $311.2 million in the third quarter increased less than 1% compared to the prior year. The increase in operating expense was driven by spend within marketing and R&D, partially offset by less G&A and sales expense. However, when we normalize for spending from Mobidiag and Bolder, operating expenses decreased 3% compared to the prior year.  Finally, our tax rate in Q3 was 21%, as expected.  Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q3 came in at 32.3%, and net margin was 24.1%, both above pre-pandemic levels.  Non-GAAP net income finished at $241.5 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.95.  Moving on from the P&L, cash flow from operations was $330.6 million in the third quarter. These robust cash flows continue to provide tremendous financial and strategic flexibility.  Based on this strong operational performance, we had $2.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage ratio was 0.2 times. As we have previously stated, we are comfortable building our cash balance during this challenging macro backdrop. That said, we continue to diligently pursue M&A opportunities in each one of our businesses.  Finally, while there were no share repurchases during the quarter, our share repurchase program remains an ongoing part of our capital deployment framework. So far this fiscal year, we have repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares for $367 million, a sizeable outlay of funds.  Now let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2022. As a reminder, our organic guidance excludes acquisition revenue until each deal annualizes. Therefore, our fourth quarter guidance only excludes Bolder revenue from our organic base.  Given our strong third quarter performance, we are once again increasing our full-year revenue and EPS guidance. For the full year, we now see total revenue in the range of $4.75 to $4.78 billion and EPS of $5.79 to $5.84, representing an increase of $115 million on the top line and $0.26 on the bottom-line compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance.  With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance implies revenue of $840 million to $870 million and EPS of $0.60 to $0.65 for our fiscal fourth quarter.  With respect to foreign exchange, given the unabated strength of the US dollar, we are assuming an FX headwind of slightly more than $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, nearly $10 million higher than our prior guidance incorporated for the quarter.  In terms of COVID sales, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $70 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $1.35 billion for the full year. COVID-related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue, are expected to be slightly less than $35 million in the fourth quarter and $215 million for the full year. As it relates to the Breast Health chip shortage, although we had marginal improvement versus expectations in Q3, guidance on the gantry revenue shortfall for the fourth quarter remains unchanged from our prior messaging.  Moving down the P&L, for the full year we forecast our non-GAAP gross margin percentage in the high 60s and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage in the high 30s to approximately 40%. Both estimates are well above pre-pandemic levels.  Further, our Q4 guidance incorporates the margin impact from our Breast Health supply chain revenue shortfall. As a reminder, gantry gross margins are accretive to consolidated averages, and we have maintained operating spend to be in position to move quickly once we receive chips. In addition, we have again incorporated elevated costs into our Q4 guidance as it relates to electronics, plastics and logistics.  In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be down a few million dollars sequentially. Below operating income, we expect other expenses, net, to be around $20 million in our fiscal fourth quarter.  Our guidance is based on an effective tax rate of 21% and diluted shares outstanding of around 250 million for the full year.  Finally, although we will update everyone on our fiscal 2023 guidance during our Q4 call next quarter, I would remind you that the headwinds related to higher input costs, the stronger US dollar, and increasing interest rates are unlikely to subside in the near-term. Like many other companies, we expect these headwinds to continue into the fourth quarter and into our fiscal 2023.  To help offset these pressures, as we do every quarter, we seek out efficiencies in our business and strategically manage pricing where we have the opportunity. Although these temporary challenges are not unique to Hologic, they are important to consider for modeling purposes.  To conclude, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted very strong third quarter results, underpinned by exceptional growth in molecular diagnostics and a healthy rebound in our Surgical business. We are also once again raising our financial guidance for the year. And although the future macro-outlook remains cloudy, with a natural hedge to future COVID uncertainties, as well as an increasingly strong balance sheet and best-in-class cash flow, we are well positioned to continue to deliver strong results for our shareholders.  With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : I wanted to go into the molecular results and the 22% organic growth ex COVID. If you look at the Panthers you've installed over the last couple of years for COVID, is it possible to call out now what portion are running something beyond COVID now as well? And also within that result, can you just break out how much the vaginitis revenue was in the quarter? Karleen Oberton : So I think from a \u2013 certainly in the US, the majority of our Panthers are running more than COVID, for sure. I think we are really pleased with the vaginitis growth, but I don't think we're going to give the absolute number at this time. Jack Meehan : On the COVID-19 side, would just be great to hear from you what you're hearing from customers and the government around demand as we head into the fall and the winter. Just you're going to be heading into guidance next quarter. Just any early thoughts around how you approach setting guidance for the first time for 2023 as it relates to COVID? Stephen MacMillan : I think when we get to that point, Jack, we'll probably continue to be conservative on the COVID side. It's been such a roller coaster for the last 27, 28 months or whatever that \u2013 it's almost been hard to predict within a quarter. We've watched a quarter start strong and then it dries up. And conversely, almost like this quarter, last year, it looked like everything was gone in July and August and then Omicron thing hit in \u2013 or Delta hit in September and things started to spike up. So we've had so many ups and downs that I think we'll be cautious as we forecast it.  Having said that, I think a lot of what we've said at the very beginning continues to play out. And for those who thought the business was going to be dead when vaccines came in, 18, 19 months ago, we continue to say that we always thought this was going to leave a residual business that was probably going to be around for quite some time and might be one of our top three or four assays.  And as we sit here today in the world with Japan and a whole bunch of other countries, very high and the US, as you know, is still running fairly rampant, and we said all along, the goal of herd immunity was not going to be achieved in a mutating virus, that this thing would become more endemic and probably create an opportunity for us to have a more ongoing business. I think we would see that and full expectations as we go into next fall and winter. This thing is not burned away from the world. So there will be some business. But I think we'll certainly model it on the lower side as we go in because it's just \u2013 we can count on our base businesses. This one truly is, call it, opportunistic or it's subject \u2013 we can't put a linear forecast on it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Tejas Savant : Steve, one on the CapEx environment here. I know you mentioned demand for gantries is pretty strong. You don't see an elevated cancellation rate, et cetera. What's your sort of line of sight into the order book here? We've had some sort of messaging from some of your medtech peers. Some of them not seeing any impact, others kind of like pointing to a softened CapEx environment here. So just curious as to get your take. Stephen MacMillan : Yeah, we're not really seeing or hearing it from our customers. And I think to a large degree, it's probably dependent on what products you're offering. Ours in the grand scheme are not a huge capital outlay for the hospital systems. We're also a both revenue and patient generating \u2013 top line generating procedure for the hospitals. So I think they will certainly find it. So, I think we're not hearing it. But I would say, as always, we're going to plan a little more cautiously and would expect that somewhere over the next couple of years does \u2013 is there a little bit of contraction here or there in all likelihood if we go into a recessionary environment. The flip side is, I think we've got pent-up demand. And I think even if there's a macro slowdown, we actually believe we've got some micro benefits working that will help us power right through that. Tejas Savant : Just a follow-up on your commentary around the slope of the recovery here on the gantry chips. I know in the past, you've talked about sort of having to figure out sort of construction timelines and installation timelines with your customers. Have you started to work on any of that here as you look to fiscal 2023? And your comments around perhaps the full recovery having to wait until FY 2024 here, are we on the margin a little bit more cautious than what you had shared earlier? Stephen MacMillan : I wouldn't say it's any more cautious. I think for anybody that's listened to the leaders of the semiconductor industry speak over the last six months plus, they've all been saying, look, recovery is not going to even happen throughout 2023, and it's going to go into 2024. And we're largely operating on kind of a quarter-to-quarter allocation right now. So we're at a cadence that is at least better than where it was, but I do think it's important for us to indicate this doesn't come bouncing back miraculously on the day you flip a calendar to a new fiscal year. Karleen Oberton : I'd just add that our field service engineers who want to maintain the gantries and the installed base are the ones that also do the install. So there is the balancing of our own resources to that recovery as well as hospital schedules. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Steve, maybe one on the 2023 setup. Again, I know you guys aren't going to give guidance. But in terms of the costs, and I know Karleen touched on it a little bit there at the end, what's the right way to think about some of those, whether it's higher input costs, the dollar, obviously, the supply chain on the chips, is the expectation that kind of lingers throughout most of 2023 and it's going to slowly work its way back? Just in terms of thinking about the margin cadence, it seems like most models would have it flipping pretty normal almost day one of 2023. So, I'm just trying to wrap our heads around the right way to think about that cadence and some of that cost pressure lingering into 2023. Again, not surprising that year 2023 obviously starts pretty soon here. But just trying to get a handle on the right way to think about that piece. Karleen Oberton : Patrick, it's Karleen. Let me try to give you some insight there. So when you look at our Q4, the Breast Health revenue headwind is probably roughly 400 to 450 basis points of a headwind on operating margins. Now that \u2013 I think as that business recovers over 2023, that will come back over the course of 2023. As far as costs, higher costs are probably about 200 to 250 basis points headwind on Q4. Now that we think might persist a little longer as inflationary pressures continue. So we think we've got good line of sight to how we get improvement from where we end Q4. Patrick Donnelly : Just on the molecular growth rates, another question \u2013 obviously, the number jumps off the page a little bit. Can you just talk through, Steve, I guess, what goes into that? Again, obviously, the acquisitions rolling into it, they flipped organic. Obviously, Mobidiag. Maybe just talk through kind of the different components where the real drivers of strength were because, again, I think that will be a focus coming out of it. It's obviously a big number. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. Clearly, our new product launches and especially BV/CV/TV, as we've talked to the vaginitis panel, is off to a very nice start. But it's kind of across the board. It's also still more customers that we sold more Panthers to during the pandemic that are now able to start to take on our core women's health assays. So, I think what's remarkable is it's fairly dispersed growth, which I think both geographically and across product lines. So, there's no one that completely dominates it. And I think that's what gives us a lot of confidence for the future. Karleen Oberton : Yes. I would say, of the acquisitions, Biotheranostics is probably the most significant component of growth in the quarter, as we would expect that one to be\u2026 Stephen MacMillan : Which we called out. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Nisarg Shah : This is Nisarg on for Derik. So I want to start off on the margins. Do you guys still think the 32% to 33% range is the right way to think about fiscal year 2023 margins? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So what I would say is when we have a normalized chip supply, that is exactly the way to think about them in the low 30s. I'd point to our Q2 of 2020, which was 31.5% operating margin. We believe that is a normalized baseline, if you will. But, again, that recovery on the chip is going to occur over the course of 2023. We're still in that planning stages of how and when. So it won't be kind of Q1 out of the gate likely. Nisarg Shah : One more. Like have you seen any changes on the order book for Breast Health, how much catch-up do you think we could see there as the chip shortage issues gradually go away in. Karleen Oberton : I think as we said in our prepared remarks, the sales teams are hitting quota that were set prior to the chip shortage. So we haven't seen any deviation in the booking rate. And again, as Steve mentioned, no increase in the cancellation rate. So we think the business is still solid. We're not losing any share, and then it will just be, again, availability of chips in the scheduling of the installs that we'll be working on to manage through the recovery. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Vijay Kumar : Karleen, I have two on the guidance. One on breast imaging. I think the prior guidance had $250 million of headwind for fiscal 2022. I think that number changed. Looks like 3Q came in better. What is that updated number? And what is the implied breast imaging headwind for Q4? Shouldn't Q4 be improving based on 3Q trends? Karleen Oberton : So you're right, we did guide to $250 million. It was $50 million in Q2, $100 million in Q3 and $100 million in Q4. We did slightly better, like you said, about $10 million better here in Q3. I think we're holding to the $100 million in Q4, again, because that favorability, Vijay, was done by kind of blood, sweat and tears of reclaiming and recertifying circuit boards and just don't know if we'll continue to have those yields in this quarter. So we just \u2013 it's best to be conservative and that's the $100 million for Q4. Vijay Kumar : I did have an OpEx question. If we look at the Q4 guidance at the high end, $870 million of revenues, $0.65 EPS, I think the guide implies OpEx on a dollar basis as sequentially flattish. If we annualize that Q4 number, I think the implied OpEx for next year, somewhere north of $1.2 billion. Is that math correct just based on, I think, your commentary on \u2013 you'd hold the OpEx line on the assumption that the chip shortage will resolve eventually? Karleen Oberton : Again, Vijay, for 2023, we're still in the planning process, budgeting process. So, not going to comment. But I would just \u2013 the only insight I would give you is that, with our partnership with the WTA, is that the expense of that is loaded into calendar 2022. So most of that then expenses \u2013 disproportionate amount of expenses in our fiscal 2022, which will be a tailwind as we get into 2023 and 2024. Operator : We'll move on to our next question from Mike Matson with Needham. Joseph Conway : This is Joseph on for Mike. So, I guess there in the pandemic, STI rates seem to have spiked and, currently, they still seem to be at or near record highs. Maybe just to start off, can you talk about maybe some of the barriers that are currently in place in the industry that if removed could increase screening rates?  And then maybe similar question. As we saw with COVID testing moving to the at-home testing, do you see this as a potential market for STI testing? And then, if that were to introduce, I guess, what will the Hologic's solution there for staying competitive and if that includes looking at at-home testing options? Stephen MacMillan : On the first part of that, in terms of barriers to STIs, we did see a lot of, call it, intercity clinics and everything that either shut down or got their resources redeployed during COVID time from serving STIs and just serving their community folks really focusing on COVID. So as some of those come back, I think we feel good about hopefully the ability to get back to more screening. And as you say, there's probably been an increase, certainly, we've seen in many pockets of STIs during this time. So, hopefully, the ability to pick those up.  On the idea of home testing, there's a lot more complications to women testing themselves at home in terms of administering the test and in terms of shipping it in a proper container and everything else. So, candidly, we were approached by lots of companies in COVID time who all were convinced that they were going to be the next great savior of home testing for COVID as well as home testing for STIs that don't \u2013 we're not as sure that market is going to move nearly as quickly to home testing when you actually think about the pragmatic realities of it. And so, I think we continue to feel very good. We continue to broaden out our own portfolios, our partnerships to be able to try to capture them. But I would not expect that market to move nearly as quickly as some companies might be hoping.  By the way, I'd also say, if it were, it's where our cash balance puts us in a really good position. Joseph Conway : I did happen to see \u2013 I don't know if you guys already got a chance to look at it, but it seems that NCCN posted new guidelines for breast cancer screening and diagnosis. Just like a quick look at it. It didn't seem like anything really changed, more or less just solidifying diagnosis pathways based on your risk. But can you maybe talk about anything that was seen in that update?  And then maybe just a similar question on that. What's maybe been the reception of some of the mobile mammogram screening that Hologic has put out? How has that been received during the pandemic and recently? Stephen MacMillan : I think as it relates to guidelines, we continue to push for the proper guidelines. I think sometimes USPSTF and some other folks have gone too far. But in general, most of the folks, I think, are adhering to pretty sensible guidelines. And candidly, I think there's still a lot of pent-up demand. There's still a lot of women that put off their screenings during COVID time and are running behind. So I think we'll still catch up.  In terms of the mobile, we made those available here and there. It's de minimis in terms of any real impact on the business. Karleen Oberton : Right. We've been doing mobile mammograms well before the pandemic really to reach underserved communities, is really the intent there. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Puneet Souda : First one, maybe for Karleen. How much of an offset are you getting today from repurposing of these prior boards and chips? And how much of that do you expect will happen in FY 2023 versus new chips? Karleen Oberton : It's pretty de minimis. And if I look at Q3, we did better than the original forecasted $100 million of headwind by roughly $10 million. So it's in the millions of dollars. And again, I wouldn't think that it's going to be the most significant solution to the challenges of supply. It's going to be getting higher allocations. Puneet Souda : Steve, on the first fiscal quarter call, you said corrections do create opportunities for Hologic at the right time, but valuations hadn't settled back at that time in your view. So, obviously, macro backdrop hasn't improved, but valuations have come down here meaningfully. So wondering if you have updated thoughts and views on how you're viewing the market and valuations now given your sort of vantage point and the growing cash position and still strong cash flow. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. We like seeing some of the valuations start to truly settle in. The fascinating part always becomes \u2013 people are always still looking at the past 52 months \u2013 past 52-week high and wanting premiums off of that, even though it's long since history. So the more time that goes by, we believe, puts us in a better position and really puts the potential sellers in a more realistic position. We feel great right now being patient and feel like \u2013 we don't see something that's going to snap a lot of these, especially earlier stage or smaller companies back. And we're looking both early stage, and we're also looking at things that bring some legitimate EBITDA in this time, but really like our position. And we're in no urgent need, given the strength of our base business, to act, which I think also just puts us in a much better place while these companies come to grips with their true realities. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Casey Woodring with J.P. Morgan. Casey Woodring : I guess the first one, so on the Diagnostics growth rate here, wondering how much of that was pent-up demand from the last quarter or two. So last quarter, you guys made the comment that women's wellness business have softened given COVID impact. So curious to hear if there's a catch-up in visits this quarter and if there's some more pent-up demand to your left in 4Q and maybe even the beginning of fiscal 2023? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. It's probably a little bit. It's so hard for us to say that these things just keep ebbing and flowing by geography. Both within the US, you see regions that move to different paces in COVID time, and certainly on a global basis, different countries. So it feels like a little bit of pent-up, but I wouldn't say that created a big bolus. I think it just more allowed a lot of the visits to come through that weren't happening before. So, I think it's a pop, but it's not like it was necessarily restrained. And again, hard to exactly know. We don't have that information from our customers or anything else. But I think it's where we just keep saying, let's keep watching these trends over time. Casey Woodring : Just on the international diagnostics piece, you called out 16.5% ex COVID growth was driven by virology. You did mention women's health there. So I guess can you just sort of remind us how much of that diagnostics business you have is outside the US and if there's material greenfield opportunity on the molecular side with women's health, especially given all the Panthers you've placed? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. Our molecular business outside the US has been underdeveloped. And I think that's been one of the magical pieces of the \u2013 being able to place so many Panthers during the pandemic that we're very excited about the opportunity, really in the core women's health business, which has also been underdeveloped. So it's a combination of both the virals and the core women's health as we start to transition from some of those Panthers internationally that we used for COVID into our core business. And I think that's something we expect to be generating certainly double-digit growth internationally for quite some time in that molecular business. Operator : We'll take our next question from Max Masucci with Cowen and Company. Max Masucci : First one, I think you're nearly done integrating Biotheranostics lab operations into the San Diego headquarters, if not finished. The growth is tracking nicely there. So, once Biotheranostics has fully settled into the San Diego headquarters, how motivated will you be to pursue additional M&A deals for, say, a breast-focused specialty lab that you would be able to serve with Biotheranostics, the new lab operations and the commercial team that's in place? Stephen MacMillan : We're continuing to look at all options. I think what we do feel good about, and as you say, Matt, we did a whole bunch of acquisitions in a relatively compressed period of time. and then really had to digest those. And I think between Biotheranostics, which is not fully integrated, we're probably slightly behind exactly your rosy synopsis here. We're integrating it into the San Diego facility and moving the CLIA lab in and all of that, but we still have a little bit of work to be done.  The same with Diagenode and Mobidiag getting integrated nicely. Boulder, Acessa, those have all been being integrated to where I would say we're getting to the point where we can certainly handle more integrations, but we're casting the net fairly broadly within our existing state of business, the existing three businesses. Max Masucci : Just sort of following up there, if you look at all of the companies and the products that you have integrated over the past 18 to 24 months, which of the recently acquired products or services, whether it's Acessa or some of the expanded interventional breast offerings, which of them have benefited the most under Hologic's ownership or when they started being marketed alongside some of your cornerstone and marquee products. Stephen MacMillan : I think they're all benefiting very nicely. If you think about what we've been able to do from a covered live standpoint within Acessa, early stages even for Boulder, our surgical sales force is dying to get their hands on it. It's been more a supply issue that we've been holding them back a little bit while we ramp up. Biotheranostics, that team, when you talk to the commercial leader of that team, very excited by what the Hologic team and breadth and marketing capabilities and everything have brought to that business as well. The Diagenode, Mobidiag teams, I think, also in Europe, very excited, particularly having to just have gone through the whole IVDR process, which was a hugely labor-intensive business now to get that behind us and really focus to the future. So I think they're all looking at us and saying, you know what, nice part is they're proud to be a part of us. I was talking to a CEO of another company recently who actually been involved in ones we bought, and he was still close to one of the members of the team at the company we bought, and he said, 'you know what, that team loves being a part of Hologic.' And that's exactly what we always want to strive for. So I feel pretty good that each of them are really fitting that bill. Operator : We will now take the next question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : And I wanted to just ask one, Karleen. It's already been asked a lot about op margins for next year. And I appreciate the color there. I think you had said maybe 400, 450 basis point headwind on op margins and that will come back over 2023 in a normalized environment. But if I look at the fourth quarter number next quarter, op margins are kind of sitting at 26%. And so, you add back kind of that 400 basis point dynamic. And it puts it closer \u2013 and maybe I'm splitting hairs here, but closer to 30%. And I just want to know if I'm thinking about it the right way versus \u2013 and, again, in a normalized environment, 32-ish percent, 31.5%. Are we still maybe 100, 150 basis points off of kind of that normalized margin as we enter 2023? And then I have a follow-up. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So I think beyond, as I talked about the 400 to 450 basis points is this, the higher cost of roughly 200 basis points to 250 basis points, which from a planning perspective, we don't have line of sight to that resolving, but eventually, that will resolve. And I think the other piece was some higher marketing expenses, which is probably about another 200 basis points headwind to op margin that will also abate over 2023. So we have clear line of sight back to those normalized margin levels. Ryan Zimmerman : I think Mobidiag laps next quarter in terms of the time of acquisition becomes organic. The disclosure today for both Mobidiag and Boulder was about $8 million. If I go back to the revenue contribution from Mobidiag, I think it was something in the 40s. I just want to understand kind of how that's tracking relative to maybe its previous disclosures. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Karleen Oberton : It's tracking a little bit below that, and there's two reasons. One, that 4 handle would have had COVID revenue in there that has come down. That COVID revenue was on their legacy Amplidiag platform, not the Novodiag platform. And as well as there's been some supply chain challenges. We've worked through those. And we're ramping up inventory to kind of go hard commercially at the beginning of 2023. So, a couple of choppiness here in the year, but feel still really good about what that's going to do. Operator : We'll take the next question from Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Andrew Cooper : A lot has already been asked. So maybe I'll just give one quick one and let everybody go on. So, on Mobidiag, maybe just an update on Novodiag potentially coming to the US and sort of what's the latest and greatest thinking on the pathway there and what we should be looking for for that product? Karleen Oberton : I think to Steve's earlier comments about the benefits of these acquisitions in Hologic's hand, I think our R&D teams have spent a lot of time in Finland and Mobidiag's teams have come to San Diego to really work through what that clinical road map is for approval in the US. And I think we're in a much better position of understanding of what is required for approval in the US, in that understanding based on our expertise has pushed out the time line a little. So looking now more like early 2025. But we still feel really good about that acquisition. We feel good about what's going to happen with the EU approvals that we already have here in 2023. Operator : Thank you. And this now concludes Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to the Hologic\u2019s Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jennie, and I am your operator for today\u2019s call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ryan Simon : Thank you, Jennie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining Hologic\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. With me today are; Steve MacMillan, the company\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation and a replay of this call will be available through November 30th. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings.  Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are : one, organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue excluding the divested Blood Screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year.  And two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and discontinued product sales in Diagnostics. Finally, any percentage change we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.  Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. Happy Halloween. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and provide guidance for fiscal 2023. It was another dynamic year for Hologic, delivering strong performance while navigating macro headwinds and we closed 2022 once again posting outstanding results for the quarter.  Total revenue was $953.3 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.82, exceeding both our base business and COVID guidance. We also deployed $175 million of capital to buy back 2.5 million shares in the quarter. For those of you keeping score, for the full year, we utilized $542 million of our exceptional cash flow to repurchase 7.7 million shares, reflecting great confidence in our future. For today's call, we'll first provide a high-level overview of our fourth quarter performance and then reflect on our full year results. In doing so, we'll also share insights into our future outlook as we look forward to 2023.  Overall, make no mistake, our consistent strong performance in these turbulent times is no coincidence. We are a fundamentally different company today than when we entered the COVID pandemic. We also understand that some of you are still trying to ascertain the strength of our core businesses. As we look ahead, each of our core franchises, listen closely here, diagnostics, breast and surgical are expected to produce low double-digit top line growth for fiscal 2023. As we set out to do just over two and half years ago, we are emerging from the pandemic a much stronger company we thoughtfully and strategically reinvested our upside earnings into both our business and into our passion to be champions for women's health. Our ability to step-up to the plate during the pandemic and address the global demand for COVID testing was an incredible achievement. But our real home run was the transformation of Hologic that cannot be ignored. Through organic and inorganic additions, we now have more growth drivers across our business in each of our divisions than ever before. These growth drivers layered on top of our market-leading core franchises form a solid foundation that anchors our business in these volatile and pivotal times. Under the intense pressures of the macroeconomic landscape we live in today, all companies will face adversity. That said, because Hologic is a much stronger company today, we will thrive. As we've said before, you can count on us to deliver on our commitments even in the face of volatility and uncertainty. It's equally important to recognize that our revenue is the least capital sensitive it has ever been in our 36-year history. For fiscal 2022, given COVID and the impact from chip shortages, only 12% of our revenue was from capital. A percentage we expect will settle well below pre-pandemic levels. A truly astounding change from where we were just a few years ago, and a transformation that makes Hologic a more durable company in the face of a potential recessionary environment. Our confidence and conviction in our business is underpinned by our unwavering commitment to our purpose-driven business strategy, a strategy that is centered around our purpose to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day. Our passion to become global champions for women's health and our promise the science of sure. We don't see our commitment to mission and ESG as a trend or fad. Instead, we know that in order to continue to achieve our strong financial results, we must continue on our path to elevate and improve women's health and well-being around the world. Now let's turn to the quarter results. As expected, our strong performance was driven primarily by both our molecular diagnostics and surgical businesses. To answer the question, we're sure many of you are wondering. Core Panther utilization is strong. Our Molecular Diagnostics business grew north of 17% in Q4, excluding COVID, driven primarily by more assays being run through our expanded Panther installed base. This exceptional growth was once again broad-based and fueled by a combination of legacy and newer assays in our robust molecular portfolio. Our legacy STI business contributed growth dollars while our newer assays, including our vaginitis panel, MGen and our virology portfolio lifted the growth rate. As for Panther placements, we now have nearly 3,250 Panthers placed around the world. A remarkable achievement considered we exited fiscal 2019 slightly north of 1,700 Panthers in the field. In Surgical, our business grew nearly 9% organically and over 11%, including the Bolder acquisition. As anticipated, the COVID pressure on our surgical business abated in the quarter, and we saw procedural volumes return as well as acceleration from our new business lines. Powering the strong performance in Surgical were the same growth drivers as in Q3, MyoSure, Fluent and solid contributions from Bolder and Acessa. In Breast Health, as expected, the business was down 16%, driven primarily by the chip shortage adversely impacting our gantry business. Having said that, we have confidence that the worst of the shortage is behind us and that the business will return and accelerate throughout 2023. We will go into more depth on Breast Health later in the call. Shifting gears. We will now reflect on our full year results and outlook for fiscal 2023. For 2022, Diagnostics grew 10.2% and Surgical grew 6.3% and Breast and Skeletal Health declined 7.7%, driven primarily by constrained gantry sales as a result of chip shortages. Net without the chip shortage, it is very clear that each of our businesses would have been solidly at or above our long-term guidance. As a reminder, each of these figures are in constant currency, exclude acquisitions until they annualize and also exclude COVID assays and as well as COVID-related and discontinued products revenue. We are extremely proud of where we landed in both Diagnostics and Surgical. And we have high confidence that the concentrated impact on Breast Health will rebound strongly in 2023. Looking forward by division, as mentioned at the onset of this call, each of our businesses, including international, is expected to achieve low double-digit growth in fiscal 2023. In Diagnostics, powered by our vastly expanded Panther installed base, we expect low double-digit growth from the division in 2023, bolstering growth for the division we expect continued strong sequential growth from Biotheranostics as well as incremental contribution from Mobidiag internationally. Focusing on molecular diagnostics, our growth thesis centers on more customers running more volume and more menu on our Panther systems. While we are still in the early days of ramping utilization, we are already seeing positive signs today. With our broad menu, we are well-positioned to continue double-digit growth in our core molecular Panther business in 2023. To provide additional color and shed more light on non-COVID Panther utilization, pre-COVID at the end of our fiscal 2019, about 20% of US customers we're running at least four assays on their Panther systems. Fast forward to the close of Q4, now over 33% of US customers are running at least four assays, nice improvement and still future opportunity ahead. Moreover, last quarter, we spoke to the fact that over 90% of all COVID customers were running at least one other non-COVID assay. Many of you asked, what about new customers acquired during COVID? As of the Q4 close, over 85% of new customers worldwide are running at least one other assay on their Panthers in addition to COVID. More impressive is that over 55% of these new to Hologic customers, are running at least two non-COVID assays on their Panthers, a strong signal of future utilization at new customer sites. While still early, we expect these positive utilization trends to continue in the quarters and years to come. Now turning to Surgical. We also expect Surgical to deliver low double-digit growth in 2023. Consistent with the last two quarters of 2022, we believe MyoSure and Fluent plus Acessa and Boulder will lead the way. We expect the division's revenue to accelerate as we continue to integrate our acquired laparoscopic assets into the business and into the bags of our strong surgical sales force. Increased physician access and payer coverage for our laparoscopic portfolio should continue to improve over time and be a tailwind for growth. Longer term, our goal is to build both Acessa and Boulder into $100 million plus surgical brands that will complement our market-leading NovaSure and MyoSure products. In Breast Health, we fully expect to exit 2023, achieving low double-digit top line growth from the supply constrained 2022 comps. We have confidence the worst of the chip shortage is behind us. As chip supply normalizes, as it should over the course of 2023. We expect our gantry business to return to strength. Frankly, as we work down the backlog, we have the opportunity to perform slightly above the historical gantry placement run rate, as we exit the fiscal year. Even with the shortage of gantries we faced in 2022, we maintained our market-leading position in the US grew our presence internationally and have no reason to believe we are giving any ground to the competition. In fact, the backlog for our best-in-class gantries continues to grow, and we continue to receive orders at a healthy rate. We also understand capital budgets may face increased pressure given the macro environment. Despite this challenge, we remain confident in our ability to place gantries even if we enter a recession. The reality is that gantries tend to be at the lower price point of hospital capital spend. Gantries also represent both a value-driving opportunity for our customers and more importantly, essential capital equipment for world-class patient care. Finally, our international business will continue to be a tailwind and a powerful lever of growth for each division. In 2022, our international business grew just north of 6% organically, excluding COVID, posting strong growth even with the chip headwind and constrained gantry supply. International is now nearly 30% of total revenue and poised to continue its growth trajectory. Looking forward to 2023, we are confident our international business, excluding the impact of COVID, will return to double-digit top line growth and sustain the momentum created by our strong response to COVID and from our groundbreaking initiatives like the Hologic Global Women's Health Index and our global access initiative. To conclude, at Hologic, we know we must center on our purpose to achieve our strong financial results. From our strong results, we will continue to drive patient education and access initiatives, and continue to invest in our business. From our strategic investments, we will continue to deliver innovative, life-changing technologies. These technologies will power our perpetual cycle of reaching and helping more patients, all while delivering value and strong financial results for our shareholders. Before turning the call over to Karleen, let me close by saying that we are incredibly excited about where we have been and even more excited about where we're headed. And finally, from me personally and the rest of our global leadership team, we would like to thank and congratulate each and every one of our nearly 7,000 employees around the world for their dedication to our purpose and another incredible year at Hologic. With that, let me hand the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share our fourth quarter financial performance, capping off the end to an excellent fiscal year. These results highlight our current position of strength as well as tremendous opportunities that lie ahead. Growth in the period was powered by our core diagnostics and surgical businesses, as both franchises posted strong growth to close 2022. For a second quarter in a row, these businesses each showcased multiple growth catalysts. And as we look towards our fiscal 2023, we are excited to drive this momentum forward. In Breast Health, we are proud of the resilience of our teams. Although our chip allocations are still constrained, we believe that the worst of the vision supply chain problems are in the rare view. As I will highlight in more detail when discussing our guidance for next year, we should see continuous improvement in our chip supply and thus gantry revenue throughout fiscal 2023. Finally, before moving on to our divisional results, it is important to reiterate that our balance sheet is a key point of strength as we head into fiscal 2023. Our leverage rate remains far below our target range and our capital structure is pristine, providing our business incredible confidence and flexibility, given the increasingly uncertain macro environment. Moving on, I will now provide more color on our financial results. In the fourth quarter, revenue and profitability once again significantly exceeded our estimates, as total revenue came in at $953.3 million. This result was nearly $100 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance, despite a greater-than-expected FX headwind of approximately $27 million in the quarter. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.82, roughly $0.20 higher than the midpoint of our prior guide. Turning to our businesses results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $520.9 million declined 35.6% compared to the prior year. However, it is important to note that COVID testing revenue was elevated in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021 due to the onset of the Delta variant. Therefore, a more accurate depiction of the state of the Diagnostics business is to exclude COVID assay revenue, related ancillaries and a small amount of revenue from discontinued products. When making these adjustments, we see that worldwide organic diagnostics revenue increased 11% in the quarter, a fantastic result. Within Diagnostics, our molecular business was again extremely strong, growing more than 17% in the fourth quarter when excluding the impact of COVID-19. Growth in molecular was broad-based, driven by solid performance in our legacy STI portfolio, as well as continued success of both our vaginitis panel and our virology menu. These results in conjunction with the exceptional performance of our molecular business last quarter, highlights strong traction in our base Panther business. As it relates to our COVID results, we generated $151 million of COVID assay revenue in the quarter, well exceeding our previous guidance. In terms of COVID assay revenue split by geography, Domestic demand outpaced our expectations, with the US COVID assay revenue representing nearly 70% of total COVID testing revenue in the period. As expected, international demand continued to moderate. Rounding out Diagnostics, our Cytology and Perinatal businesses increased 1.5% compared to the prior year. In Breast Health, global revenue of $271.1 million was down 16% as expected, primarily driven by chip supply shortages. For Q4, the impact to revenue from the chip supply shortage was in line with our prior guidance. In Surgical, fourth quarter revenue of $133.3 million grew more than 11%. And excluding the Boulder acquisition, the business grew nearly 9%. We are very encouraged by another strong quarter from our surgical franchise as the momentum we saw in our fiscal third quarter continued into our fiscal fourth quarter. The division's results were again led by MyoSure and Fluent with contributions from recent acquisitions. Lastly, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $24 million increased approximately 4% and compared to the prior year period. Now, let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 62.5% was ahead of our forecast, driven by higher than expected COVID-19 testing volume and strong results in our base business in the period. Total operating expenses of $329.9 million in the fourth quarter decreased 6.6% compared to the prior year period. This decrease was driven by less spend within G&A and sales, partially offset by higher marketing and R&D expense. Below operating income, other income was an expense of $3.1 million, less than anticipated, primarily due to gains associated with our foreign exchange hedging activities. Finally, our tax rate in Q4 was 21% as expected. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q4 came in at 27.9% and net margin was 21.8%, both ahead of our previous estimates. Non-GAAP net income finished at $207.5 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.82. Moving on from the P&L, cash flow from operations was $168.7 million in the fourth quarter. Based on a strong cash conversion, we had $2.3 billion of cash on our balance sheet our leverage ratio was 0.2 times. Our cash generation continues to be excellent and our balance sheet remains a pillar of strength. Both positive attributes in any environment, but are especially valuable in cares of macro instability like we face today. And although we have continued to build cash, our M&A teams in each division remain active and our funnel of potential tuck-in opportunities is robust. As it relates to share repurchases, they remain an integral part of our capital deployment strategy moving forward. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $175 million. Further, on September 22nd, our Board of Directors approved a new five-year share repurchase authorization for up to $1 billion. Now, let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2023. As a reminder, our organic guidance excludes acquisition revenue until each deal annualizes. Therefore, our first quarter guidance only excludes Boulder revenues from our organic base. Boulder becomes organic in our fiscal second quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect strong financial results again with total revenue in the range of $940 million to $990 million. For all of fiscal 2023, we expect total revenue in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion, significantly exceeding our pre-pandemic levels. This guidance assumes low double-digit organic revenue growth, excluding COVID in each division for the full year fiscal 2023. To help with the constant currency modeling, we are assuming significant foreign exchange headwinds of slightly more than $30 million in the first quarter of 2023, and approximately $90 million for the full year. Please note that while we have taken a conservative view when considering the strength of the US dollar, currency markets continue to be very unpredictable. In terms of our divisions, we expect Breast Health, Surgical and Core Diagnostics, excluding the impact of COVID to grow low double digits for 2023. In Diagnostics, we expect our molecular business to continue to drive growth. Our Panther continues to deliver incredible benefits for our customers through assay consolidation, scalability and automation. In this environment, where labor remains a scarce resource, our highly automated Panther is a tremendous value proposition. With nearly 20 assays on the menu, we are eager to capitalize on this great opportunity to increase utilization on our expanded installed base. Finally, as Steve mentioned, we now have approximately 3,250 Panthers placed globally, placing more than 350 Panthers in fiscal 2022 and 49 units in Q4. Going forward, we will return to reporting Panther placements on an annual cadence. Moving to Breast Health. We are excited for the year ahead. Our customer base is hungry for our best-in-class thermography instrumentation. We continue to expect chip supply to gradually improve throughout 2023, and therefore, the division's revenue should increase throughout the year. And while we only have line of sight to allocations impacting revenue about two quarters out, we remain optimistic that the gantry business will exit fiscal 2023 at or near normalized levels. As it relates to our guidance, we expect Breast Health revenue to be down low double digits in our first fiscal quarter of 2023 given that the prior year was not yet impacted by supply chain shortages. However, for the full year, our guidance assumes the Breast Health will grow low double digits, reflecting supply recovery as the year progresses. Finally, in Surgical, we expect more broad-based growth than ever before. We anticipate MyoSure will continue to drive growth, but also expect notable lift from our Fluent Fluid management system as well as our laparoscopic portfolio of Acessa and Bolder. In terms of COVID sales, consistent with prior messaging, we believe COVID could be one of our largest molecular assays over the long-term. Having said that, given how quickly we've seen the pandemic change course, we believe it is still too early to accurately forecast an endemic state. As a result, we expect COVID assay sales to be $75 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $150 million for the full year. COVID related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be approximately $35 million in the first quarter and $130 million for the full year. Moving down the P&L. For the full year, we forecast our non-GAAP gross margin percentage in the low 60s, and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Please note that we anticipate or COVID revenue, which is margin accretive, will be front-end loaded to the first half of 2023 to coincide with the fall and winter seasons in the US. In addition, we have again incorporated elevated inflationary pressures into our guidance as it relates to input costs. We foresee these higher costs persisting throughout 2023. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be down compared to the prior year. While we will continue to invest in our business Marketing spend will be lower in fiscal 2023, as our fiscal 2022 had several large onetime expense items, such as our Super Bowl commercial and higher spending for initiatives such as our WTA partnership. Below operating income, we expect other expenses net to be around $20 million a quarter. Our guidance is based on an effective tax rate of approximately 19% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $252 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 to $0.90 in the first quarter, and $3.30 to $3.60 for the year. To conclude, let me wrap-up by saying that, our strong fourth quarter results once again exceeded our guidance despite the various macro headwinds. Performance was driven by exceptional growth in our molecular diagnostics and surgical businesses, which we expect to continue. And while the future macro outlook remains uncertain with a natural hedge to future COVID uncertainties, and a fortress balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue strong results in our fiscal 2023. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to our first question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Stephen MacMillan : Hey, Patrick. Patrick Donnelly : Steve, maybe one -- hey Steve, how are you? May one for you on the Breast Health side, it sounds like the gantry backlog continues to build, good order pace. Can you just talk, I guess, about the visibility into that chip improvement? Obviously, again, the guidance kind of implies as the year goes. You guys -- you talked about the exit rate. I think improvement kind of mid-year. But, yeah, maybe just talk about the visibility there, again, on the order side. Are you seeing any share shift or kind of customers staying with you guys through this? And then similarly, just on kind of sound on the gantries you mentioned even in a recession, we feel pretty good about what the order growth would look like. I guess, what gives you that confidence, a lot of questions about hospital CapEx, obviously. So maybe just focus on the gantries for the first one, I would appreciate. Stephen MacMillan : Sure, Patrick. I think what we feel great about is over time, and we haven't built the market share in the installed base in the United States, and really around the world, but especially in the US without people really buying into the superiority of our products, from a labeling, from a workflow standpoint, from a clinical efficacy published data, everything else that we're doing to both detect earlier-stage cancers sooner, also reducing the false positives and avoiding needless callbacks. People have really seen that. So when it comes down to it of a hospital system, is looking to need a few new gantries for their system. They're not going to want to go away from us because they've made that decision to come into us. So they're much more willing to wait until we're back in business, plus the other reality is this is an across-the-board industry issue. So it's not like we are short and others can provide. So we really have two things going for us, which is call it, the micro, our products and the incredible products we're offering and the macro that what we're dealing with -- with the chip issue is being felt by everybody else. So I think our customers understand that. I think anybody who's in purchasing or works for a hospital, they all understand the supply chains and their own personalized, right? You need a dishwasher fixed and the parts taking months to get those kinds of things that are playing out in everybody's life. And I think everybody understands, okay, it's just going to be a little while. So we feel great about customers continuing to want our products and feeling better and better about our visibility into as we've been working with all the chip vendors right down to every single SKU and how many chips go into every one of our machines feeling better and better about where we'll go. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Karleen, maybe on the back of that, you mentioned in terms of the op margins, COVID going to be heavier in the first half, which is margin accretive. But at the same time, as we just talked through there with Steve, the Breast Health recovery is going to be more second half. That's been a drag on margins. So how should we think about the op margin cadence throughout the year? I know you talked about 30% for the year. But maybe just talk about how that rolls through given the moving pieces between COVID, Breast Health and some other things there? Thank you, guys. Karleen Oberton : Yes. I mean, I would think, the 30% is probably pretty consistent throughout the course of the year. As you said, the dynamics kind of change first half versus back half. So I think that 30%, if you're plus or minus in any quarter, a point or two, I think you're right on. Operator : And so we'll go to our next question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Tejas Savant : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Karleen, just following up on that margin question here a little bit. Can you just call out specifically in terms of the COVID contribution assumptions you're baking in here? Remind us of what the gross and operating margin assumptions are for that piece versus the rest of the business? Karleen Oberton : Yes, Tejas, why don't I just say that what we've noted in the prepared remarks is that COVID is accretive to the corporate averages, but we haven't disclosed it specifically. And I'd also add on that when you think about in this macro environment in our initial guide for the full year to say that our margins -- operating margins are going to be at 30%, which are pretty rich compared to the industry is pretty strong results, and we're really proud of that. And actually, even if you look at our net margins prior to pre-pandemic levels, which were around 20%, our guide would imply that they're roughly 22% to 23%, really reinforcing our earnings power. Tejas Savant : Got it. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up there in terms of the ranges you've baked into the guide, Karleen. Can you just walk us through what's assumed for the Breast Health recovery? At the high end of the guide, are you assuming essentially a return to normalcy by the fourth quarter or is there still some possibility of the recovery taking a little bit longer? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I think the guide would imply that we're approaching normalized levels as we exit the year. I would also say that part of the recovery, even if we did get incremental gantry chips than anticipated with the resource limitations as our field service engineers, who maintains the installed base also do the actual installs in any quarter. So, there will be a balance through this recovery, but I would, in general, think about a gradual sequential recovery throughout the course of the year and exiting close to normal levels. Tejas Savant : Got it Thank you. Karleen Oberton : Welcome. Operator : And we'll go to our next question from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group. Anthony Petrone : Thanks and congratulations on a strong finish to the year here and good to see at least some visibility into calendar 2023, just given the headwinds. I guess I'm going to start on COVID testing and just the guidance that was issued here and then a follow-up on broader diagnostics. The understanding that it's still tough to forecast pandemic ebbs and flows, but maybe perhaps one of the things that is sort of becoming evident here is the tender patterns whether it be from large lab entities or even governmental contracts.  And so when you think into 2023, is there any incremental visibility that you can point to as it relates to just larger tenders, whether it be US, OUS at the hospital level or at the government level? And then I'll have a follow-up on broader diagnostics. Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I wouldn't say we've got any more visibility. We've been very close to our customers all along, Anthony, in terms of both international from the Ministries of Health, deciding things right down to the regional parties within various countries and the same within every one of our customers in the US, both the main labs as well as the hospital. So, I think we continue to stay close and feel very good about our position and the way we continue to think about COVID is we're going to deliver whatever the marketplace needs, we're not going to get out of our skis in terms of forecasting it financially. Anthony Petrone : And then in terms of just a quick follow-up on COVID. I mean as we think of it as a consistent cash flow driver, if we even look ahead maybe beyond 2023, at what point do testing providers really look at this as a relatively consistent cash flow business that reliably again, is going to be a contributor going forward. So, just kind of the broader views on the consistency of COVID? And then lastly, diagnostics, when you think of testing intensity, a lot of new Panther users are -- how do you think that plays out just beyond the point we are here at the end of this fiscal year? Thanks again. Stephen MacMillan : Thanks Andy. We didn't fully hear the second part of that question because you were cutting in and out on the first part as it relates to the first part of the follow-up in terms of consistency on COVID, I think the way we've approached this all along has been you can't predict this has never been consistent. It has been volatile by region and by timeframe.  And any eight-week period, people have been way off probably trying to predict what was about to happen. So again, what we have said at the beginning, however, was we thought that this long term would create a new assay for us that would be far more enduring then, I think anybody ever thought it would be back in 2020 back to what people thought when everybody thought this was going to go away in a hurry or it was going to go away as soon as vaccines arrived or molecular testing was going to go away as soon as antigen tests came along, right? What we've learned is this thing is going to be around. And frankly, as long as countries like China are still trying the zero COVID approach, and everything else and the fact that this thing we always said in the beginning, this is a respiratory virus that will mutate. Herd immunity was never going to be achieved. And we thought we would end up with an enduring business.  Whether that enduring business ends up being $50 million, $100 million, $150 million, $200 million, we really don't know, but we feel really good that we're in that business. So thank you. Anthony Petrone : Thank you. I\u2019ll hop back in. Operator : And we'll go next to Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon. Well, I have a couple of questions on molecular testing before I go trick or treating. The first is on the COVID sales. So I think based on your disclosures, it sounds like the US assay sales were about $105 million, which was pretty stable sequentially. And I look at the government PCR data, volumes were down 27% quarter-over-quarter. So I was just curious on the COVID side, if you could talk about either share dynamics? Or was there any end of quarter ordering into the respiratory season? Any color on that would be great. Stephen MacMillan : Yeah. It's hard for us to fully know on the share stuff because of the various pieces. I would say there were no unusual ordering patterns at quarter end, so none of this was a stocking up for fourth quarter. We generally -- our business is very diversified. And I think one of the things we did, as you well know, early in the pandemic is we went out to a very broad customer base. And I think that has helped insulate and provide a little more enduring nature to our business. It's also helped our pricing hold up reasonably well. And so I think we feel pretty good. But we -- it just continues to go and regions and spikes and this and it does feel like US testing is settling in for the first time to a more normalized pattern and we're still -- we're starting to see that certainly in our own business, but no unusual spikes. Jack Meehan : Excellent. And then as my second question, so I appreciate the commentary about the new customers, the 85% running more than 1%, 55% more than 2%. Is there anything you can share on what are they running? Is this beyond respiratory testing? And I don't know if you have these stats handy, but how large is the virology business? If I look at the full year, how large is the vaginitis business? Any updates on those would be great. Karleen Oberton : Yeah. I think we stopped disclosing the actual number on that, but very strong growth year-over-year and that business continues to have a nice trajectory. I would say that it's diverse on the other assays, but probably leaning towards the core women's health assays primarily. Jack Meehan : Thank you, Karleen. Stephen MacMillan : Enjoy trick or treat. Jack Meehan : Appreciate it. Operator : And we'll move to our next question from Puneet Souda of SVB Securities. Puneet Souda : Yeah. Hi, Steve, Karleen. Thanks for taking the question. So just a bit on the longer term. I mean, you've talked about 5% to 7%. You're saying low double digits here. Obviously, businesses are recovering low capital expense, but more of recurring revenue that your customers are spending your way. So, just talk to us about how should we think about that? And is that now more of a conservative number? And just talk to us about how you're thinking about the 5% to 7% longer term? Stephen MacMillan : Yeah. I think long-term, we're sticking with the 5% to 7%. But as we've said all along, what, sometimes you're going to be above, sometimes it will be a little bit below. I think for where we are right now, we feel very good about delivering certainly above that for next year, but we don't want to get caught up way ahead of ourselves either and saying, we're moving that guidance up by any stretch. It's just as that reminder. There might be some periods of time where we're a little bit below that. There'll be periods we're above it. But I think we feel solidly about every one of our businesses. Karleen Oberton : We only gave that range about 15 months ago. So, I feel like we're not -- don't need to change it at this point. Puneet Souda : Okay, got it. And then Steve, a broader question for you. Now, in the sort of the post-pandemic era, and again, you might have a long tail to it, but do you see heightened utilization for flu, RSV, other respiratory just continuing on because of the awareness of just overall these viruses and overall, the significance of just overall diagnostics in routine primary care settings is such that it's going to be sustained. Just help us understand, do you see higher utilization just sustaining here for the respiratory businesses for a long time? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, it's a great question, Puneet, because I think we do see probably higher levels of testing going forth, right? The diagnostics industry has been elevated and people desire to know with more certainty what they have, even think about something as simple as RSV that we're talking about here in the last few weeks. I'd argue that 99.9% of the public have never heard of RSV even a month ago, right? So, now we're getting into these levels of granularity that people want to know more about and what they have. And we think that will be a positive. It's also both what we're able to offer on our Fusion platform, also a big piece that Mobidiag will bring to us in the future. And certainly, we're seeing that in our European business right now. So I think we're well poised also for the future. Operator : And we will move on to our next question from Liza Garcia of UBS. Liza Garcia : Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Appreciate it. Maybe to start off on Gyno Surgical and kind of expectations there with MyoSure kind of leading the growth for fiscal 2023. Can you kind of talk about what kind of gives you confidence. It seems like you have a little bit more optimism about kind of growth expectations for MyoSure, in particular. So I'd love to hear kind of what's driving the optimism and also kind of -- well, let's start there. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think with MyoSure, we just -- first off, we're biased because we just came back from our US sales meeting last week with that sales team. And it's hard not to be excited when you've been with them. But I think on a more serious and deeper basis, MyoSure has been an outsized grower now for seven or eight years, long beyond what anybody thought it could be. And I think what we continue to see is there's still significant opportunities in the fibroid space. There's still, to some degree, markets that are underdeveloped and MyoSure procedure is an amazingly positive procedure with great outcomes. And so, I think we just continue to -- we're not quite sure what the end market truly is there. Karleen Oberton : Yes. International continues to be a bigger piece of that performance as well, what gives us confidence in that outlook. Liza Garcia : Great. And then, can you just update us where you stand with the Biotheranostics CLIA lab going to San Diego headquarters and your automation and initiatives that you have underway and how we should think about time lines for those and maybe potential impact there? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, sure. The build-out of the lab in our building here in San Diego has gone well, that will be happening in the next couple of quarters, and we're adding more automation that will really be kicking in, in terms of particularly the ordering system really early next calendar year. So that team just continues to crush it since they've been part of the Hologic team. We were just with all of their salespeople last week and they're feeling so supportive and excited to be a part of Hologic. And its part of that classic thing of what we're trying to do is we bring these technologies in and are then able to put additional investment in them to accelerate the growth rates. What we've done with Bolder, what we're doing with Acessa, what we're doing with the Biotheranostics team and just feeling great about these opportunities. Operator : And we hear next from Max Masucci with Cowen and Company. Max Masucci : Hey, good afternoon. Congrats on a very strong year. First one, if we just think about the Panther install base, nearly doubling since pre-pandemic times, we have an expanding adoption of non-COVID menu items. Is there a logical range or a level where the non-COVID tamper asset gross margins have settled? Or maybe even in broader terms, how the go-forward Molecular Diagnostics gross margins have evolved since prepaid out at times? Karleen Oberton : Yes, I mean the gross margins for -- on the molecular business, we've said all along are accretive to the corporate average. But the dynamics of this business is, as we add more of the newer assays, we typically get those at a higher price, higher margin, but we give some pricing on the legacy assays. So, we'll get -- as we produce more in our San Diego facility, we'll obviously naturally gain more absorption. But I think about those holding at higher than corporate averages, but I wouldn't see a significant upward trend anytime in those. Max Masucci : Okay, got it. And then final one. A $2.3 billion in cash, historically low net leverage ratio, we're seeing recalibrating valuations in the public arena. So could you just give us a peek into the Hologic capital allocation playbook, should we assume that buybacks will remain the priority in a choppy market environment with opportunistic M&A sort of sitting in that number two slot in terms of prioritization? Karleen Oberton : Max, I would actually reverse that. So our capital allocation has consistently been to deploy our free cash flow, which, as you've noted, has grown over the last couple of years. But the priority is the M&A and share repurchase is more of an ongoing activity at a minimum to manage dilution from our equity plans as we see opportunities, disconnects to jump in and we'll get a little more. But priority will be M&A, but we'll be disciplined in that strategy. Stephen MacMillan : Yes, because Max, if I could build on that. Obviously, if you're looking in the last year, we didn't do as much on the M&A front. The previous year, we did a whole bunch. So sometimes the doctors don't look at any given couple of quarters to say that we've changed our strategy. It's really about the overlying opportunity. The other piece I would reiterate is, when you have a healthy base business, it's also given us the enormous ability to be very patient in doing deals. And I think that's the best part of it all is when your core business is healthy. There's no need to do deals and we can do the ones that make sense for us. So clearly, to reiterate, as Karleen said, number one is still on the acquisition front. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go to our next question from Tim Daley with Wells Fargo. Tim Daley : Great. Thanks for the time here. So, my first one is around the kind of broader macro environment. So, thinking about the guidance range here, is there any specific non-COVID drivers that you did layout for us that maybe put you guys at the high end of the guidance range or the low end? Or is COVID that kind of the big delta there? Stephen MacMillan : COVID is not. This is -- we're really talking about our base businesses being strong, all three of them. Tim Daley : Great. And then following up to that, are there any concerns that you have around the European geographical footprint, particularly relating to some of your third-party OEM partners? Just is that contemplated in guidance? Any additional details around that would be helpful. Stephen MacMillan : We certainly worry about the geopolitical and particularly the economic scenarios in Europe, and I think particularly as this winter comes in energy and everything else. I think having said that, that's all the macro. The micro is our teams and our businesses are just in great shape. And I think are poised regardless of the environment, to be able to power and deliver through that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you We'll move next to Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Derik de Bruin : Good evening. Hope you're doing well. Hey, how are you? So, two questions. First of all, the tax rate is going from 21% to 19%. So can you tell us what's driving that? And the second question is going to be, what are you assuming in pricing? I mean, how much of your sort of like double-digit organic revenue growth when you're looking at some of the targets or some of the businesses is sort of being driven by price? And are you diagnostic customers, in particular, starting to potentially push back on pricing as COVID reimbursement is likely to go away next year, the higher -- as a public health emergency goes away? Thanks. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So, certainly, on the tax rate, we continue to look for opportunities to more effectively leverage our supply chain and our operational footprint looking for our low-cost areas. And so a lot of that work has been happening over the last 24 months, which is driving that lower tax rate down to 19% for 2023. And I think from one aspect of COVID pricing, I think when the public health margin does go away, I do think the pricing will be certainly much more of a discussion with our customers than it has been. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. So, net Derik, we have very little pricing baked into the numbers. We have puts and takes, frankly, across franchises across geographies. And just to give a plug for Karleen because she's too modest. Everybody's always admired our operating margin piece, but she have been very focused on the net side, and our tax team has been working very hard over the last few years. So I think do a great, great job to really kind of show up this year with another opportunity for us to continue to drive that net margin. Derik de Bruin : And would you use 19% of the go-forward rate? Karleen Oberton : Yes. At this point, I would muster a change in the federal statutory rate, I think 19% is good to use. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Derik. Operator : And we'll go next to Casey Woodring with JPMorgan. Casey Woodring : Hi guys. Thanks for chipping me in. I guess just -- so last time we spoke; I think you guys were pointing to a pre-COVID operating margin of 31.5% from 2Q 2020. That is just a good place to start to 2023 as COVID would maybe balance out some of the supply chain headwinds in breast. So, curious just on the 30% number here, can you maybe quantify what the basis point headwind is from the supply chain dynamics on the year? And then maybe could you also quantify how much lower the international business operating margin is in relation to the total company's number? Thank you. Karleen Oberton : Yeah. So I think from the supply chain from the higher cost, it's roughly 200 to 250 basis points on the operating margin that we have forecast would persist through 2023. We have talked about international margins being lower than the US, but we have not disclosed the difference. But I think certainly, there is discussions, our teams are focused on improving their leverage as we move forward. Operator : And thank you, everyone. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. And this now concludes Hologic's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Have a good evening.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Justin, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations to begin the call. Ryan Simon : Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon and thank you for joining Hologic's first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. With me today are Steve McMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them, as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are : one, organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue excluding the divested Blood Screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year. And two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued product in Diagnostics. Finally, any percentage change we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Our results highlight the strength of our three divisions, the power of our commercial channels and the increasing impact of our transformative growth drivers from R&D and acquisitions. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.07 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.07, both above the high end of our guidance. We also repurchased 1.5 million shares of our stock for $100 million in the quarter. To recap our pre-release, while we did have the benefit of three extra selling days, our top line performance was strong. Diagnostics grew 15.8%, powered by molecular diagnostics, which grew 24.5%. Both figures are organic and exclude COVID. Surgical also delivered an impressive quarter, growing 14.7% organically. And Breast Health finished the quarter down only 5.2%, a signal that our recovery from chip-related supply chain headwinds is indeed underway. While the extra days contributed approximately 250 basis points of growth net, even without the extra days, Diagnostics and Surgical both grew double digits and Breast Health exceeded prior guidance. All in, we are well positioned to achieve our full year guidance of low double-digit organic growth ex-COVID in all three of our franchises, well above our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. Our balance sheet and cash flow are exceptionally strong and we continue to create value for our stakeholders. Today, we'd like to cover two main topics. First, we'll build on the thesis from our JPMorgan presentation three weeks ago, a theme that encapsulates how we improve women's health globally, drive our commercial success and elevate Hologic's reputation at the same time. Second, we'll highlight the transformation of our business and showcase the growth we are driving in each division, which we hope is now becoming much more evident in recent quarters. We are incredibly excited about today and confident about our future. Jumping right in, purpose driven, results driven. These four words comprise the theme of our JPMorgan presentation this year and these four words underpin the success of our entire business. At Hologic, we have an unparalleled commitment to women's health. When we speak purpose driven, results driven, nothing symbolizes these words better than our virtuous circle, which we feature in our corporate presentation. It is simple and powerful at the same time. Most importantly, it unifies and inspires our thousands of employees around the world and points our talented workforce in one singular direction, to elevate women's health, where we have leadership positions in each segment in which we operate. Our business starts with innovative, clinically differentiated, life changing, lifesaving technologies. Whether through R&D or by M&A, it all starts with innovation. As we bring these new innovative products to market, they grow our sales and profits. And here is the key to our success. What we believe sets us apart and allows us to thrive, we then invest these profits into championing women's health on a global scale. We are expanding policy and access, which then allows our products to reach more women and have an even greater impact on the world. And as our business grows, this cycle continues, simple and powerful. Two weeks ago for the second straight year, we had the opportunity to engage with global leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. This is an incredible platform that was not available to us just three years ago. We've earned our access through our leadership in women's health, our pioneering Hologic Global Women's Health Index and our outstanding response to COVID that continues today. As we've grown our business, we have significantly elevated the Hologic brand around the world. With our engagement at Davos, making powerful connections and building strong relationships, combined with recognition from our global partnership with the Women's Tennis Association. Hologic and what we stand for is more recognized globally than ever before, which in turn helps us attract the best and the brightest to the Hologic team, an important advantage in today's labor market. Quite frankly, the best thing we can do for the world and also for our business is to raise awareness and opportunities for women's health globally. For a sense of scale, there are approximately 170 million women in the U.S., our largest market. This is only a fraction of the nearly 4 billion women in the world. We have a long way to go. And as the importance of women's health is elevated and these markets grow, Hologic will be there at each step along the way. Shifting gears to our second topic, understanding the growth that is driving our business. With our strong performance for the quarter, the number one question we are asked is, how are we growing our top line? To answer this question, we will first reflect on our business transformation, a powerful mix of organic innovation, and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. Second, we will discuss each division and highlight examples of our growth engines and the multitude of market strategies deployed across each division. Reflecting on our transformation, it really started well before COVID. Three years ago, we were ready to show the world how we had diligently and thoughtfully strengthened our business for growth. Then, the pandemic hit. And when it did, we established three goals. One, take care of our employees, which we have done; two, meet the world's needs for highly accurate molecular diagnostic COVID testing, which we continue today; and three, emerge as a fundamentally stronger company, which is happening now. Under the cloud of COVID, while successfully deploying Panthers and producing our COVID assays, we strengthened Hologic for the long-term, to a level higher than even we had imagined prior to the pandemic. We achieved this through the combination of innovative internal R&D efforts, plus a series of tuck-in acquisitions. As a result, we've had continuous new product releases that have fundamentally transformed our business and boosted our growth profile. Now as the COVID cloud begins to clear, it is increasingly more evident that we are geared for success, geared for growth and geared to sustained performance over the long-term. Next, to fully appreciate our growth potential is to understand the transformation and diversification of our portfolio and growth strategies. Across all divisions, we are innovating, acquiring and building new markets, entering underdeveloped markets and penetrating existing segments. All while continuing to defend and even grow share in the markets we lead. Our growth in each division is grounded in strong and durable core products. These resilient core franchises are backed by long established clinical needs and commercial relationships, which provide a rock solid foundation to leverage into our newer growth drivers. We leverage our installed bases and customer relationships to advance our newer products, which we expect to both diversify the portfolio and accelerate growth. Moving on to the divisions. In Diagnostics, we have leading positions in core women's health product lines, such as STIs, and cervical cancer. Our women's health molecular diagnostics and psychology base drives steady growth and supports positive relationships with top laboratories and key opinion leaders, which opens the door for additional new products. Today, Diagnostics has grown from primarily a US women's health business to a global diagnostic franchise with many more growth drivers. For example, we now have over 3,250 Panthers worldwide. A number beyond what we had even imagined, along with 19 assays and the Fusion system that enables even further menu expansion. We also have a vastly expanded footprint with three acquisitions : Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Mobidiag that are contributing today and will even more so in the future. More specifically, driving future growth for Diagnostics means leveraging our expanded Panther installed base. These customers are adopters of our newer assays, including BV/CV/TV, and M.gen. We add menu, promote guidelines and drive adoption through our women's health clinical channel. Likewise, we also leverage our Panther installed base to enter established categories such as virology, and respiratory testing. Focusing on our Diagnostics acquisitions, with Biotheranostics we are already seeing solid contributions as we build a new market that is currently minimally penetrated. And with Mobidiag, the Mobidiag platform allows for significant future contributions as we prepare to enter the large and emerging syndromic panel market that is adjacent to our core molecular diagnostics franchise. In Breast Health, revenue from our 3D Mammography equipment and related service represents the core revenue foundation of the division. While our fiscal 2023 growth is primarily driven by the return of chip supply and gantry availability. The division is primed for future growth via a further portfolio expansion. The Breast Health business now spans the Breast Continuum of Care with more recurring growth drivers than ever before. We have expanded from what was once a capital intensive business by growing service revenue and adding more recurring disposable revenue. In doing so, we are creating new markets as with our Brevera breast biopsy system, while also entering existing markets where we compete with clinically differentiated products. And while we are leaders in the screening space, our R&D teams are poised to keep us ahead of the pack. In surgical, the business has changed dramatically, evolving from essentially a two product division, to one which is now much more robust and diverse. Last quarter, revenue outside of NovaSure and core MyoSure represented approximately 25% of the division's total compared to only approximately 10% in fiscal 2019. While NovaSure and core MyoSure still formed a strong durable base of the division, the business is far more dynamic than pre-pandemic. We now have meaningful growth drivers outside of these two core product lines from acquisitions, new in-house products and also improvements to existing products. Going a level deeper, the growth in surgical is driven by products like Fluent as well as NovaSure V5, both from our internal R&D efforts. With Fluent, we created an elegant solution to hysteroscopic fluid management that stands alone. And with our NovaSure V5 line extension, we have proven that even the best can get better and that we are never satisfied and never done innovating. By acquisition, the assessor procedure and the bolder advanced vessel sealing portfolio also diversify and elevate the division's growth trajectory. These are both laparoscopic tools that we've moved swiftly to acquire during COVID times and have added to our prior hysteroscopic only offering. Acessa is a unique radio frequency fibroid removal solution where we are building a new market and improving payer coverage. In Boulder, we are entering an underdeveloped market by deploying our large surgical sales force to introduce our advanced sealing portfolio to the OB/GYN market. Finally, our international business is so much stronger and poised for exceptional future growth post pandemic. Bolstering the individual product growth drivers in each division, we continue to penetrate our markets internationally. For example, in the quarter our Diagnostics business ex-COVID and surgical businesses each grew more than 20%. As we've stated before, we expect international growth rates to be accretive to our overall growth rate for years to come. In summary, our commitment to our purpose has paved the way for our success during the pandemic and is a beacon for our future. We are now a transformed, much stronger Hologic with more diverse growth drivers across each business and a much larger, more capable international presence. And through our innovative R&D and effective tuck in acquisition strategy, we are well positioned to continue to drive strong sustainable growth for years to come. With that, let me turn the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to share first quarter results that exceeded our guidance on both the top line and bottom line. Our strong performance was once again driven by our diagnostics and surgical businesses with each growing mid-teens organically in the period, excluding COVID-19 revenue. And in Breast Health, we are encouraged by results that show the chip supplies moving in the right direction and that our mammography business is recovering. Before moving into our divisional results, it is important to highlight our balance sheet. Our leverage ratio of 0.2 times shows the capital structure that is strong as it has ever been, providing our business a tremendous amount of flexibility for internal investment and capital deployment opportunities. Moving on, I will now provide more color on our financial results. In the first quarter, revenue and profitability once again meaningfully surpassed our estimates, with the balance sheet split between our base business and COVID. Total revenue came in at $1.074 billion, a result more than $100 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance. And non GAAP EPS was $1.07, more than $0.20 higher than the midpoint of our prior guide. Turning to our business results. In Diagnostics, total revenue of $559.3 million declined 41.2% compared to the prior year. It is important to remember that COVID testing revenue was elevated in our fiscal first quarter of 2022 given the surge in infections from the Omicron variant. Thus, a more accurate representation of the diagnostics business is to exclude COVID assay revenue, related ancillaries and a small amount of revenue from discontinued products. When making this normalization, we see that organic diagnostics revenue increased 15.8% in the quarter. Within Diagnostics, we continue to see momentum in molecular. For the third quarter in a row, we delivered healthy double digit growth. Specifically, molecular diagnostics grew nearly 25% in our first quarter excluding the impact of COVID. This outstanding result demonstrates strong utilization across our significantly larger Panther installed base. Performance was driven by a mix of our legacy portfolio and newer assays. For example, the collective revenue of our core STI menu was well above pre pandemic levels in the quarter. In addition, BV/CV/TV had another strong quarter, more than doubling compared to the prior year as our progress continues growing the IVD vaginitis market. Further, our non COVID respiratory portfolio delivered revenue ahead of expectations in the period. As we saw uptake and testing for flu and RSV given heightened prevalence in public awareness of these pathogens. Finally, the Biotheranostics contribution to our base molecular performance continues to increase with accretive revenue growth in the quarter. Moving to our COVID results, we generated $127 million of COVID assay revenue in the quarter, exceeding our previous guidance of $75 million. In terms of the COVID assay revenue split by geography, domestic sales led most of our upside and represented nearly 80% of COVID assay revenue in the period. The demand for our COVID assay remains primarily COVID only. However, we did see above trend demand for our COVID flu multiplex test. Rounding out Diagnostics, our Cytology and Perinatal businesses increased 1.6% compared to the prior year. In Brest Health, total revenue of $334.2 million was down 5.2%, better than expected. These results were driven by strong demand for our Mammography equipment and improving semiconductor chip supply. We remain cautiously optimistic that Q1 revenue performance in our breast imaging segment being down only 4.5% highlights that the worst of the chip supply headwinds are likely behind us. We would remind everyone, we are still on allocation and that the macro backdrop could change quickly. As it relates to our interventional business, revenue was down 8% in the period, driven by lingering supply chain issues outside of chip availability. We expect these headwinds to subside for the balance of the year and the segment to resume a cadence of strong growth starting in fiscal Q2. In surgical, first quarter revenue of $154.1 million grew more than 17%. And excluding the Boulder acquisition, the business grew nearly 15%. These results underscore a more diverse surgical business with more growth drivers than in the past. In addition to strong performance from MyoSure and better than expected results from NovaSure, the quarter showcased increasing contributions from Fluent and our laparoscopic portfolio of Asessa and Boulder. Lastly, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $26.6 million increased slightly, less than 1% compared to the prior year period. Now let's move on to the rest of the non GAAP P&L for the first quarter. Gross margin of 62.7% was driven by higher than expected COVID-19 testing revenues and strong performance in our base business in the period. Total operating expenses of $339.4 million in the first quarter increased 1.6%, but were up less than 1% when excluding expenses from Boulder, which closed at the end of November 2021. The increase was led by higher marketing spend given the timing of certain initiatives. We expect marketing expense to move lower starting in our fiscal second quarter of 2023. Below operating income other expense was less than anticipated primarily due to higher interest income from investing our elevated cash balances at higher interest rates. Finally, our tax rate in Q1 was 19% as expected. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q1 came in at 31.1% and net margin was 24.9%, both ahead of our previous estimates. Non GAAP net income finished at $267.9 million and non GAAP EPS was $1.07. Moving on from the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $253.4 million in the first quarter. We had $2.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage ratio remained at 0.2 times. Although it may appear to the outside our eye that we are letting our cash balance build, rest assured, our M&A teams in each division are incredibly active. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. Our first priority remains pursuing growth accretive tuck in deals that align with our divisions and leverage our core strengths and strong commercial channels. More recently, given the stability of our balance sheet and the strength of our business, we have widened our aperture to consider slightly larger EBITDA of generating deals. That said, it is important to make clear that we expect any transaction we pursue will be complementary to our core strengths and not represent a completely new or unrelated vertical. Our second priority will continue to be share repurchases. And as Steve highlighted, in the first quarter we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $100 million. Now let's move on to our updated non GAAP financial guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2023. As a reminder, our organic guidance excludes acquisition revenue until each deal annualizes. Therefore, all deals are part of our organic base starting in Q2, 2023. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we again expect strong financial results with total revenue in the range of $930 million to $980 million. For all of fiscal 2023, we are increasing our full year guidance and expect total revenue in the range of $3.85 billion to $4 billion, reflecting low double digit organic growth ex-COVID across each of our divisions. To help with constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign currency exchange headwinds of slightly less than $20 million in the second quarter of 2023 and approximately $50 million for the full year. These headwinds have improved compared to our previous guidance as the U.S. dollar has depreciated over the past several months. Turning to our divisions, we are thrilled with the outlook for each business as we continue to anticipate that core diagnostics excluding COVID, Breast Health and Surgical will organically grow low double digits for our fiscal 2023. In diagnostics, molecular should continue to lead the way. We expect our assays to drive growth as non COVID utilization improves and customers add additional menu to their Panther system. As a reminder, our molecular diagnostic growth is not predicated on placing more Panther instruments, but rather helping our existing customers grow their business. As we have said consistently, even though Panther placements are likely to slow in the near term, given the huge pull forward during the pandemic, additional placements do not influence the trajectory of our molecular outlook. Closing out on diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of slightly less than $25 million for the year. Moving to Breast Health, we see an improving environment for chip supply and our position is unchanged from last quarter. Our expectation is that for a gradual improvement in our breast imaging business throughout 2023. We maintain our view that the business should exit fiscal 2023 at or near normal level. However, we'd like to make clear that you should not expect an outsized revenue catch up in any particular quarter. Instead, our plan is to incrementally work down our backlog over time as we look to efficiently manage the resources of our outstanding field service team. Finally in surgical, as evidenced by our first quarter's results, the business has quietly transformed into a dynamic franchise, moving beyond what was once a two product division. Low double digit organic growth for fiscal 2023 will be driven by a combination of MyoSure, the related FluentFluid Management System and our laparoscopic portfolio of Acessa and Boulder. In terms of COVID sales, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $50 million in the second quarter of 2023 and $225 million for the full year. COVID related items inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be approximately $35 million in the second quarter and $130 million for the full year. Moving down the P&L. For the full year, we continue to expect our non GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the low 60s and our non GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Within this operating margin profile, we have again incorporated elevated inflationary pressures into our guidance of approximately 200 basis points to 250 basis points, which we anticipate will persist throughout our fiscal 2023. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to step down starting in our second quarter, given the timing of marketing expenses primarily associated with our WTA partnership. Further, we foresee operating expense dollars as fairly flat sequentially from Q2 through Q4. Below operating income, we expect other income net to be an expense of around $50 million for the rest of the year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $25 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected non GAAP EPS of $0.80 to $0.90 in the second quarter and $3.55 to $3.85 for the year. To conclude, let me wrap up by repeating that our strong first quarter results exceeded our guidance despite a persistent macro uncertain. Performance was driven by tremendous growth in our molecular diagnostics and surgical businesses. Combined with a better than expected progress in Breast Health. As we look forward to the remainder of our fiscal 2023, we are excited to showcase our transformed business. With our updated guidance reinforcing our expectations of low double digit growth in each division for the remainder of the year. Hologic is a much stronger company than prior to the pandemic and we believe our 2023 performance will further prove this out. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Karleen, maybe just picking up on the margin side there, obviously, pretty good performance in the quarter. Still talking about, obviously, some of the headwinds throughout the year. Can you just talk about the cadence? I know previously you were talking kind of 30% -ish every quarter. Can you just walk us through, I guess, obviously, the tailwinds we saw in 1Q and what the rest of the year looks like in terms of headwinds versus tailwinds and how that cadence works? Karleen Oberton : Yes, sure. So I think the outlook would say that each quarter is roughly 30% operating margin and what you see happening is, you have the marketing expenses coming down from Q1. You have lower COVID revenue, which is a headwind, but then you have higher Breast Health revenue, which is a tailwind. So they kind of offset those headwinds or the tailwinds offset over the course of the year. And we maintain at that 30%, again, a little lower than pre-pandemic, because we have the higher inflationary costs still anticipated. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. It's understood. And then Steve, maybe just on molecular diagnostics, really strong core performance there. Can you just flush out a little bit more on the drivers you saw? I guess, sustainability, again, obviously, some pretty big numbers you guys have put up there. Just trying to get a sense for the drivers and what we could expect going forward on that front? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. You probably got it in multiple buckets, Patrick. Part is just a return of the Panther is being used for the core STI, most of our women's health business. You've got increasing growth in our new product launches, especially BV/CV, which is off to a tremendous start and we said we think will be a major driver of growth. And you really have -- what we kept saying over the last couple of years and it wasn't as obvious is so many of our customers around the world that we're running COVID are now putting the menu onto the Panthers. And it's really that simple and a huge part of it. And there's just a little bit of Africa and some viral stuff. But... Karleen Oberton : Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Patrick, because we had some nice contribution from our respiratory assays, which will be seasonal as we move forward. Operator : And our next question will come from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Hi. You're going to get the formalities out of the way, go birds. It feels like [indiscernible], but I say that every year. Stephen MacMillan : Fly Eagle fly, fly Hologic fly. Okay, go ahead, Jack. Jack Meehan : Excellent. So I had a couple of 10-Q derived questions that I personally thought were kind of interesting and I want to get your thoughts on. The first is, so you report international molecular sales of $97 million. Karleen, based on your COVID assay disclosures, I think it's like $25 million of international COVID. So it implies about $72 million of base molecular international. Prior to the pandemic, it was like $30 million a quarter. So I was just wondering like could this be an interesting gauge of what the international installed base could look like in terms of the stickiness of Panther? Just any thoughts on that would be helpful. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So we have, as you said, that number includes the COVID assay revenues. So I think you've attempted to take some of that up. We also have the ancillaries, which are part of that, that are elevated because of COVID. But I think certainly, we're seeing the uptake, again, with newer customers in more than COVID. As well as our initiatives like in Africa, what Steve talked about the viral picking up some nice traction there as well. I think we -- as we think about international molecular, we would think that that is going to grow a little faster than U.S. given the commercial investments that we've made there and the Panther placements. Stephen MacMillan : Yes, Jack, just to interpolate on that point that you've noticed. We placed a lot of Panthers with so many, especially in the European countries as we responded with COVID and every one of those was coming with trailing shift over to the STI business. So I think that's a big piece of it. Jack Meehan : Interesting. Okay. Then my second question is on breast imaging. So the U.S. sales in the quarter were $212 million. I think that's actually like the largest first quarter you've had, at least several years. International still seeing some pressure, but I'm just trying to juxtapose this versus your comment about you're still seeing ongoing semiconductor pressure. What was going on in the U.S. in the quarter? Was there any flush of some sort as chips came in and just what does 2Q assume? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, there was absolutely no flush we can tell you. We did get a little bit more supply that we we\u2019re able to install. And candidly, Jack, we had the extra week. We got a little bit of service revenue in there, because of that extra week in the quarter. So that kind of pushed us into the growth without that extra week that would have been slightly down a bit. But we like where we're coming and we were able to kind of refurb a few more chips, got a few more chips in and we're able to get a little more product out, but we're feeling really good about where we're headed this quarter and for the rest of the year in Breast Health. Operator : And our next question will come from Max Masucci with Cowen & Company. Max Masucci : Great. Thanks for taking the question. First one on operating margins. So it looks like the COVID testing and related items were about 15% of the organic revenues. So just based on your expectations for global COVID testing revenues this year and as we near the end of the U.S. government's DAG program, does COVID testing and reimbursement remain the big needle mover for 2023 operating margins? Or is the operating margin expansion opportunity now more dependent on the Breast Health rebounds and/or continued strength in non COVID molecular DX? Karleen Oberton : Yes, I would say that the margin accretion from COVID is less and less dependent on COVID as we move throughout the year and it's going to be more driven by the Breast Health recovery and certainly Q1 to Q2 lower operating expenses, which will persist throughout the year. Max Masucci : Okay. Got it. And then just in terms of M&A, I think if you look at your free cash flow deployment, about 28% over the past five years. I think it's been for share buybacks in any sense? I would just be curious to hear about the potential size of any M&A deal you'd be willing to pursue. Any recent conversations amongst the biz dev team in terms of what types of companies fit best with the Hologic of today? And just a general update on capital deployment would be great? Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Sure, Max. To reiterate what Karleen said, our primary goal is still tuck in acquisitions followed by share buybacks. We certainly have been opportunistic on the buybacks because we generated a whole bunch of more cash during that time and thought that made a lot sense. Going forward, we're looking across the businesses, all being led by the divisions. We're not going to get into particular scale or targets for obvious reasons. But I think what we would say is, we might go a little bit bigger on scale if it brought more EBITDA. So it will be a proportionate thought process there. But I think we're -- the biggest takeaway frankly is, we're in a position of strength where our base businesses are very strong. We don't have to go do anything. And candidly, when I think there's a lot of folks around trying to figure out what they want to be when they grow up right now. We know exactly where we're going and what we want to be and that is championing women's health and having every business going well. So it gives us the luxury of being patient and smart on the business development front. Operator : And our next question will come from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Puneet Souda : Yes. Hi, Steve. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe for you, given the low double digit growth rate that you're highlighting here, obviously, the business, all three segments are doing great. So what's holding you back on the long term guide of 5% to 7%? Why couldn't that be higher now in your long term outlook? Stephen MacMillan : Because we're running the business for the long term. And fundamentally, let's look at it. We're still bouncing off of some comps from last year where things were a little depressed from COVID everything else. We are a company that delivers and plans for the long haul and everything we've done to move up to the 5% to 7% has been very smart and we're going to continue to be prudent. Puneet Souda : Okay, great. And then just on capital deployment, maybe Karleen. What's your ability to lever up? What ratio are you comfortable with, just given the sort of the interest rates that are there right now and potential for those to continue to ramp up a bit higher? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I mean, I think we have indicated that we'd be comfortable in a 2 times to 3 times leverage ratio that's something we talked to and supported by our credit agency. But to your point, we would continue to evaluate based on interest rate environment. But certainly, at this point we have plenty of cash and we have a credit line that we can fully deploy. So we feel like we've got good flexibility to do what we want in that event. Operator : And moving on to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Congratulations on a solid Q here, and thanks for taking my question. Steve, I wanted to ask one on this guidance update here. It looks like you beat the quarter versus your midpoint of your prior guidance by about $120 million, the annual guide was raised by about $125 million. It looks like most of that's coming from FX and change in code assumptions. When I look at Q1 print here, your underlying organic came in better. So why wouldn't some of that underlying strength we saw in Q1 flow through -- flows through the rest of the year? Is there any kinding impact of revenue recognition or is this just a conservatism? Stephen MacMillan : It's -- we continue to deliver, I can promise you, it has nothing to do with timing of revenue recognition, Vijay. The underlying business is very strong, we\u2019re one quarter in. Think about where we were a year ago at this time. Suddenly Russia invaded Ukraine, nobody saw that coming. I've lived through the downturn of 2008-2009. We've watched the world go up and down and over the first quarter of the year. So we're going to continue to be very prudent, do not underestimate our confidence in our ability to run the business. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And then maybe another way to ask this question Steve is Diagnostic. Clearly it was a highlight, 16% and organic. So what is driving this? Is this like reagents? What kind of testing is driving this? Or was this easy code comp? When I look at Q1, overall underlying organic was 6%, they hit double digits for the year, the base has to do clean stroke at the back half. How should we think about this diagnostic which was 15% in Q1 ramping up in back half or is the back half being carried by normalization of breast imaging revenues? Stephen MacMillan : Look, clearly the comps on molecular and diagnostics will get harder in the back half. But fundamentally, what's driving it, we sort of answered this I think earlier. We placed a whole bunch of Panthers, almost 1,500 Panthers in COVID time over the last three years. We've got more customers adopting our core menu. We have our new products being launched doing very well. And those are really the main drivers, as well as a little bit of flu and a little bit of viral stuff as we've been penetrating a little more Africa. Karleen Oberton : Yes. I mean, I think it is the Panther placements and new customers as well. I think we've talked about in our corporate presentation that of newly acquired customers, 85% are running at least one other assay and over 55% are running at least two other assays. So I think that is the value of the Panther in the menu that we have driving that growth. Operator : And our next question will come from Tim Daley with Wells Fargo. Tim Daley : Great. So Steve, I love the comments on some parties out there trying to figure out who they want to be when they grow up. And just running with that, we've seen a lot of players in molecular diagnostics seem to be adding menu in women's health arena. So given your legacy foothold there, how can you think about the current competitive environment? Are you worried about any price pressures, maybe from new entrants trying to gain share via that lever? Yes, just kind of the sensible stance here and kind of what you would answer as to any questions around that? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, we worry all the time. But at the end of the day, we've also built an incredible sales force that has partnered both with the labs, but also with the clinicians. And our assays have proven themselves over time as well as do not underestimate the workflow advantages of our Panther system. And so, there's a lot of people that can talk a good game and especially let's face it. There were so many startups that all were working on stuff and then they got money in COVID time and they start talking about all their women's health assays. And it's an interesting little landscape right now. So we never take anybody for granted. We face some very formidable competitors, but we always have and we will continue to and we frankly think we continue to innovate things like BB/CV. We continue to bring new assays and new tests and new education to our customers. And that continues to provide strength for us. Tim Daley : All right. And I appreciate that. And then one for Karleen. So Surgical, great to hear about the performance outside of the legacy products and appreciate the detail on the growth drivers this year. But could you kind of give us a bit more quantified detail about growth ranges here across the various buckets, so kind of the legacy products versus the new in house developed versus kind of the recent acquisitions, any additional kind of above below ranges or anything like that you could provide? And thank you. Karleen Oberton : Yes. What I would say is dollar contribution is probably evenly split between the legacy platform and affluent our new innovative and then the acquisitions. But certainly, the percentage growth rate is much higher than the acquisitions building off a smaller base. But at the end of the day, I think the key takeaway is, there's not just one growth driver, there's multiple growth drivers that are driving the success of that business. Operator : And our next question will come from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Tejas Savant : Hey, guys. Good evening and thanks for the time here. Maybe I'll start with a couple on some of the recent deals for you, Steve. On Mobidiag, can you just remind us again where things stand in terms of -- I think you had said there's an entry buildup underway ahead of the launch. How big do you think the revenue opportunity could be in fiscal 2023? And then similarly, you highlighted Biotheranostics a couple of times today and obviously, they've got into guidelines. They have the recent data from December as well. How big do you see this opportunity becoming for you, perhaps not this year, but a couple of years out? Stephen MacMillan : Sure. I think on Mobi, Mobi will still be pretty small this year. Mobi will hit its stride ultimately when bring it to the U.S. which is still several years away. But we love the platform we have there. On Biotheranostics, it's still very small penetration. So the reality is, clearly, it's going to be probably potentially a few hundred million, we're not sure at this point, never great at. When you're creating new markets, it's always really hard because when you go back eight years ago, people ask me, could MyoSure someday be the size of NovaSure. And at that point in time, it was hard to picture that. And today, MyoSure is way bigger than NovaSure. So I think this magic that we have where we really are creating and building markets, it's sometimes hard to fully put a number on it other than to see, we think there's a lot of runway here, a lot. Tejas Savant : Got it. That's helpful. And then a couple of follow-ups here. One on, just the hospital CapEx environment and any sort of change in either sort of decision timelines or perhaps cancellation rates here a month into the new calendar year? And China, I know it's small for you guys. I think it's less than 3% of sales. But is there anything going on there in terms of the COVID case surge that we should be factoring in at least in the fiscal second quarter here? Stephen MacMillan : I think on the -- first on CapEx, we continue to stay really close to our sales teams on it. And seeing very tiny, nothing outside of historical cancellation rates, which is de minimis. On China, I think what you will see is, probably most of the hospitals in China over the last 60-ish days and probably here for a little period four are probably cutting down on normal procedures as they've been treating the COVID patients. But I think for our business, again, pretty small, but I think that's the kind of macro way I'd be thinking about China right now. And my hunch is, after the Chinese New Year and everything else, they're going to largely come back online and that will start to pick back up probably later this actual calendar quarter. I think they're going to get through it fine. Operator : And moving on to Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Derik de Bruin : Hi, good afternoon. Stephen MacMillan : Hey, Derek. Derik de Bruin : Hey. A question, you're talking about 30-ish percent adjusted operating margin for this year. I'm looking at the consensus for 2024, it's about 30.5%. You're talking about 200 basis point to 250 basis points of inflationary pressures that are sort of in there. So like can you walk us through how you're thinking about operating margins as you sort of invest in the business and some of these inflationary pressures normalize, just sort of trying to get a sense of where we go from here? Karleen Oberton : Yes, Derek, it's Karleen. So I'll take this one. So if you think about prior to the pandemic, what I would say is, our normal operating margin was roughly 30%, 31.5%, very rich margins for our industry. I see us probably over time getting back to that level. But what I would say is, think about our 5% to 7% top line long term growth rate. We will grow EPS faster than that, so likely low double digits and that EPS growth comes from more than just operating margin expansion. It comes from higher revenue growth, as well as some things that we can do below the line. So that's how we think about our long term outlook for earnings growing faster than revenue and again anchored on that 5% to 7%. Stephen MacMillan : And Derek, I\u2019ll put a little point on it too. I've been around this business long enough to watch either divisions or big companies or companies themselves trying to push that operating margin so far that they cut into R&D and you don't see it immediately, but over time your innovation falls. And so, we know a lot of folks want to just keep saying all -- every number go up like that. We're thinking very much as Karleen said about driving the EPS number, but continuing to invest in R&D and not try to drive the operating margin as high as humanly possible. Derik de Bruin : Well, thanks for setting me up Steve. That's exactly where I was going next. So I appreciate that. When you think -- you've got Biotheranostics, which is your entry in sort of like the oncology world. I mean there were some dabbling in the past with some things with like -- I think with PCA3 or some of this like stuff. How do you sort of think about oncology market? I mean there's obviously a lot of real estate out there, but I think pointed out that you don't want to do anything that's super dilutive in those areas. Can you just sort of -- but clearly there's a lot that's going on that market and opportunities for Hologic. Can you sort of like flesh out where you sort of think your genomics focus is, where this is going, how it is? Thanks. Karleen Oberton : Sure, Derik. You're probably the only person who remembers PCA3. So I think we're comfortable continuing to be fairly patient. If I look at this overall, right? So I go back seven or eight years, liquid biopsy, it's going to be the greatest thing ever and everybody thought by 2018, 2020 this massive thing, we kept saying, look, we just don't know that there's going to be a lot of money made. So we continue and particularly in our acquisitions, everything we look at is thinking about what is the long term value creation from an earnings standpoint, not just a revenue and let's face it. As you well know in this industry as well there's a whole bunch of companies that generate a lot of top line, but no bottom line and they get great valuations when they're standalones. You try to drop those into a healthy company and where suddenly the EPS starts to get looked at, you never get that same expansion on the multiple. So I also think for all of the promise, the promise never comes as quickly as everybody thinks it's going to do. I'm still waiting for gain sharing in orthopedics to take over the full world 20 years later. And I just think as we continue to watch the space, we believe there will be winners that will emerge, but we're still letting some of those play out candidly and try to see it's not just a revenue gain or a number of boxes sold or a number of kits sold or whatever else. It really is, okay, what's our long term trajectory is how we're trying to think about these things? Thank you for asking that. Operator : And we will take a question from Andrew Brackmann with William Blair. Dustin Scaringe : Hey, this is Dustin on the line for Andrew. Going back to a comment you made earlier on Mobidiag and the entry in the roaming testing market. Can you be more specific on the timelines and how you plan to leverage your tampered relationships to drive that forward? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. We're clearly entering in Europe right now on a smaller scale. The U.S. clearance will be ultimately the bigger part. And as we said, that's probably at least a 2025-ish event at this point. So we're still a few years away as we prepare for it. And we'll certainly be able to leverage a lot of the strength that we have in the labs, especially the medium sized labs as we go into that point at that point. Dustin Scaringe : Okay. And I recognize that you talked a lot about M&A already, but I\u2019m wondering if you can be more specific and speak to how you're thinking about valuations both in the public and private space? Stephen MacMillan : We're always looking -- at the end of the day, we're thinking about the long term top and bottom line growth. We're very focused on ROIC, a key part of our senior leadership team comp is tied on ROIC, so we look at it on every deal. And we've watched a whole bunch of things that even if come down 80% or 90% and some of them we still don't necessarily like. So again, I think we've got the luxury of time on our side given the strength of underlying business and the strength of our balance sheet, which gives us the chance to be relatively picky around what might be out there. Operator : And we have a question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas Exane. Navann Ty : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. On women's health, so I believe vaginitis drove Q1 growth ex-COVID. Should it continue to drive growth for the rest of the year? And longer term, could you discuss your women's health focus being potentially a competitive advantage versus your non focused peers? Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think we continue to see growth certainly in our women's health assays that's been -- and it kind of got me to your second point of view. If you think about something like BB/CV/TV that we've launched, we discovered and realized about that because we're so tapped into to the key opinion leaders and starting to realize that there are other tests that may be able to be developed that we can bring to the market to bring greater levels of certainty and specificity. And I think when we have that knowledge because we surround those customers, our focused approach certainly benefits as well and I think helps us on the innovation side, the same in 3D mammography and how that's led to better biopsy stuff. And then the same in our surgical business where understanding fibroids better than anybody else and being able to innovate endometrial ablation. So we kind of surround these, call them, large niches, but it's really the insights that we have more with the KOLs that I think does provide us a level of competitive advantage. Thank you. Navann Ty : Thanks. And staying at women's health, you mentioned future portfolio expansion in Breast Health. So are you able to tell us more about any Breast Health innovation? Stephen MacMillan : Any Breast Health innovation. I think the way to think about that is, we just continue to innovate. We've always been -- we've brought enhanced detectors, enhanced workflow solutions and enhanced imaging along the way and we'll continue that. Karleen Oberton : Yes, I think we focus -- one of the important focus on innovation is patient experience, focus on that as well as machine learning, what we can do to make radiologists more efficient and certainly that's a big issue outside the U.S. where there's much fewer radiologists. Operator : Thank you. And this now concludes Hologic\u2019s earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rachel, and I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call. Ryan Simon : Thank you, Rachel. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are : one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding the divested blood screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics; finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Our exceptional results confirmed that Hologic is now a much bigger, stronger company with more diverse and durable growth than pre-pandemic. On top of this transformation, with our strong cash flow and exceptional balance sheet, we are operating from a position of strength and are poised to carry our positive momentum forward. We've also said throughout the pandemic that we've dramatically strengthened the company. We recognize that this transformation was harder to see and fully appreciate against a backdrop of COVID spikes and supply chain anomalies. As these clouds continue to clear the result of our robust transformation really shines. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.03 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.06, both results were above the high end of our guidance. Before providing the highlights for the quarter, which admittedly did have two more selling days, and we were going against softer comps from last year due to the Omicron surge, make no mistake about it, we are very proud of these results. First and most notable, our organic revenue, excluding COVID, grew 21.9% and with two out of three divisions growing north of 25%. By division, excluding COVID, Diagnostics were 14.9%, and again, powered by molecular diagnostics, which grew nearly 24%. Surgical also continued to deliver growing 25.2%. And Breast Health returned to growth, posting a very strong performance of 25.7% growth. Our outstanding results are a testament to the commitment of our many colleagues around the world to our purpose, passion and promise to elevate women's health. Without the discipline and incredible execution of our teams who have shown up every day throughout the pandemic. This strong performance would not be possible. Turning to our themes for today. First, we'll provide insight into the growth drivers in each division to showcase and to reinforce the diversity and durability of our transformed business. Second, we'll review our strong performance against our 2023 guidance and longer-term growth targets, helping to frame the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year and longer term. And to close, we'll reflect on where we stand with COVID today, our progress through the pandemic and our excitement as we look ahead. With that brief introduction, let's now focus on our second quarter performance and specifically, the growth drivers powering our strong results. At the highest level, we continue to demonstrate and appreciate that many of you have come to realize our business is dramatically different compared to where we were pre-pandemic. We are more balanced, more diverse and more durable. Through the pandemic, we strategically added growth drivers across the company that are contributing to our top line growth today and will do so for years ahead. These innovative products and services are also accretive to our overall strength within the markets we participate in, deepening our strong relationships with the customers we serve. While the macro environment continues to present a multitude of challenges, you can count on us to deliver. In Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continues to lead the way. Our expanded global installed base of Panthers, over 3,250 strong represents the catalyst for the division's sustained growth. The superior workflow of the Panther combined with our broad menu of nearly 20 FDA-approved assays across the Panther and Panther Fusion systems, creates tremendous value for our customers. and differentiates us from our competition. As we exit the pandemic, we are placing more menu with more throughput on more Panthers and adding more Panther Fusion systems, positioning labs to unlock our full breadth of menu over time. Hologic and our Panther systems are well positioned to continue our strong performance. Consistent with prior quarters, the pillars of Molecular Diagnostics growth were diverse in the period. Growth was driven by our BVCVTV vaginitis panel and aided by our core STI menu, including Clemidiagonrhia, HPV and Trich. We also once again had strong contributions from Biotheranostics and our respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion, where we expect the latter of the two to be more seasonal in nature. In Breast Health, after four quarters of decline, primarily due to semiconductor chip supply headwinds, the division emphatically returned to growth, posting 25.7% growth for the quarter. Comp considerations aside, the strong growth in Breast Health resulted from a combination of four positive factors. First, semiconductor chip availability continues to improve, allowing for the delivery of more gantries in the quarter than planned. This included moving a number of gantries originally allocated for the back half of the year into the second quarter. As a result, for the balance of the year, we anticipate Q3 and Q4 gantry delivery levels to each register modestly below Q2, though still well ahead of last year as our visibility and chip availability continues to strengthen. Second, exceptional demand for our clinically differentiated mammography instruments remains high. And despite the duration of the chip headwind, our backlog remains strong, and we are seeing no increase in order cancellations. Third, in Q2, we again delivered strong service revenue service being the largest source of revenue for the division as we consistently demonstrate our value proposition and strengthen our relationships with customers. And fourth, the interventional side of the Breast Health business returned to form, growing 13.9% for the quarter, driven by our disposable portfolio such as Brevera biopsy needles and Somatex Tumark markers. This strong interventional result also serves as an indication of our success navigating some of the non-chip related supply chain headwinds we faced in prior quarters. To close out Breast Health, we'd like to take this opportunity to thank our chip supply partners who have aligned with our purpose and have prioritized women's health. As a result, we had the ability and confidence to deliver more gantries than projected this quarter, and our customers are better positioned to screen more women sooner rather than later. We are thankful for these strengthened partnerships, which have also undeniably influenced our innovation and design efforts, making Hologic even stronger for the future. While much attention has been given to Diagnostics and Breast Health, our surgical business has also remarkably transformed during the last few years and is emerging as a meaningful driver of growth for us globally, a completely different business than three to four years ago. It's much bigger, stronger and faster growing. In Q2, Surgical grew more than 25% and was driven by strong contributions from our hysteroscopic portfolio of MyoSure the Fluent fluid management system and NovaSure. On the latter, we are encouraged by yet another strong quarter for our latest NovaSure iteration, the NovaSure V5. In addition, our laparoscopic portfolio continues to build momentum and is growing into a larger driver for the division. Now we'll move on from the division growth drivers to reflect on our performance against our guidance for the year. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we said that each division would deliver low double-digit organic growth for 2023, excluding COVID. As the Q2 close marks the halfway point of the fiscal year, we are pleased to share our progress towards achieving our 2023 goal. Through the first half of our fiscal year, the total company has delivered organic growth of nearly 14%, excluding COVID. And by division, Diagnostics, Surgical and Health have grown 15.4%, 19.6% and 9.1%, respectively. This puts us in great shape to achieve or exceed our initial low double-digit 2023 targets. Looking ahead, Diagnostics and Surgical, we will have much tougher comps going forward. By the close of Q3 last year, both divisions were posting solid numbers, resulting in a healthier, stronger comps will now be facing. And for Breast Health going forward, due to the phasing of the chip headwind, the opposite is true. Our Breast Health comps in the back half of fiscal '23 will be softer than in Q2. Now, focusing on our longer-term growth projections with recent very strong results, we understand that some may question whether our 5% to 7% excluding COVID, organic revenue growth rate through 2025 is still appropriate. In short, we believe that it is because we see fiscal '23 as a unique year. Taking a step back, we view our long-term revenue goal as more impressive today due to our expectation for double-digit growth in 2023 on top of our already strong performance since we announced the target. Shifting gears to our final topic today, COVID. In Q2, we generated $71 million in COVID assay revenue, exceeding our prior guidance of $50 million. We are excited for the opportunity to turn the corner and further concentrate our energy and resources to continue to drive our dynamic business forward. Since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, we maximize the opportunities presented. We rose to the occasion, delivering high-quality, highly accurate molecular tests to meet the world's thing needs. For this, we are extremely proud. And should COVID Wave's return leaning on a massive expansion of our manufacturing capacity and operational flexibility, we are even more capable of weathering future storms. We are also extremely proud of the larger and stronger business Hologic is today. We've accelerated years of Panther placements across the globe. And as a byproduct, we expanded our largely domestic business into a much more formidable global enterprise. Today, Hologic is a more recognized and respected worldwide brand which is immensely more influence to advance women's health around the world. With the benefits from our response to the pandemic.We diligently and thoughtfully invested in our business, adding growth driving products through organic R&D innovation and completing strategic acquisitions. And equally important, through it all, even during the strongest quarters of COVID revenue, we maintained expense discipline. We managed our business with precision and never got ahead of ourselves with headcount. And when the world needed it most, we made opportunistic and carefully timed to marketing investments with our Super Bowl ad and WTA sponsorship, each encouraging women to prioritize their health and to return to well woman exams that were put off during the pandemic, maintaining our operational discipline and opportunistic investment approach, affords us the ability to continue to support R&D, marketing and sales initiatives today, all while keeping expenses relatively flat versus a year ago, after adjusting for the Super Bowl and WTA initiatives. All in, our Q2 results demonstrate that we are realizing the benefits of our transformed bigger, stronger business that is fueled by our purpose-driven culture. We've built our culture from the ground up over many years, and it has powered our success through the challenges of pandemic, where we maximized our opportunity. As a result, Hologic has transformed into the strong force we are today and at the same time, transformed our future. We have strengthened our durable growth path, and our future is bright. With that, let me turn the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, I'm going to recap our divisional revenue results, provide a walk-through of our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the full year and third quarter of fiscal 2023. As Steve said, our second quarter financial results were very strong and well ahead of our expectations for both revenue and profitability. Total revenue came in at $1.03 billion beating the midpoint of our guidance by over $70 million. And our non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.06, 25% higher than the midpoint of our guide. . We also continue to repurchase our shares. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares for $50 million. And year-to-date, we have repurchased 2.2 million shares for $150 million. Before moving to our divisional results, we want to emphasize again that our balance sheet is a bedrock of strength in an uncertain macro landscape. With nearly $2.6 billion of cash and a leverage ratio well below our target range, we have tremendous amount of firepower should opportunities for capital deployment arise. However, while we are very active, our philosophy remains to be patient, which we will discuss in more substance shortly. Before we do that, let me recap our divisional revenue results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $464.7 million declined 52.2%. However, it is important to recognize that COVID testing revenue in the prior year period was inflated because of Omicron. Specifically, we generated $584 million of COVID assay revenue in Q2 2022, more than 8x higher than our COVID assay revenue for Q2 2023. Therefore, a more accurate depiction of the long-term health of the Diagnostics business is to exclude COVID assay and related ancillary revenues. By making this adjustment, we see that organic diagnostics revenue increased 14.9% in the quarter. The Diagnostics division continues to be led by molecular, which grew nearly 24% in the period, excluding COVID. As Steve highlighted, Power in Q2 performance within Molecular Diagnostics was our increasingly diverse portfolio of assets as the newer assays contributed alongside our legacy women's health portfolio. Rounding out Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal businesses declined 0.7% compared to the prior year. Moving to Breast Health. Our fiscal second quarter results were terrific. Total revenue of $385.4 million increased 25.7%, and while this performance was aided by soft comps due to supply chain headwinds in the prior year, the outcome still exceeded our estimates. Moving next to Surgical. Second quarter revenue of $144.8 million increased approximately 25% compared to the prior year. And finally, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $31.6 million increased slightly more than 53%. It is important to point out that growth rates in our Skeletal business can change based on the timing of just a few orders, therefore, we would caution when modeling not to extrapolate this level of growth going forward. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin of 62.1% was driven by strong performance in our base business and higher-than-expected COVID-19 testing revenues. Total operating expenses of $317 million in the second quarter decreased 6.3%. The decrease was driven by less marketing spend as our Super Bowl ad in the initial portion of the expense from our partnership with the WTA were incurred in the prior year period. When normalizing for these marketing initiatives, total operating expenses would have been relatively flat compared to the prior year, partially offsetting lower marketing spend in the quarter was higher R&D and sales expense as we continue to invest in internal programs to drive top line growth. Below operating income, other expense represented a gain in our fiscal second quarter. Net, we benefited from higher interest rates in the period as interest income from our nearly $2.6 billion cash balance more than offset elevated interest expense on our floating rate debt instruments. Finally, our tax rate in Q2 was 19%, as expected. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q2 came in at 31.3% and net margin was 25.9%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $265.7 million and non-GAAP EPS was $1.06. Moving on from the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $206.3 million in the second quarter. We had nearly $2.6 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage ratio remained at 0.2x. As it relates to our broader capital allocation strategy, our philosophy remains unchanged. We continue to be very active and selective in screening potential targets, while also exercising discipline and patience. We are operating from a position of strength as we explore opportunities. Now let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2023. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect strong financial results with total revenue in the range of $930 million to $980 million, representing another quarter of double-digit growth when you exclude COVID. For the full year fiscal 2023, we are again increasing our guidance and expect total revenue in the range of $3.925 billion to $4.025 billion. To help with constant currency modeling, we are assuming minimal foreign exchange headwinds in the third quarter at less than $5 million. And for the full year, we are expecting approximately $40 million in foreign exchange headwinds. These headwinds have improved compared to our previous guidance as the relative strength of the U.S. dollar has abated over the past several months. Turning to our divisions. Each business maintains its own unique growth drivers for the remainder of our fiscal 2023 and beyond. In Diagnostics, we expect continued strong performance out of molecular, aided by steady support from cytology. Within molecular, we are excited to go after additional greenfield opportunities with newer assays such as BV/CVTV and Amgen, while also reinforcing our leadership position in core women's health screening. Closing out non-COVID diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of slightly more than $30 million for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $25 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $245 million for the full year. COVID-related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be slightly less than $30 million in the third quarter and approximately $120 million for the full year. Moving to Breast Health. As mentioned, we capitalized on improved chip availability and moved a number of gantries allocated for the back half of the year into Q2. As a result, we are assuming total Breast Health revenue above Q1 2023 levels for each quarter in the back half of this fiscal year, but below Q2. These results are still expected to deliver healthy double-digit revenue growth compared to the prior year in Q3 and Q4. Finally, in Surgical, we expect strong low double-digit growth in fiscal Q3 and for the full year. Starting with our legacy portfolio, we are pleased by the performance of NovaSure and MyoSure. In NovaSure, customers continue to see the benefits of our innovative V5 line extension. And with MyoSure, we continue to grow the myomectomy total addressable market. However, the beauty of our surgical business today is that the franchise is more than just NovaSure, MyoSure, and our guidance contemplates fluent, Bolder and Acessa adding accretive growth to the division's top line. Moving down the P&Listen-only mode, for the full year, we continue to expect our non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the low 60s, and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Within this operating margin profile, we have again incorporated elevated inflationary pressures into our guidance of approximately 200 to 250 basis points, which we expect to persist throughout fiscal 2023 and likely into fiscal 2024. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to move lower sequentially in Q3 and remain relatively flat in Q4. As Steve shared, we are proud of how we have managed expenses over the last several years. Our level of operating expense is expected to decline not because of reduction in head count but rather due to our efficient management of larger marketing initiatives coinciding with periods of elevated COVA testing revenue. Below operating income, we expect other income net to be an expense of slightly more than $20 million for the full year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $250 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected non-GAAP EPS of $0.83 to $0.93 in the third quarter and $3.75 to $3.95 for the year. To conclude, our strong second quarter results exceeded our guidance, and we are once again raising our full year estimates despite larger macro uncertainties. Our growth in the quarter was broad-based with each business growing double digits organically, excluding COVID. Our results reinforce the fact that Hologic is a much stronger company than just a few years ago. We are larger and more durable than prior to the pandemic and balance sheet is as strong as it's ever been. As we move to the back half of our fiscal 2020 , we are excited to continue to advance women's health, while also delivering strong financial results and creating value for all of our stakeholders. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Karleen, maybe just 1 on the margin profile. You guys have done 31%, I think, both this quarter and last quarter. That guidance still for 30% op margins, obviously implies a bit of a step down here in the second half. Can you just talk about, I guess, the moving pieces in the second half? And then just thinking forward about what the right exit rate would be? Because, obviously, again, the second half will be a little lower as we work our way towards '24, just thinking about the margin profile. I know during COVID, you guys always talked about kind of that landing rate margin numbers. So if we could just revisit that and the second half and then also does that move forward right ballpark to think about the out margin would be helpful? Karleen Oberton : Yes, sure. So I think when you look at the second half compared to the first two quarters, certainly, the low COVID revenue are putting pressure on that operating margin compared to the first half. And I think prior to pandemic, Patrick, what is also putting pressure on those operating margins are the higher inflationary costs that we've quantified it. 200 to 250 basis points for the full year. So I think moving forward to think about low 30s is probably the right way to think about it as we move forward, like you said. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. Understood. M&A commentary, Steve, that's something that's come up a lot more this quarter with investors. I know Karleen, I think you had a tremendous amount of firepower there during the call. Can you just talk about the pipeline, the appetite here? I know you guys want to be patient, but what the right sizing is, whether it's a leverage ratio? Is -- are you looking only in core areas, Steve, I believe you said in the past, you don't want to add another leg to the stool, but would love to just talk through the M&A side, given it's become a bit more of a focus here since last quarter? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think overall, Patrick, our strategy remains the same, which is being patient, diligent and active. And I think our focus continues to be leveraging the capabilities and strengths that we have and leveraging the existing sales channels. So bulking up the businesses that we have makes sense. We are considering widening the aperture to consider larger deals, but frankly, those would be things with more mature earnings profiles and still be accretive to growth. So each of the divisions has some pretty nice pipelines. We've also because the core business is doing so well, again, I think it gives us that ability to be patient because we don't have to do anything. And so it's this magical combination of we can afford to be patient. We've got a lot going on, but we'll continue to see where it goes. Operator : We'll take our next question from the line of Tim Daley with Wells Fargo. Timothy Daley : So just curious about the growth performance driven by the selling days. I think you guys called out two extra selling days in the quarter. What was the contribution of that towards growth? And then how should we think about that for the year? And then as well, any potential offsets or not once we start thinking about modeling 2024? Karleen Oberton : Yes, the contribution really wasn't that significant, probably less than 200 basis points in the quarter. I think when we compare it to Q1, we had that full calendar week, which drives the service revenue which really didn't have any minimal impact in this quarter. And as we look at the balance of the year, I think it's a pretty negligible effect of extra days. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Casey Woodring with JPMorgan. Casey Woodring : So you talked about Breast Health pull forward on ship allocations, which sort of drove the non-COVID beat here. Is there further upside to chip allocations this year because we see another surprise pump in the back half, I would be interested to hear what you're hearing from suppliers on that front? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, Casey, I think it was kind of more of a onetime bump here as it now gets very steady. I think we feel really good about our visibility frankly, not just through '23 but into '24, and we continue to manage this for the long haul. We had to run a little extra over time for some of our service people with the extra installs, and I think we'll be at a really good rate here going forward. Casey Woodring : Great. And then just longer term, have you changed your expectations at all within molecular diagnostics as it relates to the 5% to 7% total diagnostic growth guide? Just looking at non-COVID side has been strong for a number of quarters. So just trying to think through your expectations on that business, have they changed at all since you gave that initial guidance now back in July of 2021? Stephen MacMillan : Longer term, not necessarily. We always just want to be careful not to get ahead of ourselves. I think clearly, in the short term, and what we aspire to be is certainly better. And clearly, what we're putting up right now is great. Now it's going to be much tougher clearly when we start bumping up against 24% comparable levels, then growing that in that 5% to 7% on top of those numbers. cumulative is going to be a lot better off than frankly, when we gave the guidance. So in fact, in some ways, it actually is much higher, but we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves on that number. Karleen Oberton : Yes, Casey, I would just add that we've always said that we'd expect molecular to be at that high end of that 5% to 7%, if not slightly over, but overall, Dx would be within the 5% to 7%. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group. Anthony Petrone : And congrats on another strong quarter here. The first 1 will be on surgical the 25% organic. Just trying to get an understanding of how much of that is underlying procedures within women's health just coming back versus, let's say, synergies with Bolder Surgical? And then I'll have 1 quick follow-up on molecular. Stephen MacMillan : Sure, Anthony. I think it's probably more the market coming back. And combined with Surgical was weaker in this quarter a year ago because of the Onton surge. And I think the I go back to a year ago where people were kind of picking at gee, surgical might not be as strong or whatever else, and it was back to. That was a market dynamic, and I think now there's probably some catch-up going on procedure-wise as you're hearing really across the med tech space. And having said that, I think we feel really good about how we're performing among that, both with our existing businesses and frankly, having the broader portfolio that you referenced. Karleen Oberton : Yes, we're just -- we're getting some really nice traction internationally with our surgical business, a smaller base, but like I said, some really nice traction that's helping that growth rate for sure. . Anthony Petrone : And then on molecular, just excluding COVID, another strong quarter. And just wondering if you could provide an update on where utilization on the Panther systems that were placed during the pandemic, those new systems where you had some demand pull, just where utilization on those systems is today? And where do you think it can go over the next 12 to 18 months? Karleen Oberton : Yes, Anthony, we haven't really -- we haven't disclosed that utilization number, but what we have said is that of the new Panthers placed since April 2020, over 85% customers globally are driving at least 1 other assay beyond COVID. And I think 55% have at least 2 other assays that are driving that utilization. So feel good about the stickiness of those Panthers, the new Panthers that have been placed. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Liza Garcia with UBS. Elizabeth Garcia : Congrats on another strong quarter. I guess on a maybe Biotheranostics. So you guys -- maybe if you could dive in there and thinking about that one. So I know you said strong contribution there, but I know you recently opened up the lab and you've been working on initiatives to help that improving the customer ordering flow. But how do we think about the run rate of the business there and where that can go and kind of thinking about that in the diagnostics platform? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think we are as excited, if not more excited about the growth potential, probably more excited even, I would say, Liza today than when we acquired the business. The team that we have there is great. As you mentioned, we've now brought the lab over from nearby we've consolidated into our San Diego facility. And I think we're realizing that the penetration of this opportunity relative to the full market is still in the very low single digits. So there's potentially a lot of runway. We've been putting in more automation, frankly, just to make the ordering systems easier and other stuff. And I think we're really excited. It's clearly growing very accretive to the growth rate of the division, and we think will be for -- that's 1 of those for years to come. Elizabeth Garcia : Great. That's helpful. And then just circling back to kind of guidance surge. I know that there was some weakness last quarter, but even kind of when you do the two-year stack, I'm still getting to some low double digits kind of growth there. And I think you've called out just kind of the performance of NovaSure and V5 kind if you could just dig in a little bit on kind of -- it seems like it's been surprising you to the upside there. And obviously, I know that you got Fluent and Acessa as well. Just kind of where that portfolio can go and how you think about that and the growth levels there? Stephen MacMillan : Liza, I think this is 1 we've been incredibly excited under the leadership of Essex Mitchell, who's been running that business now for the last few years. he's dramatically strengthened both the U.S. business as well as we've made a couple of those great acquisitions of Acessa and Bolder. And so we are seeing some really nice growth. I still think this quarter, may have been a little bit of procedural catch-up in the overall market. So we never -- as you know, we never want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but we love the team that we have there now. And as Karleen said, and you can see in the press release, the growth rate internationally now for Surgical is really, really doing well. We're north of 30%. And I think in this quarter, close to 40-ish and that's starting to become meaningful. So I think our -- as we sit here today and think about another growth driver for this company, Surgical is definitely in there. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Andrew Cooper : Maybe just 1 more on breast and thinking about the commentary for the back half of the year. How much of that pull forward do we think about working the backlog down and that's why maybe a little bit lower quarter-over-quarter into 3Q versus still being a little bit limited by chip supply? Just where are you in terms of kind of the allocations versus what you'd ideally like to have? And just help us think about sort of the cadence as we work through the back half of the year in terms of why a little bit lower or being able to maintain maybe the great level that you saw in this quarter? Karleen Oberton : Yes. What hasn't changed is the chip availability. And with that increased confidence we allowed to accelerate into Q2 from the back half. So the total production outlook hasn't changed. And I think as we've always as Steve mentioned, to accelerate even here in the quarter is an uptake on our service, our field service engineers to do those installs. So like we've said all along, we don't think we'll have any outsized quarters as we move through this recovery. And certainly, cancellations are at a minimal level and that backlog is still really strong. Andrew Cooper : Okay. Super helpful. And then maybe just 1 more. You mentioned the respiratory seasonality in the prepared remarks. So can you maybe just help us think about the sizing of kind of where that business is on a non-COVID basis today? And how you think about what that seasonality really looks like through the course of the year as it continues to kind of stick with us post-COVID? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I mean really strong performance. If we think about growth year-over-year, that non-COVID respiratory more than doubled versus prior year in the quarter. But what we are planning conservatively is a significant step down in Q3 and Q4, given the seasonal nature of the respiratory infections. But this continues as the flu seasons in the flu season, we're seeing really nice uptake in growth in that business. Operator : Our next question comes from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Puneet Souda : Steve, congrats on another solid quarter here. So first one, at a high level, given the macro uncertainty which businesses -- I mean, if things -- obviously, recessionary talk is here and ongoing and expectations are sort of lower for the second half across overall in the economy. So where do you think the businesses can hold up better versus others where the team is continuing to watch sort of more closely for the demand term versus where you think the demand will continue to outpace the macro uncertainties? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. Truthfully, I think we feel good about all three of the businesses as we go into the back half of the year. I mean, obviously, it's -- the biggest thing is it's 1 reason we wouldn't get ahead of ourselves and start to raise guidance and long-term expectations when we're going into that exact uncertainty that you're referencing. But the fundamentals of each of the businesses, I think we feel really good about. Puneet Souda : Got it. And then a question on HPV stand-alone versus co-testing that's come up again in our investor conversations. So just wondering any updated thoughts on the potential for it to go stand-alone versus co-testing? And do you think the USPSTF guidelines could get revised potentially with updated information from ACC? And do you see any risk for COVID testing from sort of primary testing with the new emerging competitors in the space? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. Let's start at the highest level. There is no doubt in our minds that more frequent co-testing is still the absolute best health care for women. There are anecdotal increases that we're starting to see upticks in cervical cancer screening since the intervals have gotten longer. And frankly, there's enough data out there that is co-testing is significantly better than HPV primary alone. So while there are those advocating for that and USPSTF could do that. It doesn't make it the best science. And I think where we feel really, really good. And as you know, in our tagline is the science of sure. We feel it's our responsibility to bring the best care to women around the world, and we're going to continue to drive for co-testing as the right way to go. So -- and frankly, I think most of the -- certainly, most of the U.S. doctors are well aware of that. And even if the USPSTF does something to change those guidelines. We think that will be slow to change because of the remarkable success of the PAP test in largely almost eliminating cervical cancer screening over the last generation or two particularly in the U.S. So it's something we feel very strongly about, and we believe time and the science will be on our side. Having said that, there's going to be pressure. There's deep pocket pharmaceutical companies that want to try to drive to HPV primary. But we feel really good about the science on our side and that our business will be more durable. Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Wanted to get your latest expectations on COVID-19. So I heard the guidance commentary. We've heard from some of the big labs about volume following off and we have the PHE expiry coming soon. Can you just talk about like the stickiness of this product line and what your latest stab is on when an endemic number or guidepost might be for 2024 here? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, Jack, I think the fundamental reality on COVID is none of us have been able to predict more than a quarter out going. I think, if anything, our expectations for next year might be a little bit less I think we're certainly starting to see it start to ramp off a bit. And yet, what we feel really good about is those that are still going to do it, we'll be using us. I think there'll still be usage at the hospital levels for admissions, for staff, those kind of pieces. So I think we're still going to have some ongoing business, but we're still having it this quarter. But I think clearly, you see it coming down to just a few percentage points of the total business at this point. And it's hard to fully predict certainly by the time a guidance next year will be more up to date. But it certainly looks like it's falling off pretty sharply at this point, which keep down for our company and getting on with it and letting people look at the true transformation of the business, we kind of like but a little bit of that profit flowing through isn't bad either. Jack Meehan : Yes, makes sense. Just as a follow-up, I wanted to talk about something that might be a little bit more not that COVID isn't durable, but might be more durable in the eyes of investors, the vaginitis panel. Can you just give any color on the size of that business now? Is it annualizing over $100 million at this point? And just talk about like the penetration in your customer base, how is that going? Karleen Oberton : Yes. We're really pleased with the performance in that uptake and our full year outlook would be that, that would be over a $100 million business. Clearly, 1 of our top women's health assays and think there's still room to grow there. So really excited about that uptake and what we can do there with our customers. Stephen MacMillan : It's been a really nice surprise for us how big that's getting held quickly, Jack. Operator : Our next question comes from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Tejas Savant : One quick cleanup question on guidance. Actually, Steve, if I may. You got the approval in Europe and Canada on V5 for NovaSure. How are you thinking about the revenue implications of that over the medium term here? NovaSure. I mean, it's been a flattish business, doesn't get too much attention from investors, but I think it's still the second largest piece of that segment for you? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. That business has been a great business. When I arrived here 10 years ago. The -- that was the big part of this division. That was most of it, and Myosure was this little thing. And it's been fun to see MyoSure come up. But I think our team has done a great job of really trying to maintain NovaSure in the midst of all kinds of both market issues from the ACA Act and everything else and just continue to bring innovation, and it's still a great procedure. So I think the overall procedural numbers, that marketplace probably continues to be a low single-digit decliner. But I think we do -- we're doing well within that from a share and an innovation standpoint. Tejas Savant : Got it. That's helpful. And then one on Imaging. Karleen, I know you talked about sort of the cadence you're normalizing versus F2 2Q levels for the gantries. But did you benefit at all from this very significant correction in demand that some of these semi manufacturers are seeing? I know you've talked about your chips being very distinct from what into consumer products in the past. But just curious as to whether that drove a little bit of the uplift here? And to your point, Steve, around the macro being something you're watching, is this just sort of a little bit of conservatism and wider error bars around sort of the normalization trajectory here that's making you take a relatively conservative stance of the gantry replacements versus the field service engineers in that aspect of it? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So just on the chip issue itself, I don't -- increasing availability was not the direct result of demand dropping other sectors. It is more of our partnerships with our suppliers and having them understand what we're using the chips for and how important they are and really working closely with them versus other sectors, demand declining. And sorry, you had a second part of that question. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. And the other part was just -- we're being conservative. I think we're managing for the long haul here, too. We're very much thinking about 2024 and what things look like there. And I think this is already a really, really good year, and let's get ahead of ourselves. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Brackmann with William Blair. Andrew Brackmann : I've actually got two questions on Molecular Diagnostics and sexual health specifically. So I'll just ask them both the front. First, CDC had the report out a few weeks ago showing the rise in FTI cases. So maybe can you just sort of remind us on some of the initiatives that you have here with customers and public health services broadly for your testing solutions? And then just secondly, on this platform, can you just sort of talk about what you're seeing internationally with this franchise anything in terms of where wins might be coming from, be that versus competitor tests or even sort of LDTs transitioning here? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think the first part, Andrew, really is -- I think it's the given gem of our company that doesn't always get as much attention, but is that dedicated physician sales force that we have within our Diagnostics business, that's really unique. It's an extra investment from our end, but it is having our reps that call on the physicians and really help educate them, both about the guidelines and including the changing guidelines where we've gone to effectively the need to opt out. So you're getting more screening earlier. And we're -- it allows us to partner with a lot of the major labs and even hospital systems where they value that education that we do. And it helps us both shape but also build markets. When you look at really what Hologic has done, and I think we've been pretty good about it across our businesses, we've helped create a lot of markets through physician education. I mean, if you go back to the original Pap test and thin prep and what we did there, what NovaSure and MyoSure have done, and we're doing it a lot in diagnostics, certainly through the STIs. And to the second part of your question on international, I think, again, by placing so many Panthers internationally, it's allowed us to have more of those discussions and start to get some of that menu in around the world as well and then hopefully able to help educate and shift guidelines in those countries over the years ahead as well. Karleen Oberton : Yes. The only thing I would add internationally for molecular diagnostics is our viral business, specifically in Africa continues to have really nice double-digit growth as we make investments there to help that region. Operator : Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. John Murphy : This is John on for Derek. I wanted to ask, so recently, a federal judge struck down a key provisions of the Affordable Care Act and that kind of jeopardize the free coverage of wide-ranging preventive services, including mammograms and cervical cancer screening. How do you see this playing out? And I guess, are you worried at all about reimbursement? Or is that -- or do you have any fear of having to pay -- or the patients having to pay out of pocket and that will deter them from screening? Stephen MacMillan : No. I mean, there's been so many various court cases between state, federal, all kinds of, frankly, goofiness going on in the political and court systems right now. we tend to think here, things will prevail and be fine over time. So we're not going to react any 1 thing that could easily get overturned again. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Vijay Kumar : Steve, congrats on a really strong quarter here. Stephen MacMillan : Thanks. Sorry, I missed you on the visit out here. Vijay Kumar : No. No, all good. You guys made it up with the print. I guess on some of the numbers we're seeing here, Steve. I'm this is almost. Stephen MacMillan : Personality come on. Vijay Kumar : You made it up with some pretty impressive numbers. This is almost also kind of numbers 20%. Now and from an perspective, there's backlog. So I was just curious, when you look at numbers like 25% GYN, and 15% overall diagnostics to you. What do you think is driving this? Is this a catch-up of backlog? Or is this perhaps a pull forward of demand? And related to that, Steve, first half, I think the organic now was almost teens, mid-teens. I think the prior guidance here for all segments, double digits. Is the implication now for the back half 6% to 7% in line with the longer-term shafts? So just talk about what drove first half and what the implication is for the second half? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think the implication for the second half is still much better than the numbers you just mentioned the -- we're still saying double digit here in the third quarter and likely fourth. So I think -- I don't think it was pull forward, Vijay, to be very clear. I do think the GynSurg market probably like some of the ortho markets and some of the other markets, some of the docs may have been doing more, what I would call catch up. So I don't think it's as much pull forward, but they're catching up from the last few years not maybe doing as many procedures as they could have. So I think will that same quarter a year from now, maybe not be quite as active yes, but I don't think it was any kind of pull forward per se. I think it's more catch-up. And I think we just feel great about our surgical business, we have added more growth drivers. I think, again, it's been kind of missed in the COVID spikes. I think it's the business that's been most overlooked because of the way the COVID spikes were happening. And just really proud of what that team is doing and we've added Fluent we got MyoSure and NovaSure doing well, and then we've got Bolder and Acessa. And we've got that business getting stronger internationally. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Steve. And Karleen, one for you here. I know you called out the data, any days impact here in back half are days never a headwind here in the back half? And -- sorry, on capital allocation, is this -- Steve, sorry, I missed your comments. Are you saying like the pipeline is looking healthier? Maybe just put some context around the M&A commentary here on perhaps we're getting closer to something here in the near term versus how we should interpret your commentary around the pipeline looking good across all segments? Karleen Oberton : Yes. Let me start with the days, Vijay. So we have, I think, 1 less day in the fourth quarter. So really negligible impact in the back half of the year when we talk about selling days. And again, here in the second quarter, a little bit of benefit, but not to the extent that we had in the first quarter given the full calendar week and how that impacts our service line. . And let me try to answer your M&A. I think what I would say is a couple of things, as we said in the prepared remarks, our philosophy and approach hasn't changed. Division-led, very active, probably some rebuilding over the past year in diagnostics of the pipeline, given the level of acquisitions we did in 2021. But we're approaching it from a position of strength. Our aperture is a little wider, given our firepower and that we can look at some things that may be a little bigger than we've done in the past. But certainly, those things we're looking for mature on product -- on market products and accretive to earnings. So not looking for a fourth leg of a stool that just to leverage our strengths and capabilities that we have across our current businesses. Operator : Our next question comes from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas Exane. Navann Ty Dietschi : I just have a few on women's health. So what's the vaginosis assay still the key driver of Q2 performance? And can you discuss the competitive environment in women's health, so competitors far behind, given Hologics, competitive advantage and women's health focus? And does Hologic still benefit from the opt-out guideline for its legacy test? And I have a follow-up on M&A after. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So our vaginosis panel, as we said, we really like the performance that we're seeing. The outlook would be that, that's greater than $100 million for 2023 and really put that as 1 of our top assay. Women's health was still market leaders in protecting that market leadership. And as Steve said, one of the kind of the secret sauce that's underappreciated in how we do that is our physician sales force that's out there educating physicians on guidelines, promoting testing, and certainly where we saw a change in guidelines about two years ago where it's more universal screening. We're helping grow our business as well as our customers' business with acquisition sales force. Navann Ty Dietschi : And then on M&A, so would M&A part of the international expansion? Or is it mostly -- or is international expansion mostly expanding the installed base and menu? Karleen Oberton : From an M&A perspective, certainly, some of the recent deals we did -- we acquired companies that were based overseas, but Mobidiag, the biggest 1 would have potential revenue from the U.S. and OUS over time. And then we do have our GoDirect strategy, primarily in our breast health and we've done a little in surgical, where we've, in the past, leverage dealers. And what we find is when we go direct, those businesses perform better as part of Hologic than on a stand-alone basis. But certainly, as a global organization, we look at acquisitions around the globe, not just in the U.S. Operator : Thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cynthia, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call. Please go ahead. Ryan Simon : Thank you, Cynthia. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them, as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are one, organic revenue which we define as revenue excluding the divested blood screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Our results were solid. Total revenue was $984 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.93. Revenue exceeded our prior guidance and EPS finished at the high end of our range. These results showcase the power of our transformed business and demonstrate that Hologic is built for the long-term with the broadest, strongest foundation we've ever had. On top of this transformation, with our strong cash flow and outstanding balance sheet, we continue to operate from a position of strength, with strong operational discipline as we forge ahead. Once again, the proof is in the numbers. Total company organic growth, excluding COVID was rather remarkable at 18.4%. By division, we posted 11.8% organic diagnostics growth ex-COVID and 14.5% growth in Surgical. Standing alone, these growth rates are impressive. Given a wider context, we view these performances as exceptionally strong, because we delivered these results on top of 15% growth in Diagnostics and 9.7% growth in Surgical in Q3 of 2022, both very high bars from a year ago. And in Breast Health, as expected, we delivered another strong quarter of 27.5% growth as chip supply and gantry availability continue to improve and track to our expectations. For this fiscal year, we remain on pace to achieve or exceed our 2023 low double-digit organic growth targets, excluding COVID. In fact, our expected growth rate for fiscal '23 is now more than double our 5% to 7% long-term growth target. Based on our strong performance for a number of quarters now, combined with our continued confidence in our growth ahead, we've recently given serious consideration to raising our long-term target. But given the uncertain macro environment we face, 5% to 7% is still very much a solid long-term outlook. Put simply, there are two reasons why. First, as you all well know, growing 5% to 7% on top of double-digit growth is clearly more challenging than growing 5% to 7% against single-digit comps. For example, in fiscal 2024, we will lap several prior periods of double-digit growth throughout the year. Net, we'll be entering 2024 already much bigger and stronger than when we first set the goal. And second, there are macro business and geopolitical challenges that persist today, which did not exist back in 2021 when we first set our guide. We will expand on this aspect later in today's call. Taken together, overcoming this combination of challenges, while maintaining 5% to 7% growth is in some ways an even last year goal than when we first established it. On that note, let's move on to our focus for today. First, we will highlight the strengths of our business that underpin our strong Q3 results. Our strengths are diverse and durable. And second, with a discussion of the unique advantages we provide our customers, we hope you'll share our confidence that Hologic is built for the long-term. Moving forward to our Q3 growth drivers. As mentioned, excluding COVID, each division posted double-digit organic growth for the quarter. Equally impressive is the year-over-year consistency of our growth drivers, a direct result of execution against our business strategy. In Diagnostics, the division's overall 11.8% organic growth rate, excluding COVID, was again driven by strong performance in molecular. For the quarter, Molecular Diagnostics posted approximately 13% growth ex-COVID, on top of growing over 20% a year ago. Growth in molecular was driven by a combination of both newer assays like BV, CV/TV and contributions from Amgen and HSV, each growing well into the double digits as well as strong growth from our longstanding women's health menu. Rounding out Molecular Diagnostics, our Biotheranostics acquisition continues to shine, being both accretive to our top and bottom lines. Cytology and Perinatal led by cytology, also contributed strong growth this quarter, growing nearly 10%. Cytology's elevated growth for Q3 was driven by the timing of a few large orders placed in the last week of the quarter before the extended July 4 holiday. We view this as a one-time lift as opposed to a shift in the trajectory of the business. That said, co-testing, which includes the Pap+HPV continues to be the preferred cervical cancer screening method for medical practitioners. These are the same practitioners who are on the front lines who know the science and who have seen the overwhelmingly positive impact of the Pap and co-testing firsthand. By our estimates, nearly 99% of cervical cancer screening today in the United States is performed using a combination of the Pap alone or co-testing. Why? The reason is clear. The Pap test has been the most successful cancer screening test in history. Since the Pap was introduced over 80 years ago, the rate of cervical cancer, which was the leading cause of death among women, has fallen by more than 70%. As an advocate of women's health for over 35 years, we continue to support best-in-class care for women, and for cervical cancer screening, the gold standard is co-testing with ThinPrep, the Pap+HPV. Shifting to Breast Health. As expected, we posted another exceptional quarter, growing revenue 27.5%. This strong performance was driven primarily by the ongoing return of our Mammography business as well as solid contributions from service. In Mammography, as we guided in May, we delivered more gantries in Q3 than Q1 and slightly less than in Q2. Demand for our clinically differentiated gantries remains high. In addition, our backlog is still at historically elevated levels. We are in great shape to work down this backlog to more normal levels throughout our fiscal 2024 and possibly beyond. In breast service, our business continues to grow and is becoming an even larger part of the division's mix. Our strong service performance represents stable contracted recurring revenue and demonstrates deepening relationships with our customers. Now moving on to Surgical and our International business. The newer pillars of growth for our company that may not be fully appreciated. In Surgical, the business continues to grow stronger for longer, growing 14.5% in Q3. Revenue growth was again driven by MyoSure and the Fluent Fluid Management System. With contributions from NovaSure V5 and our newer laparoscopic portfolio. Specifically, while still early days in smaller dollars, Bolder continues its strong growth as we leverage our relationships with our GYN customers and explore adjacent surgical channels. The transformation of our Surgical business over recent years has been phenomenal. It underscores the value of both internal innovation plus product line additions through M&A, a winning formula across Hologic. In Surgical, the sum of both strategies has injected new life into the business and transformed it into a meaningful growth driver for the company. Our international business also continues to impress, growing 20.9% in the quarter, excluding COVID. In May, our global leadership team traveled to our Brussels office as part of our annual strategic planning process, spending a week in Brussels reinforced a sense of pride within our leadership team. We are proud of the strides we've made expanding our global footprint and even more important, we are proud of the energy and culture we've built around the world. Coupled with a strong base of talent we have developed over the past few years. We firmly believe our highly engaged workforce and purpose-driven culture truly set us apart. As we've said before, the revenue growth rate for our international business is accretive to our overall growth rate. We expect this trend to continue throughout our long-term horizon. Related, earlier in today's call, we referenced persistent macro challenges in the context of our long-term guide. When we first announced our 5% to 7% guide, we were expecting tailwinds in places like China and Russia, rather than the headwinds they have become. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to our targets and with strong performance in other geographies where we operate, our international growth remains on track. This is a testament to the commitment, grit, and determination of all our employees that support and drive our efforts around the world. Now shifting gears to discuss the advantage we provide to our customers and how we are poised for long-term success. To fully appreciate where we're going, we must reflect on where we've been. From there, we will shed light on our unwavering patient and customer focus, which sets the stage for our bright future. Our transformation has been years in the making. It started even before COVID and as we know, accelerated during the pandemic. In the early days of COVID, when fear and uncertainty led to closures and shutdowns, we delivered our highly accurate COVID molecular diagnostic tests around the globe, playing a pivotal role in helping get the world back on its feet. With COVID surges and high testing volumes now further in the rearview mirror, our ongoing performance shows that we are much more than a great pandemic story. Without a doubt, we are a bigger, stronger company with more durable and diverse growth drivers and positioned well for the long haul. On top of this transformation, with our strong cash flow and exceptional balance sheet, we operate today from a position of strength and continue to exercise operational discipline. As we look ahead, we are laser focused on our purpose, passion and promise and never lose sight of the needs of our patients and our customers. This is the magic within our business. Today, our customers face the challenge of navigating this new operating environment. They seek vendors who can help them operate as efficiently as possible. For labs and hospitals, pressures from inflation and labor shortages remain despite recent improvement. With efficiency a priority, when our customers think of Hologic, they see opportunity. The opportunity to consolidate around our portfolio of products in Diagnostics, Breast Health and Surgical that offer innovative solutions to dramatically improve their operational efficiency. Seconds can turn to minutes and days of time and labor savings throughout the course of a year. In each of our businesses, we feature products that streamline workflows and create real advantages that our customers not only love, but need. From our sophisticated automation with Panther and advances in AI with digital cytology and Diagnostics to our industry-leading gantry scan speed, and streamlined biopsy process with Brevera in Breast Health. And finally, our efficient fluid management approach with Fluent in Surgical. Workflow efficiency is in the DNA of our entire portfolio. In addition, the fact that we have specialized service teams to focus on the unique needs of our customers adds to our competitive advantage. Our customers know that when they choose Hologic, they not only receive world-class products but also world-class service. Between our robust portfolio of industry-leading products and specialized service capabilities, we create a very attractive opportunity for our customers. We offer real and measurable efficiencies that improve their bottom lines. And more importantly, improve the standard of care for patients. This combination sets us up well to meet our customers' needs, both today and into the future. and creates an incredible pathway for Hologic's success. In closing, there are many companies that can sell products. There are fewer who can consistently deliver so many leadership brands and sector-leading margins over the long-term and there are even fewer who can succeed financially, while also helping the world. At Hologic, we do all three. We are tremendously proud to continue our journey, delivering outstanding top-line growth and profitability. Driving value for all our stakeholders and further enabling our ability to make a profound impact on patients' lives and women's health around the world. With that, I will now turn the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, we will briefly revisit our divisional revenue results, walk down our income statement, and speak to a few balance sheet and cash flow items. We will wrap up with our guidance for the full-year and fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. As Steve highlighted, our third quarter financial results were strong, showcasing the durability of our business and the diversified contributions to our growth. Total revenue came in at $984 million, exceeding our estimates, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.93, meeting the high end of our previous guidance range. Now starting with our divisional revenue performance. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $439.7 million declined 21.3%. However, excluding COVID assay and related ancillary revenues, the division grew 11.8% in the quarter. We are once again thrilled by the solid performance, which reinforces the underlying strength of our Diagnostics business. As Steve shared, Molecular Diagnostics grew approximately 13% during our third quarter, excluding the impact of COVID. Additionally, the Cytology and Perinatal business posted nearly 10% growth in our fiscal third quarter. For reasons previously discussed, when modeling, we would advise not to extrapolate this level of growth going forward to our Cytology and Perinatal segment. Moving to Breast Health. Total third quarter revenue of $360.3 million increased 27.5%. In conjunction with our Q2 performance, these results provide further evidence of strong demand for the division's portfolio of products and services. While the current cares revenue growth rate was assisted by supply chain headwinds in the prior year, we are encouraged by the trajectory of the business and the increasing predictability of our semiconductor chip supply. Moving next to Surgical. Third quarter revenue of $157.3 million increased nearly 15% compared to the prior year. Our internal R&D efforts, international execution, and recent laparoscopic acquisitions are contributed to an increasingly diverse and robust business. And finally, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $27.1 million was also very strong, increasing 25%. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 60.8% was driven by strong performance in our base business, and COVID-19 testing revenues, which came in slightly above our expectations. Total operating expenses of $313.9 million in the third quarter increased nominally by 0.9%. This increase was driven by higher sales and R&D expenses, but partially offset by lower marketing spend. Below operating income, other income once again represented a gain in our fiscal third quarter. We continue to benefit from higher interest rates as interest income from our cash balance of nearly $2.8 billion, and the favorable impact of our interest rate hedge has more than offset higher interest expense on our floating rate debt. Our tax rate in Q3 was 21.4%, higher than previously anticipated. The increase in this quarter's effective tax rate represents a cumulative catch-up in the current period to increase our annual tax rate from 19% to 19.75%. The increase in our tax rate for fiscal 2023 is driven by stronger than forecasted domestic performance and losses outside the U.S., which we cannot claim benefit from at this time. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q3 came in at 28.9% and net margin was 23.5%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $231.3 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.93. Finally, while up to this point, we have discussed non-GAAP financial metrics, we feel it's important to call out a non-cash impairment charge related to Mobidiag, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. To be clear, we continue to be excited about Mobidiag and its long-term potential. As we've previously shared, due to various challenges our entry to the U.S. market will be materially beyond our initial deal model expectations. During our annual strategic planning process in Q3 the need to lower the carrying value of primarily Mobidiag's intangible assets became evident. As a result, we booked a GAAP write-down of $197 million in the quarter specific to Mobidiag, which primarily impacts cost, but also operating expenses. Moving on from the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $332.7 million in our third quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.77 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net leverage ratio of 0.1x. In addition, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of $114 million in the period. Year-to-date, we have purchased 3.6 million shares of $264 million. As it relates to our longer-term capital allocation strategy, we continue to operate from a position of strength with underlying strong organic growth in each of our businesses. With the growth and margin profile we have today, our hurdle rate to achieve accretion is notably higher than in years past. In addition, we want to make clear that while we are now open to looking at transactions that could be slightly larger, these are by no means the only targets in our funnel. We are prioritizing the right deals not necessarily larger deals and continue to be active, diligent, and patient. Now let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2023. For the full-year fiscal 2023, we are again increasing our guidance at midpoints and expect total revenue in the range of $3.995 billion to $4.035 billion and EPS of $3.87 to $3.94. With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance implies revenue of $910 million to $950 million and EPS of $0.80 to $0.87 for our fiscal fourth quarter. With respect to foreign exchange, we are assuming an FX headwind of slightly less than $40 million for the full-year, a marginal improvement compared to our previous guidance. Turning to our divisions. We want to reiterate that each business should grow double-digits in our fiscal 2023, excluding the impact of COVID. However, it is important to remember that 2023 is a unique fiscal year. As a reminder, part of our elevated growth this year has been due to weak comps from supply chain headwinds and COVID's impact on procedural volumes in fiscal 2022. In addition, 2023 is a 53-week fiscal year. Therefore, as we move closer to our fiscal 2024, as Steve discussed, it is appropriate to model our base business revenue growth within our previously outlined 5% to 7% long-term range. Reinforce Steve's comments, this growth is even more impressive than when we introduced the target given our recent base business outperformance and headwinds from the macro environment. Starting with Diagnostics. We expect to close out the year with another strong quarter led by molecular. Our growth continues to be driven by improving utilization and menu expansion on Panther, coupled with increasing contribution from Biotheranostics. Closing out non-COVID diagnostics, we expect blood revenue approximately $35 million for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $10 million in our fourth quarter of 2023 and slightly more than $235 million for the full-year. COVID related items are expected to be slightly more than $25 million in the fourth quarter and slightly less than $120 million for the full-year. As we look forward with COVID testing revenue, demand and public concern for the disease continue to abate. Therefore, although we plan financially conservative in our COVID estimates, areas of significant upside to our COVID guidance are likely in the rearview mirror. It is also key to recognize that COVID is an accretive product and therefore, as COVID testing revenue shift lower in the next several quarters, this will represent a headwind to margins. Moving to Breast Health. In Q4, we anticipate similar performance to Q3, delivering double-digit revenue growth aided by strong demand as weak comps in the prior period, as well as weak comps in prior periods. Finally, in Surgical, we expect healthy double-digit growth for the full-year, but assume growth rates will start to moderate in Q4 given the elevated comparable period revenue we generated in the prior year. Moving down to P&L. For the full-year, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the low 60s and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Within this operating margin profile, we have again incorporated temporary elevated cost pressures in our guidance. On this point, we remind everyone that our elevated cost profile is less related to current movements in spot prices, which have been receiving. For example, one of the primary drivers of our higher assumed costs is semiconductor chips, we have previously procured at higher prices. As we work down our backlog in Breast Health, we'll see this higher cost amortized through the P&L over the next several quarters and persist into our fiscal 2024. We continue to work down the P&L. We expect operating expenses in Q4 to be relatively flat compared to Q3. Below operating income, we assume that other income net to be an expense of slightly more than $10 million in Q4. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $249 million for the full-year. To conclude, our strong third quarter results highlights a durable business that is poised to sustainably grow over the long-term. Our growth in the quarter was diverse, with each business again growing double-digits organically, excluding COVID. As we close out our fiscal 2023 and look to 2024, we are excited about the unique growth drivers in each of our franchises and the optionality provided by our pristine balance sheet. Our stakeholders can count on Hologic to deliver against our financial commitments, while also advancing the global state of women's health. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Steve, maybe we can start on the molecular side, obviously, started to come up against some more difficult comps here. You guys have put up some good numbers. Can you just talk about the underlying performance here? I know you've called out a few growth assays, the Panther usage on non-COVID assays a bit. Any metrics? I know you guys don't want to talk utilization anymore, but any metrics you can point to just in terms of the future growth, obviously a big contributor to that 5% to 7% next year as well, I'm sure. I just wanted to dive into that a little bit? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think the big piece. We've got, obviously the core women's health menu continues to do well. And I think what keeps getting not fully appreciated, Patrick, is all those additional Panthers we placed during COVID. We kept saying many of those are going to be adopting our new menu, and that's exactly what we're seeing playing out. So the core women's health menu, frankly, some of the virals especially outside the United States, and then the new products, the organic growth of BV/CV, which has really just been off to a tremendous start. And while that's not going to exactly replace COVID, certainly not at its peak, it rapidly will become one of the largest assays we've ever developed organically. So I think we just keep seeing tremendous growth for really years to come as they keep ramping up. Karleen? Karleen Oberton : Yes. And I would just add that, Biotheranostics continues to be a strong double-digit grower contributing to the molecular performance. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. [indiscernible]. Patrick Donnelly : Okay, that's helpful. Yes. And then, Karleen, maybe one on the margins. You talked a little bit about some of the headwinds, whether it's pandemic COVID or the chip cost. Second half, I think the second half is 28% and change in terms of the op margins. I believe the Street is almost 31% next year. So what's the right way to think about just the cadence as we work our way into next year. You obviously talked a little bit about the growth, but on that margin side, do some of those headwinds alleviate or should we be resetting next year a little closer to what we're seeing the exit rate at here on the margin side? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So a couple of comments. First, we haven't provided guidance for fiscal '24, and we're not doing that on this call. I would say that what we're seeing here in Q3 and Q4 for operating margins in that 29% range are probably the trough of the low, and we do expect margins to improve over the course of '24. Again, we haven't given that exact percentage, but would expect them to improve from here as some of the inflationary pressures do abate over time. Operator : We will take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Michael Matson : Yes. Thanks. Let's see here. So I guess just starting with the comments on China and Russia, maybe you can provide a little more detail there. Can you talk about, I guess Russia exposure? How much is that? Is that going to zero because of the latest sanctions? And then China, do you think there's kind of a longer-term slowdown in your business there? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, Mike, I think Russia for us was really opportunistic. When we developed our strat plan, we went to the 5% to 7%. We were virtually nonexistent in Russia, but we had big plans to expand. So the good part is we're not losing business. It's really the lack of the opportunity and the upside. China, frankly, we're pretty happy that only 2% to 3% of our revenue comes from China right now given all of the issues going on there. So again, I think we've been able to weather that storm reasonably well. And again, it's just not going to be the growth that we would have expected. So I think that the higher way to think about this is when we put out the 5% to 7%, we saw China and Russia becoming clearly accretive to that. They're now -- Russia is effectively flatlined at zero, and China is not the headwind or the tailwind that we had hoped. So what it really means is our core businesses and our core geographies are growing even faster than what we had originally modeled at that time. Michael Matson : Okay. And just in terms of your operating margin, I have to go back pretty far because of the Aesthetics deal, but I think it was like '20 -- fiscal 2016, it was kind of in the 33% to 34% range. Is there any reason in the longer term that you can't get back to those levels and that decline from the kind of low 30s to the high 20s that you're at now. Obviously, we have COVID in between, but I mean, is that decline for the kind of non-COVID business really all due to inflation? Or are there other factors? Because the business mix didn't really look that different back then. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So I'll tackle this with a couple of points. So one, from earnings growth. If we talk about the 5% to 7% top line, we ground ourselves in growing EPS faster than that and likely in that double-digit, low double-digit range. If we want to ground ourselves in operating margins, we point you to Q2 '20, which was 31.5%. I think compared -- going back to 2016, I think the business is a little more diversified and probably a growing business outside the U.S. compared to 2016. So as we know, OUS has been growing double digits on the top line, but there is kind of diluted from the total margin perspective. And then as we kind of move out of 2030 into '24, as I talked about, it looks like this back half of '23 is kind of the low point of the 29%. We would expect continuing improvement into '24 as higher costs on the semiconductor as well as other higher inflationary pressures such as freight continue to abate over the course of the year. So I think what we try to manage, again, growing EPS low double-digit and still investing in things like R&D and marketing initiatives to grow the top line, not exactly driving to that historical operating margin percentage. Operator : We will take our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon. Stephen MacMillan : Hi, Jack. Jack Meehan : Steve, so the number one question I've been getting on Hologic is actually related to Illumina. So I was wondering if you could just share some brief thoughts on your decision to join as Chairman there and just comment on your ongoing commitment to Hologic as Chairman and CEO? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, sure. Let's be really clear. I'm at Hologic through the end of my useful life in terms of what I've worked for, built for. And as a reminder to everybody, I am personally a top 15 shareholder in Hologic. So this is my day job. This is my passion. This is my love. What I have to see is the company five minutes away, that's troubled that I thought, frankly, I could also help out in a different role, which is as Chairman of the Board. And I'm very proud that I think I can do both. If I didn't have the great team around me at Hologic wouldn't be able to. Frankly, over there, it's going to be about also just getting a great CEO in place. And we're making a couple of key decisions there, which are probably pretty obvious. And then it's going to be a normal Chairmanship from there. So this is my love and my passion and frankly, where I'm fully engaged sometimes more than my teams would like. Karleen Oberton : I would add. Jack, that last week, we had all the teams together for our quarterly business reviews and Steve was as engaged as ever. Stephen MacMillan : I want to add\u2026 Jack Meehan : I love it. That's what I want to hear. Sounds good. Okay. And then another question, I think get a lot from investors is just on guidelines as it pertains to co-testing. So it was good to see the strong cytology quarter, but I was just hoping you could share your latest thinking on the USPSTF. If you have a sense for when some update might come on cervical cancer screening and how -- just latest thinking on how that may or may not impact the business? Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Yes, Jack, I think the interesting stuff on the USPSTF guidelines, as they relook at cervical cancer screening, is we don't have an exact time line. It could be months from now. It could be any time, could be late this year, early next. You're never quite sure where that plays out. I think the biggest piece, the way I look at all of this is there's the headline the day any of those guidelines, whether it's breast cancer or cervical cancer screening guidelines get tweaked. And then there's the reality of how it plays out in the marketplace with the physicians. And I think just as when USPSTF raised the age of Mammography years ago and said, women should really wait until they're 50 instead of 40 and you have those kind of shifts, medical practice didn't change that much. And now when they reversed it and came back to 40 just like that, it's not going to dramatically change because it never changed that much in the first place. We think that is very true as well in cervical cancer. The Pap test has truly been one of the gold standards, as we've said, probably has had more impact on women's health and changing cervical cancer from one of the number one killers of women to going way down the food chain in terms of that because of how well it's been -- how well it's performed over time. And so while not necessarily the greatest procedure for somebody to have to have. It has worked out incredibly well over time, and we think it's going to continue to be strong. So it will be a little headline stuff. We still hope that, frankly, patient groups and the medical community's opinions will properly be listened to. And then frankly, the guideline shouldn't change much. But even if they do, I think very little impact to our business over certainly a several year period. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hi, Steve, thanks for taking my questions. Steve, so maybe my first one on -- just so I understand this fiscal '24 commentary, what you're saying is the base business, ex-COVID should be 5% to 7%, inclusive of headwinds. Are Russia and China headwinds to fiscal '24, if they are, could you perhaps give some color on how much of a headwind there are. And when you give that 5% to 7%, should we be perhaps thinking about the bottom half just given some of the macro commentaries you made? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. The 5% to 7% as we related it to Russia and China, which I answered earlier is they're basically like Russia is just a lack of growth opportunity. So it's not a headwind -- yes, it's not an headwind. It's just the lack of what could have been a tailwind in our strat plan. So I think we feel very good about being in that range. We'll give guidance on our November call. Vijay Kumar : Sorry, is China a headwind, Steve, for next year? Stephen MacMillan : Not additionally to this year, in our minds probably. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Understood. Stephen MacMillan : We feel very good. I think the gist that we keep trying to say here is we feel better and better about the growth of our base businesses in all of our core geographies today. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Karleen, one for you. Gross margin here sequentially came down. You're talking about inventories flowing through the P&L. So it looks like this could flow through to the first half of next year. Are we -- just given the P&L dynamics, is there some cost controls, any offsets to this at the OpEx line item? Or how should we think about margins? Should we be expecting any expansion next year? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So I think as I had -- if you go from Q2 to Q3, the gross margin declines primarily lower COVID revenue. So again, we had over $70 million of COVID assay revenue in Q2 and just under $30 million here in Q3. So that's probably the bigger as well as lower gantry revenue, which our gantries in our Breast Health business, their gross margins are accretive to the corporate average. So that explains the sequential. As I had talked about operating margins, we feel that here in the second half of '23, this roughly 29% operating margin is probably the low point and as we move through '24, we should see improvement as we have on revenue growth in the base business, but also some of those headwinds on higher costs will abate over the course of the year. And again, we'll give guidance on the November call. Operator : We will take our next question from Tim Daley with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Timothy Daley : Great, thanks. So Steve, in the prepared remarks, you called out tough comps along with macro factors is the reason for not raising the long-term growth outlook. So just hoping to get a bit more color on this dynamic specifically to breast. I think the guidance gets to around $350 million or so for the fourth quarter. And just curious if that's like a clean run rate for quarterly revenues to think about? Or is that still impacted by the chips on the high end or maybe backlog work down on, I guess on the upside case. Just curious about how we should kind of think about that moving forward as kind of a clean quarterly number we can grow from? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I would say it's not an unreasonable number. It's probably still a little low from historical levels. I think prior to the chip supply headwind, we would, in each quarter do roughly 1,100 to 1,200 gantries a quarter. This is below that level seemed in Q3 and Q4. I think as we look into '24, I think we're still having recovery in the breast business as we believe our backlog will be worked through over the course of '24. Timothy Daley : All right. Helpful. And then just wanted to touch on Mobidiag. So the write-down equated to nearly a quarter of the acquisition price just rough calculations. So can you give us an update on either, I guess, how the European dynamics are going? Or any update on the USA launch time line of Novo [ph]? Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think overall, as you know, we did about six acquisitions in COVID time, feeling really good that certainly five of them are delivering good growth for us right now. Mobi is just a little more work, frankly, to get it to the U.S. market. As we dug in deeper, a little more redesign is required of both the cartridge and the machine and what we got. We still like the technology. But as we dug in, it's just going to be further out, and that just affected the cash flows, combined with the interest rates and all of that. But we still are very excited about what that will bring. And frankly, the positive is in a weird way, it's going to hit a little later in our strat plan horizon, and the growth for the next few years looks so good anyway, but it will come in at a really good time for us. Operator : We will take our next question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Tejas Savant : Hey guys. Good evening and thanks for the time. So Steve, Jack stole my question on your side hustles becoming your full-time hustles. And I'm glad to hear you stay at the Hologic. My question is maybe one on M&A. I know you guys sort of mentioned being open to deals of all sizes in your prepared remarks. And I think Karleen called out the tuck-in pipeline also being pretty active here. But any color you can share on the pipeline for those larger needle-moving assets and on a related note, you've called out the success you've had in Biotheranostics, a bunch over the last few quarters. Could that be a precursor for us seeing you making a bigger push in cancer testing, perhaps not sort of the NGS-based testing that people often think about, but like PCR-based approaches? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, Tejas, I think the way to think about our M&A strategy right now and Karleen and I have been out with some of our largest shareholders over the last month-ish, and I think they've all reminded us that as you look at our fundamental growth rate and our margin profile, reminding us that, that alone looks pretty damn good. And it's hard to find deals that are really going to enhance either our growth rate as it's accelerated or our margin structure. And so we are being cautious. And I would tell you, I think it's the beauty of a strong base business, so we are looking in those areas, but we sort of have that luxury right now of time on our side because of the base performance. So more likely to just stay more cautious here, continuing to drive the good deals that we've done. Obviously, with the Biotheranostics in the portfolio, it opens up the aperture to look at certain things, but nothing wildly dilutive by any stretch. And I think we like things that already have a little bit of an established revenue base like a Biotheranostics that we can then turbocharge with our operational efficiencies and our sales forces and our marketing in those areas. So I think it will be in those areas. Tejas Savant : Got it. Makes sense. And then a quick follow-up on GYN Surg. Any updates there on the hospital staffing situation just on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And you talked about sort of that low double-digit growth moderating here in fiscal '24. I mean outside of tough comps, is there anything else to be thinking about? I think, Steve, in the past, you've talked about I think it was almost a quarter of that portfolio is now outside of MyoSure and NovaSure. And presumably, that's growing better than 7% for you guys. So just curious as to any color you can share there. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think clearly, we figure there's probably earlier this year, some catch-up in procedures, this and that. But overall, I think there's still some of that to come. Hospital staffing is clearly tight. But I think in general, the hospitals are figuring out how to manage that. We're figuring out how to manage it and help again as, frankly, so many of our products add efficiencies, including things like Fluent. And so we're really kind of a go-to partner for the hospitals, and I think just feel really good about having both a -- now a laparoscopic portfolio in addition to the hysteroscopic. Karleen Oberton : Yes. I would just add on the Surgical business. We've really seen probably over the last four or five, six quarters, international turbocharge for the Surgical business, a small base, but really starting to take traction. Operator : We will take our next question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda : Steve. Thanks for taking the questions. Stephen MacMillan : Thanks, Puneet. Puneet Souda : Hey, great. Thanks. So first on Panther utilization. It's talked about quite a bit, and I know you've given percentages for customers that are using two tests versus three tests. But wondering what you're seeing today versus a year ago in terms of customers? Are they -- are certain customers that are using it more aggressively versus those that are not? Maybe just help us sort of understand the landscape out there in reference labs versus hospital labs. Where are you seeing some of the more utilization? Because I totally understand some of those percentage numbers that you provided in the past, those are average. But -- just trying to get a bit more color on where you stand today because this is more of a cleaner picture for utilization at this point in time past COVID. Stephen MacMillan : It's pretty broad-based between both our hospital customers, the smaller labs and the big labs. It's remarkably broad-based and also in terms of the menu and increasingly the geographic footprint that so many of the Panthers we placed during COVID were also international. And so we're seeing that as well. So it's hard to fully -- it's not like we can sit there and say, hey, 50% of the additional has come from a few customers or just an area. It's really remarkably broad-based. Puneet Souda : Okay. Thanks. Good to hear. And if one -- if I may ask a bit of a broader question, this is regarding AI, you talked a little bit about it. Just given the some momentum that we're seeing in MedTech essentially for AI technologies. Just trying to understand how do you expect to utilize AI, where does AI augment Hologic's product. Maybe just walk us through a bit. Obviously, there's quite a bit of discussion out there on AI. So I just want to get a sense of how Hologic is looking at that? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think the simplest thing is we've had a number of -- I go back to when we refer to really things as machine learning. When you think about both cytology as well as breast, a lot of it is pattern recognition. And that's what the technology that underlies some of the computer-rated design programs that we've got within our Mammography system, but also our digital cytology that's now been approved in -- basically EC mark or got the mark for the EU. And we're working to get that cleared by FDA as well in the United States. Again, it's pattern recognition. And doing the same thing really within the Breast Health space. And I think it's where our installed base, our knowledge, just the sheer sample size is big. There's a lot of complexities, clearly in terms of getting them through the agency and owning the data to be able to get some of those. But I think we feel really good about the partnerships that we've been able to get and our ability to play strong roles, particularly in those two areas. Karleen Oberton : Yes. I would just add that we're also, even in our field service organization, using predictive analytics to predict certain part failures that allow us to coordinate with our customers to prevent unscheduled downtime, unscheduled visits, which is great for the customers and creates operational efficiency for us. Stephen MacMillan : Thanks, Puneet. Operator : We will take our next question from Anthony Petrone with the Mizuho Group. Please go ahead. Anthony Petrone : Thanks. And maybe a high-level one, Steve, and then a modeling question for Karleen. Maybe, Steve, you mentioned aspirational top line, 7% to 9%, but you called out macro headwinds to some extent here, both just geographically as well as operational to some of the businesses. If those were not there, is it feasible that the profile is a low double-digit sustainable year, right? The organic profile has been there, excluding COVID. So just maybe thoughts on if we didn't have some of these headwinds here, how could it have settled out in the next two to three years? And then I'll have a follow-up for Karleen on the model. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. Anthony, I'd like to correct you. There was no reference at all of an aspirational number. We feel really good about the 5% to 7%. This year, we are delivering double that, is what we said, but we feel great about the 5% to 7% in this environment to be a company and people can count on for that. Anthony Petrone : That's helpful. And then Karleen, maybe just couple of quick ones on the model. Can you give us an idea of what the Breast Health backlog recapture was in the quarter? And then when we think about earnings growth, do you need lower nonoperational costs to achieve the low double-digit earnings profile? Thanks again. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So we haven't given specifics on backlog recapture. I think what we have said is that the backlog continues to be high. It's something that will work through over several quarters to come. I think we're always looking at operational efficiencies to drive earnings results. As I think about '24, I think we'll kind of hit the whole P&L between higher revenue growth, probably some improvement at gross margins and always looking at how do we best manage our operating expenses to deliver that earnings growth. Operator : We will take our next question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Please go ahead. Ryan Zimmerman : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in on the questions here. I'll try and keep it as tight as I can. Just a quick point of clarification. If you look at next year's revenue growth, I think the Street is looking at about 4.1%. And it's like 3.7% organic. So is it unreasonable to think that we would be below your long-term guidance in capacity. Again, I appreciate what you said about the 5% to 7%, but I just want to make sure the Street is clear that at the low end, 5% to 7% or 5%, excuse me, is the right number relative to kind of where the Street is at today? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. We kind of run our business as opposed to the Street estimates. My hunch is there's a lot more COVID still in people's numbers for next year. I think what we feel really good about is the base. Ryan Zimmerman : Okay. All right. I appreciate that, Steve. And then one last one for me. Talked about M&A, we're mostly focused on diagnostics, but I'm a simple MedTech analyst. You're doing well in Bolder, you're doing well in laparoscopic. But help us understand, I mean, with all the shift to robotic surgery, particularly in women's health, I mean is your aperture beyond, say a laparoscopic tuck-in in that arena? I mean, is it unreasonable to think that there are robotic technologies that could one day make it into Hologic's portfolio on the GYN Surgical side? Stephen MacMillan : We're looking at our Surgical business, both within the GYN world, but also things like Bolder have kind of gotten us into thinking about sort of more specialty surgery because it's getting us into pediatrics in addition to traditional guidance. So I think we're opening our aperture and to your point is understanding the MedTech world way, I think about our company right now is we're able to generate a lot of cash flow out of Diagnostics or MedTech and the ability to spend it where it could possibly give the better return as we've done with things like Bolder and MedTech. There'll probably be some other areas in that space that we will be looking at, whether -- and robotics is a piece. But frankly, they've spent a lot of money chasing robotics right now. That's also -- every once in a while that reminds me a little bit of some of the NIPT spaces or other things. So we're going to continue to be looking for where the profits can be generated. Operator : We will take our next question from Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Andrew Cooper : Hey everybody. Thanks for the questions. I know we're at the end here. So I'll try to be quick. Maybe just one on sort of the chip supply and the visibility here. I fully understand you're not going to guide for '24 at this point. But when you sit here today on July 31 versus a quarter ago or a couple of quarters ago when you think about how comfortable you are in out quarters. Can you just give us a sense for sort of where you are from that visibility perspective, what you're hearing from the suppliers and how we should think about maybe the trajectory there and the sustainability of that backlog work down, over the course of the end of this year and next year? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, we're incredibly comfortable with where we stand right now on the chip supply. So feel really good. Karleen Oberton : Yes, we've deepened our business. Andrew Cooper : Is that safe to assume that, that translates to getting the allocations that you are looking for? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. Yes. Andrew Cooper : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Brackmann with William Blair. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. So we'll take this question and one more to close out the call for today. Andrew Brackmann : Okay. Thanks. I'll keep it to one. But maybe just going back to Jack's question around USPSTF for cervical cancer guidelines. Steve, you mentioned Mammography guidelines. But I believe ACS updated their recommendations a few years ago, maybe just in the spirit of giving investors' confidence around whatever USPSTF said. Can you maybe just sort of talk about what you saw in the market following that decision, what you saw sort of from customers and their utilization patterns? Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think all of these changes create headline -- much more headline noise that I know investors look at. I go back to even recently, was it in May when the new Breast Health guidelines came out. And our stock moves like 7% in 20 minutes. At the end of the day, these things have very little impact one way or the other over the short-term and are really much more -- the way -- I've been in health care now for about, 30-plus years, moves happen glacially. And even as any of these guidelines change, they get the headlines, but the reality in practice is very minimal slow changes. Final question. Andrew Brackmann : Thanks. Operator : We'll take our final question from Liza Garcia with UBS. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Garcia : Thanks so much for squeezing me in guys. Really appreciate it. Stephen MacMillan : It is pleasure. Elizabeth Garcia : Great. Just to kind of quickly touch on [indiscernible] since I know that. I just wanted to make sure I caught Steve comments that we're working through the backlog through fiscal 2024 and possibly beyond -- and just to kind of get some context, if that's correct, what could be the beyond factors and how to kind of think about that. And then if I could just parlay that into a bigger and broader modeling question since I know that now the 2024, but just to think about the long-term algo maybe and to think about segment mix and margins and how to think about that as we think about our models more broadly? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, I think the big picture question on the backlog is, I think we'll -- as we currently look we've got pretty much a years-plus worth of backlog, and we'll continue to get more orders in the meantime. So that will keep pushing that backlog well out. So that's the highest level piece. And I'll hand the harder part of that question over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So I think when we think about the long-term growth rate, we talked about the 5% to 7%, we've talked about that all the divisions on a worldwide basis would be in that range and think about Breast Health kind to the lower end of the range, Diagnostics and Surgical to the higher end of the range. And as we talked about earlier, Molecular potentially even above that. So again, we feel good about all the businesses being in that growth range. We continue to see international being a bigger piece of the business growing faster than the U.S. And as I've talked about previously, we haven't given guidance for '24, but we believe that we're hitting the low mark of margins here at the back half of '23, and we'll see improvements as we work through that backlog and some of the inflationary pressures subside. Elizabeth Garcia : Great. Thanks. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. And this now concludes Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cynthia and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations to begin the call. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Simon : Thank you, Cynthia. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. With me Today is Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Pfficer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer, is currently on bereavement and will not be joining us today. Karleen is with family and I will be covering for her on our call. Please join me in wishing Karleen and her family well. Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them, as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor Statement included in our earnings release and SEC filing. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are : one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding divested businesses and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year; and two, organic revenue excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19, and sales from discontinued products in diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic CEO. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. And before I get started, I just want to do a quick shout out to Karleen and her family and let everybody know our thoughts and prayers are with her today. We are pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Total revenue was $945.3 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.89. It was another strong quarter overall with revenue finishing at the high end of our range and EPS exceeding our guidance. Our fourth quarter capped off a tremendous year where we continued our track record of success, strengthened our business, and delivered on our commitments. For the full year, we posted $4.03 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $3.96. In 2023, quite frankly, we delivered some pretty exceptional organic growth rates, which were far above our longer-term targets. At the start of the year, we committed to deliver low double-digit growth across each division. In the end, we delivered more, growing annual organic revenue ex-COVID in the mid-teens at 15.6%, with every division growing north of 13% and international growth just above 20%. Despite various macro challenges, like clockwork, we continued to deliver, raising our financial guidance throughout the year and living up to our commitments. At the same time, our balance sheet remains incredibly strong and we have the financial flexibility to grow our business for the long term. For fiscal 2024, we are confident in our ability to deliver against our 5% to 7% ex-COVID long-term organic growth target, even against significant comps, one less selling week, and a challenging macro environment. In fact, if we look at 2024 on an adjusted daily sales basis, our annual organic revenue growth rate, excluding COVID, is projected to be in the 6% to 8% range. Whether adjusting for selling days or not, we believe our results will truly stand out from the crowd as we progress throughout fiscal 2024, particularly following a year of almost 16% growth ex-COVID in 2023. Before sharing more of our excitement for 2024, we will first reflect on our Q4 results. In Q4, we grew total organic revenue, excluding COVID, 16.7%, with double-digit growth in every division. We again delivered on our promises. At the division level, breast health grew 27.4%, driven primarily by the recovery in our gantry business. Interventional breast also posted a strong quarter, growing in the low double digits. We are pleased the division's gantry recovery is tracking to our expectations, following the industry's chip supply challenges. Moving on to diagnostics. Organic growth ex-COVID was 10.2%, again driven by our strong molecular business. Organic molecular diagnostics ex-COVID grew 15% for the quarter. Driven once again by strong contributions from BV, CV/TV, Amgen, and Biotheranostics. With fiscal 2023 revenue ex-COVID at $1.48 billion, our diagnostics business is over 40% larger than it was in 2019. Even more impressive, our base molecular business is now nearly 80%, eight zero percent larger than it was pre-pandemic. Molecular has grown through a combination of more than doubling our Panther installed base, adding new menu, gaining new customers, as well as acquisitions into adjacent markets. This transformation and durable performance speaks to the ongoing success of our growth strategy. Rounding out the divisions, surgical revenue at over $600 million in fiscal 2023 is now nearly 40% larger than what it was in 2019. In Q4, surgical grew 10.6%, driven primarily by MyoSure and Fluent, both growing double digits. In addition, our laparoscopic portfolio also grew double digits, albeit smaller in dollars compared to MyoSure and Fluent. More importantly, we are pleased our laparoscopic portfolio continues to gain traction. To close the overview of our quarterly results and fiscal 2023 highlights, our international business continue to be accretive to overall growth rates, growing north of 28% on an organic ex-COVID basis in Q4. We expect international to continue to be a key part of our growth story. Before moving on, I'd like to revisit and reinforce our capital allocation strategy. In short, our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We continue to prioritize M&A opportunities; and second, we consistently look to utilize cash towards share repurchases. And we continue to be patient. Having said that, we have recently seen the opportunity to deploy our cash balance more significantly, taking the following four actions. One, in Q4 2023 we deployed $238 million of capital to buy back 3.2 million shares. Second, in our current fiscal Q1 2024, we have already repurchased another 2.2 million shares for $150 million. Three, today we announced an additional $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. And four, we recently paid down $250 million of higher variable interest rate debt. Ryan will expand on both the ASR and debt repayment in his remarks. Looking back four plus years since the start of the pandemic, the biggest acquisition we have made is of ourselves. During this period, we deployed over $1.4 billion on M&A opportunities and nearly $2.3 billion on share repurchases, including our recent repurchases in Q1 2024. And today's ASR announcement will make that $2.8 billion. As you can see, we are very confident in our position for the years ahead. Rounding out our capital allocation discussion. To ensure we are optimized for the future, we carefully evaluate our portfolio on an ongoing basis. As a result, as mentioned in our release, we have recently divested our small SSI ultrasound business. Shifting gears, as we have shared on prior calls, we have broadly transformed our business and strengthened our fundamentals. Quarter-by-quarter, year-by-year, with macro hurdles ever present, we continue to prove our strength. Today, we are effectively a new Hologic, retooled and recapitalized with strong brands, wide modes, industry-leading margins, and the strongest, deepest leadership team we've ever had. Hologic is a differentiated and more competitive company than at any time in our 38-year history. At our core, we are fundamentally guided by our purpose, passion, and promise. Our purpose, to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day. Our passion, to champion women's health globally. And our promise, the science of sure, to provide health care professionals with clinically differentiated, high quality products. Across each division, we have distinct advantages created by our unique focus on elevating women's health through innovative products and trailblazing social initiatives like the Hologic Global Women's Health Index. We ultimately develop our leading positions by leaning into our purpose and proactively meeting our customers' and patients' needs. We will highlight three examples today. First, we are not only leaders in women's health, but we are also sector leaders in workflow automation. Our customers continue to deal with challenges, sourcing technicians, and the persistent pressure to efficiently manage costs. As a result, user-friendly systems and efficient workflow solutions are at the top of our customers' expectations. From our Panther instrument to our Brevera breast biopsy and Fluent systems, to name only a few, each product is designed to transform manual, labor-intensive, cumbersome processes into easy to use, dependable, and efficient workflows. Second, the massive footprint and sheer size of our installed bases in diagnostics and breast health provide a strong foundation in today's world. With more than 3,260 Panther instruments installed worldwide and over 10,000 mammography systems installed across the US, we have the opportunity to be integral partners with the laboratories, hospitals, and screening centers we support. For Panther, as customers add more menu and drive incremental volume, our molecular diagnostics business continues to grow, while also becoming more valuable to our customers and more deeply rooted in their operations. The same can be said for our breast health business. Hologic is unique in our ability to support our customers and their patients at each step along the breast care continuum. We differentiate ourselves with our ecosystem of technologies that integrate across a patient's journey, creating a more comfortable patient experience, greater clinical confidence for practitioners, and increased operational efficiencies for our customers. Moving on to our third example, our longstanding brand leadership across multiple product lines in each division, which yields strong, stable margins and steady cash flow generation. We are innovators and leaders in breast and cervical cancer screening, STI testing, abnormal uterine bleeding treatment, and fibroid removal. This is a significant statement given the strong competitors we face in each respective business. Our diversified leadership and scale across our business lines support industry leading margins and cash flow and in turn, we have the ability to further invest and grow our business. Altogether, we are emerging as a premier growth company, differentiated and more competitive, delivering strong growth across each division and international. As the new much stronger Hologic we are today, we consistently deliver and aim to continue to do so. Turning our attention to 2024, I will touch on some of the high-level growth drivers in each business, and Ryan will finish the call with further detail related to next year's guidance. First, in breast health, we expect 2024 to be another strong year of growth. With our gantry backlog remaining elevated compared to historic levels, we have greater visibility into our pipeline, translating to higher confidence in future gantry sales, creating another exciting year for breast health. In diagnostics, as in recent years, molecular will continue to drive growth for the division. We expect our large global Panther install base to continue to add new menu, while also increasing volume for existing assays. In addition, our Biotheranostics business, which we acquired in 2021, is expected to continue delivering double-digit growth, being accretive even to our molecular growth rate. In 2023, Biotheraenostics grew over 30%, and we are still in early innings growing the breast cancer index test. BCI is still the only test recognized by NCCN guidelines and the American Society of Clinical Oncology to predict which patients are likely to benefit from extended adjuvant therapy beyond five years, yet another example of an innovative and differentiated product. In surgical, MyoSure, our Fluent system, and our newer laparoscopic products that we acquired via Boulder and Acessa are projected to continue to drive growth. Internationally, surgical also continues to shine. In 2023, our international surgical growth rate was more than double the US growth rate. Surgical is clearly emerging as a strong and profitable growth driver. To conclude, entering 2024, we are a new and differentiated Hologic. We are bigger, stronger, and more competitive than ever. Our leadership brands, growth drivers across all three divisions, durable margin profile, and strong balance sheet will continue to power us forward. As we look ahead to 2024, we are poised to continue to grow and make an even bigger impact on women's health around the world. With that, let me hand the call over to Ryan. Ryan Simon : Thank you, Steve. And again, good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will touch on our fourth quarter financial results, recap our annual performance for certain items, and end with our fiscal 2024 guidance for Q1 and the full year. We are pleased to close out fiscal 2023 with yet another strong quarter of growth and profitability. In our fourth quarter, total revenue was $945.3 million, and again, we delivered double-digit organic revenue growth, growing 16.7% excluding the impact of COVID. In addition, our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.89, growing 8.5% compared to the prior year despite significantly less COVID testing revenue. For the full year 2023, total revenue was $4.03 billion. Organic ex-COVID revenue grew 15.6% and non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.96. These are exceptional results in what has been an unpredictable operating environment. Now moving to a brief discussion of our divisional revenue. In diagnostics, global revenue of $416.4 million declined 20.6%. However, excluding COVID assay and COVID-related revenues, the division grew 10.2% in the quarter. Performance was again led by molecular diagnostics, growing 15% in the period ex-COVID. For the year, molecular posted very strong global growth of 18.9% ex-COVID. As Steve highlighted, growth continues to be driven by increasing Panther utilization, turbocharged by a much larger install base, and strong performance from biotherapeutics. Moving next to our COVID results, which exceeded our previous guidance. COVID assay revenue in our fourth quarter was $21 million, and COVID-related revenue, inclusive of a small amount of revenue from discontinued products and diagnostics, was $24 million. Staying in diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal business increased 1.3% in our fourth quarter, a solid result following outsized growth in our preceding third quarter due to the timing of certain larger orders. Moving to breast health, total fourth quarter breast health revenue of $352.8 million increased 27.4%. The division's healthy bookings and elevated backlogs provides us excellent visibility to meet customer needs and financial targets in fiscal 2024 and beyond. Continuing next to surgical, fourth quarter revenue of $148 million increased 10.6% compared to the prior year. Surgical's fourth quarter closes out a year in which the business grew a tremendous 15.8% organically, excluding the impact of Boulder in Q1. And finally, in our skeletal business, fourth quarter revenue of $28 million was also strong, increasing 15.9%. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 60.4% was driven by strong performance in our base business. However, this result was partially depressed by certain elevated costs, including higher cost inventory from previously procured semiconductor chips. Moving down the P&L, fourth quarter operating expenses of $303.7 million decreased approximately 8%. This decrease was driven by lower marketing spend in the period compared to the prior year, primarily due to the timing of expenses associated with our WTA partnership. The low operating income, other income represented a gain in our fiscal fourth quarter. We benefited from higher interest rates on our cash balance, driving elevated levels of interest income. In addition, we realized gains on our interest rate hedge, helping to lower interest expense for our floating rate debt. Finally, our tax rate in Q4 was 19.75% as expected. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q4 came in at 28.3% and net margin was 23.2%. As we have previously discussed, we expect operating margin to improve from this level throughout fiscal 2024. Finally, non-GAAP net income finished at $219.3 million, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.89 cents. Moving on from the P&L, cash flow from operations was $258.7 million in the fourth quarter, capping off a year in which we generated over $1 billion in operating cash flow. As Steve outlined, we were actively repurchasing our shares in Q4 2023, as well as the start of Q1 2024. For the full year 2023, we spent $500 million to repurchase 6.8 million shares. Even so, we ended the fourth quarter with $2.7 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net leverage ratio of 0.1 times. Lastly, after the end of our fiscal fourth quarter, we completed one important capital market transaction and intend to enter into another. First, we repaid $250 million of floating rate debt associated with our credit agreement. This debt pay down helps to further protect our balance sheet against the risk of rising interest rates. And second, as Steve mentioned, we continue to bet on ourselves and announce a $500 million ASR, showcasing our resolute belief in the value of our business as we look to benefit from the stock market's underappreciation of our intrinsic value. Now let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year. For our Q1, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $960 million to $985 million and EPS of $0.92 to $0.97. For the full year 2024, our guidance assumes revenue of $3.92 to $4.02 billion and EPS of $3.90 to $4.10. As you reconcile our guidance to your models, we would like to call out three specific items pertaining to full-year total revenue. One, the headwind of four less selling days in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, which is about $40 million. Two, the divestiture of the SSI ultrasound business, about a $20 million headwind. And three, the impact of FX, also about a $20 million headwind. First, with respect to selling days, our fiscal 2023 was a 53 week year. In fiscal 2024, we have four less selling days compared to 2023, specifically within Q1. We estimate the impact of the four less selling days to be a headwind of about 400 basis points to our Q1 results and more than 100 basis points for the full year. Second, regarding the divestiture of the SSI ultrasound business, in the same way we treat revenue from our divested blood screening business, we will be removing ultrasound revenue from both the current and prior year when calculating our organic growth rates in fiscal 2024. This ultrasound revenue was approximately $4.5 million in Q1 2023 and about $20 million for the full fiscal year. For fiscal 2024, we expect immaterial remaining ultrasound revenue of less than $1 million per quarter. And third, in terms of foreign exchange, we are assuming an FX tailwind of approximately $3 million for Q1 and a headwind of about $20 million for the full year. We anticipate the impact of the recently stronger US dollar to be more acutely felt in the back half of our fiscal 2024. Now turning to our divisional guidance. We expect that each base business will grow within our 5% to 7% framework for the full fiscal year at the midpoint. However, this may not be every division, every quarter, due to strong 2023 comps for certain businesses. Starting with core diagnostics, we expect the business to grow within our 5% to 7% long-term targets for the full fiscal year 2024, but likely below this level in Q1. Our first quarter growth rates will be impacted not only by the four extra selling days in the prior year period, but also strong non-COVID respiratory comps. As we plan for fiscal 2024, we are forecasting conservatively for menu items related to flu and RSV. At this point, we do not foresee a respiratory season in the first half of fiscal 2024 that mirrors last year. Closing out our non-COVID diagnostics business, we expect blood revenue of about $8 million in Q1 and about $30 million for the full year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be about $15 million in the first quarter of 2024 and about $40 million for the full year. COVID-related items are expected to be about $30 million in the first quarter and about $105 million for the full year. Moving to breast health, we expect fiscal 2024 to showcase strong demand for our product portfolio as supply chain challenges abate. As a reminder, due to supply chain challenges in the prior year, our growth rate in fiscal Q1 will likely be above trend. Therefore, as we move throughout the year and comps normalize, growth rates may recede. However, total revenue should increase as we begin to work through our elevated backlog. Finally, in surgical, we expect growth rates within our long-term target of 5% to 7% for the full year, but below this level for Q1. In our first quarter of fiscal 2024, surgical will be impacted by the four less selling days as well as the fact that we are lapping a pricing benefit from NovaSure's V5 product line extension. Moving next to margins, we expect a cadence of improvement throughout fiscal 2024 for both gross margin and operating margin as we work through higher costs during the year. For gross margin, we anticipate Q1 levels at approximately 60%, exiting the fiscal year in the low 60s. Similarly, our guidance assumes Q1 operating margins in the high 20s with a Q4 2024 exit rate in the low 30s. Continuing to work down the P&L, we expect Q1 to represent our highest quarter of operating expense in fiscal 2024. This is due to normal seasonal expenses associated with internal global sales meetings to kick off our fiscal year. For the balance of the year, we anticipate quarterly operating expense to be in line with the back half of our fiscal 2023. Below operating income, we estimate fiscal 2024 other income net to be approximately neutral in Q1 and an expense of between $40 million to $60 million for the full year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $239 million for the full year. To conclude, our strong fourth quarter wrapped up a remarkable year for Hologic. As we move to our fiscal 2024, we remain focused on advancing women's health around the world while delivering on our promises and commitments to shareholders, employees, customers, and patients. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda : Hi, Steve. Thanks for taking the questions. And thanks, Ryan, for the details there on financials. If I could ask two of my questions together. We've been getting a number of questions around USPSTF, it's right around the corner. Could you update us on your thoughts for co-testing versus primary at this point. Any change in how it could turn out to be grade A versus grade B? And if you're wondering -- if you're incorporating any of that impact in your 2024 guide. And then second part, Steve, is just with the FDA LDT regulation, do you think it changes the competitive landscape for Panther or for your approved diagnostic platforms? Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Sure, Puneet, let me take those first. USPSTF, we continue to think there's so much focus on this that's quite frankly a very little impact to our business. I'd remind you back in 2018 when the first guidelines were being updated at that point in time. They came out, they were against co-testing. By the time ultimately they came out as official, co-testing was put back in. We continue to feel very good about our business regardless of how they go. They also, obviously people have been focused on them for months and months, thinking they're coming every other day. We think it's a big do about nothing, to be quite candid. I feel great about our business, feel great about the data on co-testing, and feel great that regardless of how they go, the clinicians are going to stick with our business and there's going to be no change to our forecasts. So regarding the LBT thing, I think again, great question. It's part of where I view the strength of our business. First off, I think again that there's so much focus on what I call headline risks. To be clear, the LBT stuff won't come into effect probably until at least 2028. And there's going be issues that are going be battled between now and then, legislatively, everything else, so nothing that's going to impact the business over the next three years, probably the next five. At a bare minimum, however, we love where we're positioned in that most of us with our kidding and as you well know, from a Panther standpoint, it could create more opportunities. So the LBT thing probably creates more opportunity for us than it does risk. Having said that, we really just don't think much is going to happen on that over the next few years. So thanks. We know you probably have another call you want to get to too, Puneet. Puneet Souda : Right. Stephen MacMillan : All right. Operator : We will take our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon. And first, I hope Karleen and family are doing all right. And also Steve, appreciate the commitment to the capital return here to shareholders. I think that's great. I was wondering if you just on the business. [Multiple Speakers] I appreciate it. Okay can we talk about Panther, now that we're at the end of the year, are there any updated utilization stats you can share for the system? And second, the recent placement rates have slowed. I know there was some pull forward on placements that during the pandemic. I was just curious like how long you think this kind of lasts before hospitals and labs start expanding their fleets again. Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Yeah, great. I think the simplest thing on utilization is that our molecular business grew 18.9% last year, which is virtually all increased utilization on the Panthers. And we just love what we've done there. Clearly, as we said even at the start of last year, Panther placements for the next few years may be very small and frankly are almost immaterial to us growing the business, because at this point there were so many machines put out there as you know from everybody, but I think especially from us. Now it's really ramping up the menu with our existing customers. And an increased focus on expanding the Fusion. So I think the magic for us is now that we have so many Panthers installed, we're increasingly going back and getting the fusion sidecar put on, which opens up the PCR assays. And I think we continue to see years and years of growth, just even from the existing installed base, as we're expanding the menu and putting more fusions out there. So, Ryan, did you have anything you wanted to add? Ryan Simon : Yeah, Jack, I'll add to that that our growth as we look forward is not predicated so much on placing additional panthers. This is really what Steve mentioned is, placing more assays on the system, expanding the Fusion footprint, as well as growing the volumes of the assays adopted so far. Stephen MacMillan : And go Eagles. Operator : We will take our next question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Stephen MacMillan : Hey, Derik. Derik De Bruin : Hi, thanks for taking the call. Appreciate it. Just some, you commented on the pricing environment. Can you thought to what your sort of expectations are for pricing this year? And Ryan, just I know you said negative $40 million and negative $60 million expense for other all-in, But what's the interest expense on that, just to help preempt the model? Stephen MacMillan : I'll take the first part and then kick it over to Ryan. In terms of pricing, overall, we're assuming very modest pricing. Most of our gains really are volume, given that a lot of our contracts are already set with very little pricing increase. And I think it's where we're very proud of the fiscal discipline that we've been able to exert. And then getting opportunistic pricing or pricing really as much mix as we launch new products, Derik, but very little of our growth is based on pricing at this point. Ryan Simon : Yeah, and on that second piece, Derik, it's approximately $50 million in expense in that number. When you're looking at it from a high level, like looking at 2023 compared to 2024, the biggest difference there is, we're assuming less cash on the balance sheet going forward. And -- but to answer your question, it's going to be $50 million on that interest expense. Derik De Bruin : Great. I just want to clarify, if I can, the full ASR is embedded into the current guide for EPS? Ryan Simon : Correct. Correct. Correct. Operator : We will take our next question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Steve, maybe one on the breast health side. Obviously, you guys -- you had a bit of a backlog with the supply chain issues last year. Can you just talk about how you're working that down, what goes into the guide this year there? And then a second one, just on the margin piece. Yeah, I know we don't have Karlene, but maybe Ryan, just in terms of the moving pieces, as you think about the 2024 margin build, obviously COVID coming down, some high margin stuff, can you just talk about what you guys are doing to offset that and keep margins moving in the right direction? Thank you, guys. Stephen MacMillan : Great, thanks. First in terms of the breast health business, I think we see clearly placing at least a double-digit increase in gantries this year, both domestically and internationally. We really got going more in our second fiscal quarter last year. So especially this first quarter we'll show much bigger growth for the breast health business. But I think we feel great about being able to continue to place the gantries and just based on the backlog alone, let alone the additional customers were winning. Quick first crack at the margin piece. The way I think about it is before Ryan comes in is, I think they will basically be lower in our first fiscal quarter and then growing through the year as we continue to bleed through the higher cost, especially chips in gantries. And we're also in the midst of relocating some of our manufacturing -- basically our manufacturing for our breast health business from Connecticut down to Delaware. So at the current time, we've got double costs as we do that. And I think we've got great visibility that those gross and operating margins will be improving throughout the year. I don\u2019t know if you want to add more to that. Ryan Simon : Yeah, sure, Steve. So as we previously called out Q3, Q4, our expectation is that would be the trough with respect to operating margins. And as Steve mentioned, our expectation is to work up from there to the low 30s as an exit rate in 2024. Steve pointed to the fact that we're working past and farther away from the highest cost chips. Our breast business is also recovering, which is going to be a tailwind to margins as well. We did mention that we divested the SSI business, and that will also be a tailwind to margins as we go into 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, team. This is Madison on for Tejas. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just firstly, I was wondering if you could elaborate on how you're thinking about international growth for 2024? I know you flagged the under-indexation to China as an advantage in the near term, but what's your combined exposure to China and the Middle East. And should any of that ongoing conflict weigh on the demand throughout the latter part of the Middle East region? Stephen MacMillan : Sure, we have very little in the Middle East, and China is 2%. So between the two, it's call it 2% to 3%, really. So I think we love that from the current environment. And as it relates to international overall, I think we've continued to see our international business as being clearly accretive to the growth rates of the company. And really over the last number of years, it's been a double-digit grower and wouldn't count out that it couldn't do that again this year. So we've strengthened our international businesses significantly over time. Our breast health business getting stronger. Diagnostics has benefited hugely from all the additional Panther placements. So that's been growing tremendously internationally. And our surgical business after years of trying to work on reimbursement and getting products approved is really also starting to take off internationally as we said, a real nice grower here over last year. So I think we see all three franchises being in very good shape to grow here in 2024. Operator : We will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, this is Kevin on for Vijay. Just a clarifying question on the 4% to 7% base organic guidance for the full year. Does this include or exclude the four selling days impact, meaning excluding the impact would guide the 5% to 8%? Stephen MacMillan : You got it exactly. Yes, we factored that in. So that's why it's actually -- yes, it's 5% to a little north of 8%. Ryan Simon : And just a reminder that is ex-COVID. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. So just to follow up, if the guide excludes day's impact, why is the lower end of \u2013 Stephen MacMillan : No, it includes the day. The 4 to 7 is including, just to clarify. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, got it. And just to follow up then, you also highlighted new share repurchasing in fiscal first quarter and an accelerated repurchase program. Is this a change in your capital allocation priorities? It seems like M&A was a focus in previous quarters. Stephen MacMillan : Yeah, as we reiterated, we continue to focus on M&A. Right now we're just having to think that one of the great acquisition opportunities is our own stock where it's priced and we're trying to send that signal very strongly, but we're continuing to look for external M&A as well. But we just love the position we're in. So it's not a change. It's just an extra opportunistic based on where the valuation of ourselves sits right now. Thanks, Kevin. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tim Daley with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Timothy Daley : Great, thanks. So, Steve, following up on the Fusion comments you made to Jack\u2019s question. Could you update us on the percent of the Panther install base currently Fusion enabled at the end of fiscal year 2023? And I guess, or similarly, what were the Fusion sidecar placements in 2023? Stephen MacMillan : What I'll comment on is the current attachment rate and it's about 20% to the Panther install base. Ryan Simon : Yes, and which is growing, but the way we look at it, it doesn't have to be a 100% because the key is we think about it per customer and so that each customer needs enough fusions to be able to deliver what they need for their products, so we've seen very nice growth We're not necessarily disclosing the exact numbers, but I really like the growth there. Okay, got it. Then, breast, just talk about healthy bookings, elevated backlog, great visibility in the 2024. Just, if you're going to help us, how much of the 2024 breast revenue expectations are currently covered in your backlog? Or direct visibility via hard orders? Just curious on the coverage rate for the year versus [Multiple Speakers]. Stephen MacMillan : Think about all of it, actually. If you look at it -- as you'll see in the 10-K, that basically we've got the orders in place for the year. Now we're going to continue to add orders to that for further out periods, but we're in great shape coming into the year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group. Please go ahead. Anthony Petrone : Thanks. Good afternoon. I also send condolences to Karleen and her family. Maybe the first one on Biotheranostics, just up 30% for the full year, and obviously still in the early days, as you mentioned, Steve, in your prepared comments, I'm just wondering when you think about, I guess, the synergy to the breast health business, you have 10,000 gantries out there, and I think there's two call points really for Biotheranostics, OBGYN and then possibly a little bit in radiology specifically. But how should we be thinking about how many of your breast health install base users are currently using biotherapeutics and how long will it take to sort of extract that entire synergy. And then specifically on margins for Ryan, just when we -- that trajectory from high 20s in the first quarter to low 30s, is that linear? Are there certain inflection points throughout the year? If so, what are they? Is it operating leverage or more in pricing at the gross margin line? Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Sure, Anthony. On the first one, it's a great question and I don't have the specifics. I think our Biotheranostics sales team has been out there really focusing on a number of key docs. And so as they're building it up, I do think we back to the early innings, still lots of opportunity to more broaden it with both our breast health as well as even our diagnostics, OBGYN salesforce. So still a lot of opportunity ahead to your point. Ryan Simon : Yes, and Anthony, on the margins as we've stated in the commentary, looking to work up from the high 20s to the low 30s through the course of the year, it should be a relatively consistent trajectory up to that range. As I mentioned on the prior question, breast health recovery is a tailwind to the margins. The farther we get away from the higher-cost chips that are in our gantries as we progress throughout the year, that should be helpful as well. And again, the savings from SSI should be felt in the back half of the year as well. Operator : We'll take our next question from Casey Woodring with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Casey Woodring : Great. Thank you for taking our questions and my condolences to Karleen and her family. So I just wanted to talk about the surgical business. So growth this year is going to be within the LRP range coming off of 16% organic comp in 2023. Can you just talk about some of the growth drivers there? It sounds like international is a big piece of it. It sounds like pricing drove out performance this year as well. So can you just talk about how that business performed this year and the sustainability into next year? And then just one more quickly on the margins. So I think in 2023 you have baked in something around 200 basis points to 250 basis points of inflationary headwinds outside of that higher semi-chip costs. How should we think about that dynamic here in 2024? Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Sure. On the [indiscernible] business, I'd say we had everything working for us in 2023, including the NovaSure V5 launch that did have some pricing associated, really. It showed up more as mixed, but it was a higher priced product. And then I think, frankly, procedures were pretty good. But we fired across all cylinders. NovaSure, MyoSure, Fluent, and then also Boulder and Acessa, and did it both domestically and internationally. I think as we go into next year, MyoSure, Fluent and Boulder and Acessa all continue to look as very good growth. NovaSure will probably be back to flatish to possibly down a touch, but internationally, I think again, we see international being a solid double-digit grower in the year so feeling very good about our positions. I would tell you one of the biggest surprises to me probably over my almost decade now at Hologic has been the continued growth and the sheer scale of MyoSure as it continues to really grow the category. If we think about TAMs, the total available markets, never realized how big it would be and I think we're continuing to expand that market. So feeling very, very good about that. I'll let Ryan take the second part of that. Everybody's decided I can't handle margin questions. So I'll go ahead and let Ryan go ahead and take them. Ryan Simon : Yeah, so I do want to clarify one comment that we made to Derik's question earlier. It is actually $50 million in income and $130 million in expense. So I had flip-flopped that in the prior question. And again, with respect to margins, kind of just reiterating the comments that we've made here, it is an expectation that we are going from, again, the high 20s to the low 30s. The biggest impacting driver, again, is the breast recovery and moving, again, farther away from the higher price chips. Stephen MacMillan : Yeah, I think that's what gives us such confidence in the gross margin expansion to clarify that is, it is looking at the current inventory that's sitting on our balance sheet that is just going to flow through here on a effectively a first in first out basis so we can see those super high-priced chips that we got early and mid in the chip crisis bleeding through the product lines here in the first quarter. Really, by the first two quarters, most of that will be done. And it gives us great confidence as we continue to work through the year. Operator : We will take our next question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Navann Ty : Hi, good afternoon. I just had a follow up on the M&A. Curious to know whether Hologic came across interesting deals since August, and do you see a healthy amount of sub-1 billion deals? Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Thanks, Navann. We continue to scour the landscape. You know, the bankers have been all over the place with lots of ideas. We frankly are in that great position where we can be patient. You know, if I still look at the landscape today, you've got a whole bunch of very smaller companies that went public in COVID time that are hemorrhaging cash and in bad shape. And a lot of those still don't fit our criteria. So then we're looking at other things that may be a little bit more established but the magic that we have for us right now is given our growth rates, given our profitability, we've got a pretty tight hurdle rate that not a lot of things are making it to the top. So I wouldn't expect anything super imminent as we continue to look at the landscape. Navann Ty : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Michael Matson : Yeah, thanks. So I want to ask one about the breast business, specifically the gantries. I guess, during -- when you had all the kind of supply chain issues, you talked about the orders were coming in and remaining strong. And so, and I know you've got a backlog now, but I guess what I'm wondering is, what is the ordering looking like? Because we have seen some kind of mixed signals out there about capital spending at the hospital level. Stephen MacMillan : Yeah, we continue to feel good about it. You know, having been in this chair in a different company in the 2008, 2009 downturn. I'm always particularly attuned to trying to pay attention to concerns about capital freezes or capital tightening. I think we just feel great about where we are both in terms of the products we've already got the orders in, as well as continuing to get new orders. So we're booking candidly out beyond the current year at this stage, and just a lot of excitement still in our breast health business. I think what's hard for people to grasp is how much we've dramatically expanded our installed base to where we're so strong in the US and so many people just still coming to us. So really feeling very good about it. Michael Matson : Okay, got it. And then just on the international business, I mean, it's good to see that the growth is being so strong there. You sound pretty optimistic about the outlook. But, you know, I was wondering if you could maybe just talk about what's really driving the growth there. Is it expanding into new countries? Is it getting new products approved in your existing markets? Is it gaining share in existing markets? Is it maybe all of the above? Stephen MacMillan : Yeah, I'm glad you asked it. I think the magic for us is it is all of the above. It's this incredible diverse growth that in very simple terms, if we actually do look almost country by country and franchise by franchise, and we were just with literally that the sales leaders of each country for each franchise in Dubai a couple of weeks ago. So I'm coming fresh off looking at all the plans. If I look at the UK, we have growth plans for diagnostics, not just diagnostics, but psychology as well as molecular in the UK. We've got plans for the breast health business and we have plans for surgical. And it is, it's bringing -- in the case of surgical, it's bringing those products into these markets. It's getting the reimbursement. And it's just been a lot of nothing sexy and no one big driver, which I actually think creates the excitement. And even as places like China have gotten a lot wonkier for most companies because we're small there, we're not counting on that for our growth. We're getting it everywhere else. But it's not sexy, But it's incredibly effective that it's literally every -- almost every franchise in every geography. And these hundreds of thousands here and there, as you keep adding them up, they become millions and millions and then tens of millions all through it. And I think it's creating this inexorable growth as we're bringing on new customers in each franchise. Thank you, Mike. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Brackmann with William Blair. Please go ahead. Andrew Brackmann : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions and certainly sending condolences to Karleen here. I'll just stick to one on the innovation engine here. You guys have obviously done well sort of advancing the platforms through R&D and new launches, but how should we be thinking about major upgrades within the core franchises here over the next couple of years. Anything to call out there? So we'd be expecting, I guess, more singles and doubles moving forward. Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Sure, Andrew. I think we never want to over-hype anything, but we've got some neat things coming both, particularly organically in the breast health business, you know, diagnostics obviously, BV/CVs off to a tremendous start and, we're excited by that organic thing. And then working it out, but probably more in the continued singles doubles category that, hopefully over time, those singles and doubles turn into triples. I think if you look at Acessa and Boulder, they're growing very nicely, they're still very small. And so over time, I think the magic from where we sit today is we can see those franchises growing at above our company rate for the next five plus years at least. And I think that's the magic of what we have going here. So again, no one kind of back to Mike's question a little bit, no one product driving the growth, it's systematically coming across the product lines. And I think it creates a lot more durability. Andrew Brackmann : Okay. Thanks, guys. Stephen MacMillan : Thanks, Andrew. Ryan Simon : We have time for one more question. Operator : And we will take our final question from Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Andrew Cooper : Hey, thanks guys for squeezing me in. A lot's already been asked. So maybe just one, you mentioned booking out already into next year on the gantry business. Just what is the typical kind of visibility you have at this point looking into the year relative to maybe where you sit now with this big backlog? In other words, how much bigger is that backlog than it typically would be? Stephen MacMillan : Yeah, it's clearly peaked. I think we've peaked up here in the last year, and now we will start to bleed that down. But we typically have reasonable visibility. By the way, it doesn't mean that an order can't be placed now, that we wouldn't ship sometime in the next quarter or so. It all depends on how they're scheduled and everything else. But I think we feel really good about where we sit. Operator : That concludes today's question and answer session. And this now concludes the Hologic fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",

Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are, one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding the divested businesses and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics; finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Steve MacMillan : Thank you, Ryan. And good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.01 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.98. Both revenue and EPS came in above the high end of our guidance. Before diving into our results, it is important to view our Q1 growth performance in proper perspective. Simply put, our first two quarters of fiscal \u201824 face incredibly difficult comps. Despite Q1 \u201824 having four fewer selling days compared to the prior year, and even against a prior year Molecular Diagnostics ex-COVID revenue growth of 24 .5%, and a Surgical revenue growth rate of nearly 15%, we grew total organic revenue, ex-COVID, a solid 5.2%. Even more impressive, when adjusting four fewer selling days, our Q1 results stand taller. On an adjusted basis, we estimate the total company organic revenue growth ex-COVID was in the high single digits for the period. These are incredibly strong results against challenging comps as we continue to perform exceptionally well against our 5% to 7% percent ex-COVID long-term target. We continue to showcase our durability and broad strength across our divisions, both delivering on our short-term guidance and maintaining our long-term targets. Keep in mind that our long-term revenue targets are more impressive today, given we are growing off a much larger base than we originally contemplated. As we've said before, you can count on us to deliver. During our call today, we will focus on building upon our messaging from the JPMorgan conference three weeks ago. During our presentation, we highlighted that we are a new Hologic bigger, faster, stronger, and poised for continued success. As part of our discussion, Essex will share more insights about our high confidence in our future success. He will also shed light on what we view as underappreciated elements of our growth strategy that are helpful to fully recognize the potential of our business. Before then turning the call over to Karleen to discuss our detailed financial results, we will share reflections from our participation at the World Economic Forum in Davos. While we continue to make progress elevating women's health, it is clear we still have a long way to go. Starting with our meetings at JPMorgan, we realize there are two camps of investors. There is one camp that understands our transformation and recognizes the drivers powering our current results and future growth potential. At the same time, there is another camp that, quite frankly, does not. That said, we certainly appreciate the complexity. Over the past three years, there have been many moving pieces clouding the narrative of the force we've become. From revenue still normalizing following the ups and downs of COVID, to moving past semiconductor chip supply challenges, to selling days dynamics, only naming a few, each has contributed to irregular comps that may be difficult to interpret, and also challenging tomorrow. We appreciate that each represents a layer of complexity that must be pulled back to fully appreciate the underlying strength of our business. Looking beyond the quarterly nuances, our steady performance over time really shines. Above all, we are bigger, faster, stronger, and poised for further growth. We are a durable and diversified growth company with disciplined operations, peer group leading margins, an exceptionally strong balance sheet, and above all, a talented and engaged employee workforce. We are poised to continue to drive top-line growth while growing the bottom line even faster. To shed more light on what gives us high confidence in our future, I'll pass it over to Essex. Essex Mitchell : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As we've commented over the past several quarters, we have dramatically transformed our business since 2019 through the challenges of the pandemic. More recently, as we move further away from the peaks of COVID testing and prevalence, we have posted exceptional ex-COVID results. These results back up our claim that we are much more than a COVID story, and without doubt build for the long term. At the same time, as Steve mentioned, there is a lot to unpack to fully understand our business. Many recognize that we are a new Hologic compared to where we were in fiscal 2018. Since then, we've grown our Molecular Diagnostics business approximately 80%, our Breast business nearly 10% and our Surgical business nearly 40%. Yet there are still some on the fence and uncertain of our future growth potential. As some of our peers have also performed well over this time period, it's not easy to see the throughway. The underlying assumption is that winner must be exclusively taking share. In reality, there was much more to it. In addition to competing and taking share, Hologic growth is centered on innovation, and making sure. We then drive this innovation to commercial execution by leveraging our world class sales teams. As we are positioned today, our future growth is much less about hand to hand combat in the trenches of the markets where we operate. Instead, our growth is derived from growing and expanding market through education, awareness, innovative new products, and tapping into under penetrated markets. As an example, our three largest revenue product lines launched in 2019, excluding COVID are BV, CV/TV, Biotheranostics and Fluent. These three lines alone collectively delivered over 300 million in revenue in 2023. That was essentially nonexistent to start 2019. Moreover, each product line falls into one or more of our market creating strategies, and each is still in their earlier stages of growth. Similarly, outside of the top three, we have a number of other product lines and new since 2019 which could each individually represent $100 million revenue opportunities over time. And these lines are also still in their early innings of growth. To highlight a few are respiratory assays, GYN scopes, and laparoscopic surgical portfolio, each delivered to double digit growth rates for fiscal \u201823. On top of our market expansion activity, we continue to drive further growth by leveraging our large installs in user bases of core products in each division. Through the Panther, our gantry and our hysteroscopic surgical portfolio, we have incredibly deep customer relationships in each of our unique channels. Post COVID, our call points around the world are stronger than ever. Customers associate Hologic with industry leading differentiated technologies, ongoing innovation, best-in-class workflow and automation solutions. Moreover, our strong reputation as leaders and champions for Women's Health continues to open doors. Earning this advantage provide us a unique opportunity to supercharge growth from products introduced into our channel. While there are many out there that claim to be winners, even in categories, we continue to lead year-over-year, we are extremely confident in our ability to carve out a great opportunity for growth. Similarly, we are equally confident in our demonstrated ability to gain and maintain market share across our core product lines. With our core businesses, incredibly healthy, and many of our growth driving products still in early innings. All-in, we believe we are well positioned for the future and well positioned to maintain our strong performance for the years to come. Steve? Steve MacMillan : Thank you, Essex. To close out the discussion of our growth prospects. While we continue to make significant progress outside of the US, we still have tremendous opportunity to grow and build a much greater presence internationally. Shifting gears before turning the call over to Karleen, we'd like to share reflections from our time at the World Economic Forum in Davos. For a third year in a row we had the opportunity to participate at the forum, where we presented the results of our third annual Hologic Global Women's Health Index. The Index, which is the largest study of its kind, examining the overall state of women's health and wellbeing continues to generate tremendous support from major organizations dedicated to improving women's health. As we've said before, over time, we believe the Index may be the single greatest contribution to the world that we make at Hologic. This year's results show that we all need to stand behind women more than ever. The harsh reality is that women's health globally has not only stagnated over the past year, but is sadly moving in the wrong direction. The data shows that only 11% of women were screened for cancer and only 10% for STIs. Billions of women are not being screened, this must change. And we have a tremendous opportunity to lead the way with our women's health portfolio. The key takeaway here is that in many ways, our markets are still in the early innings of reaching their potential. As we look ahead, we are even more inspired to live into our purpose, passion, and promise. We continue to believe and we have proven that we can drive results through our unwavering commitment to women's health. Our strong results come from our strong purpose. And finally, in late breaking news, we are incredibly proud to announce that just last night, our new Genius Digital Diagnostic system, with the Genius Cervical AI algorithm received clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration. This accomplishment is only made possible by the creativity, focus and dedication of our outstanding Diagnostics team. Continuing to trailblaze our path. Our system is the first and only FDA cleared digital cytology system that combines deep learning based AI with advanced imaging technology. It can help more accurately detect cervical cancer, improve psychology workflow, and ultimately enhance patient care. We continue to deliver and at a time when women need it most. With that, let me hand the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Steve. And good afternoon, everyone. And congratulations again to our Diagnostics team. In my statements, today, I will provide an overview of our divisional revenue results, and walk down our income statement that highlights the broad based strong performance across our business. I will also touch on a few additional key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal \u201824 in the full year. Jumping right in, we are pleased to share that our first quarter financial performance was strong. We exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line. Total revenue came in at $1.013 billion, beating the midpoint of our guidance by about $40 million. As Steve mentioned, despite four fewer selling days in the quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 5.2% excluding the impact of COVID in line with our long term revenue growth target of 5% to 7%. In addition, non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.98, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Overall, we continue to deliver robust performance on both the top and bottom lines. Before moving to our divisional results, we again want to emphasize that our balance sheet and willingness to deploy capital remain a core strength of our business in a macroenvironment that remains dynamic. As an example, in our first quarter, we initiated a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, we purchased an additional $150 million of our stock and also pay down $250 million of floating rate debt with a cash balance of $1.9 billion, a leverage ratio well below our target range, and roughly $350 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. We have significant firepower and flexibility to deploy further capital should the opportunity arise. Turning to our divisional results. In Diagnostics, first quarter revenue of $447.8 million declined 20.6%. Excluding COVID assay and related ancillary revenue, Diagnostics revenue declined 0.9%. Yet adjusted for selling days we estimate we grew mid-single digits compared to the prior year. As a reminder, Q1 \u201823 was a very strong quarter for Diagnostics, boasting 15.8% growth ex- COVID and Molecular Diagnostics 24.5% growth ex-COVID. And without a doubt, our Q1 \u201824 results were impacted by four fewer selling days compared to the prior year. Within Diagnostics, our molecular business continues to drive the divisions results, it will bring growth of 1.9% ex-COVID or mid to high single digits when adjusted for the impact of fewer selling days. We continue to see underlying strength and BV, CV/TV which grew more than 20% in the quarter, and it's still in its early innings of adoption by our customers. More than 95% of our BV, CV/TV revenue is derived in the US, representing incredible longer term opportunity internationally. In addition, non-COVID respiratory revenue delivered ahead of our expectations. As we experienced stronger than anticipated demand for our flu, RSV, and 4-Plex assays. Our responding with published CDC data on respiratory virus positivity. Sales ramped up and in the final weeks of the quarter. Finally Biotheranostics remains a positive driver of growth for our molecular business, and delivered accretive revenue performance in the period. Now moving to Breast Health, total first quarter revenue of $377.7 million increased 12.2% showcasing solid double digit growth. Demand for our gantries remains robust and our interventional business also delivered a strong quarter. In our gantry business, we continue to benefit from a strong cadence of orders. And our elevated backlog continues to give us high confidence in the performance of this business going forward. Finally, as a reminder, Q1 \u201823 results were impacted by constrained supply. In interventional, we continue to see strong performance from our Brevera needles, as well as from our 2-Mark markers used for marking biopsy sites in suspicious lesions and pressed tissue. Leveraging strong performance in the quarter, we believe our Breast health franchise remains well positioned to deliver on its financial targets in fiscal \u201824. Continuing next to Surgical, our first quarter revenue of $162.2 million increased 4.6% or high single digits when adjusted for selling days. The divisions growth continues to be fueled by MyoSure and the Related fluid system, with an increasing contribution from our laparoscopic portfolio. As anticipated, NovaSure declined in Q1 as we lapped the selling price contribution from the products V5 extension introduced just before fiscal \u201823. And finally, in our Skeletal business, first quarter revenue of $25.4 million declined 5.6% from lower capital placement and upgrades. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the first quarter. Gross margin of 60.8% was driven primarily by strong performance in our base business and higher than expected COVID revenues, which carries a favorable impact to our margin. However, as anticipated, our gross margin result remains temporarily depressed due to the ongoing amortization of semiconductor chips purchased at higher costs during the chip supply headwind. As we continue to deploy gantries, we are moving farther away from this high priced inventory. And as a result, we expect margins to continue to benefit from this inventory cycling as we progress through the year. Shifting to operating expenses, total operating expenses of $327.3 million in the first quarter decreased by 3.6%. This decrease in the period was driven by lower marketing spend, lower cost from fewer days and less expense due to the recently divested SSI business. For Q1 \u201923, this translates to a 28.5% operating margin in line with our expectations. While we continue to deliver a peer group leading operating margins, we continue to exercise operational discipline and continuously seek to improve where it makes sense for our business. Below operating income, other income net represented a gain in our fiscal first quarter. As expected, we benefited from elevated cash balance and high interest rates, even though we deployed significant cash in the quarter. Finally, our tax rate in Q1 was 19.75% as expected. Moving on from the P&L, cash flow from operations was $220 million in the first quarter. In addition, as previously mentioned, during Q1 we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $150 million. This activity was above and beyond initiating a $500 million ASR showcasing our high confidence in our business and willingness to bet on ourselves, as well as our ongoing strategy to deploy capital. Now let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal \u201824. For our fiscal Q2 \u201824, we are expecting total revenue in the range of %990 million to $1.01 billion and EPS of $0.95 to $1. For the full year \u201924, our guidance assumes revenue of $3.99 billion to $4.065 billion and EPS of $3.97 to $4.12. With respect to foreign exchange, we are assuming an FX tailwind of $2 million for Q2 and $12 million for fiscal \u201824. Much of this tailwind was realized in Q1 and therefore we estimate that foreign exchange will remain neutral to marginally favorable throughout the remainder of the year. Turning to our divisions, we want to reiterate that we expect each business to grow at least 5% to 7% for the full fiscal \u201824, excluding the impact of COVID. Starting with Diagnostics, we expect the business to grow within our 5% to 7% long term framework for the remainder of fiscal \u201824. While performance was below this level on Q1, primarily due to the impact of fewer selling days compared to the prior year period, we expect the division to return to more normal growth in Q2, and for the remainder of our fiscal year. We expect improving utilization and menu expansion on the Panther coupled with ongoing contributions from Biotheranostics to continue to drive molecular growth, losing out on non-COVID Diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of approximately $7 million in Q2, and $30 million for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $20 million in the second quarter of \u201824 and $60 million for the full year. COVID related items are expected to be slightly less than $30 million in the second quarter, and approximately $105 million for the full year fiscal \u201824. Moving to Breast health, we continue to expect fiscal \u201824 to showcase strong demand for our portfolio products and services. While moving on it's important to understand the top dynamics that will impact the Breast business through fiscal \u201824. As previously noted, Q1 \u201823 with a softer comp due to shift supply constraints. As a reminder in Q2 \u201823, we delivered a strong quarter gantry placement to meet pent-up customer demand during these earlier days of chip supply recovery. And deliveries in Q3 and Q4 of \u201923 were both lower than Q2. We expect this dynamic to result in a lower Breast health year-over-year growth rate in Q2 that will improve in the back half of fiscal \u201924. For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver more gantries in fiscal \u201824 than in \u201923 as we move further from the chip supply headwinds, while maintaining excellent demand visibility. Finally, in Surgical, we anticipate our full year fiscal \u201824 revenue growth to be at the high end of our 5% to 7% long term target. Although impacted by fewer selling days, Q1 started the year strong and we expect the business to perform well in Q2 in the remainder of the fiscal year. Moving next to margins, our guidance assumes a cadence of improvement throughout fiscal \u201924 for both gross margin and operating margin. For gross margin, we anticipate Q2 levels similar to Q1 exiting the fiscal year in the low 60s. As well, our guidance assumes Q2 operating margins approaching 30% with the Q4 \u201824 exit rate around 31%. Continuing down the P&L, we expect Q2 operating expenses to step down from Q1. As a reminder, Q1 is typically our highest spend quarter seasonally. As we kickoff the fiscal year with our internal global sales meetings, and major trade show events such as RSNA. For the balance of the year, we anticipate quarterly operating expenses to be about $300 million to $310 million. Although operating income, we estimate fiscal \u201824 other income net to be an expense of approximately $10 million in Q2 and an expense between $30 million to $50 million for the full year. Our current guidance assumes an increase in interest income relative to our previous guide, as we expect to have a higher cash balance throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75%. And diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 239 million for the full year. To conclude Q1 was a strong quarter across each of our businesses and sets us up nicely for the rest of the year. As we close Q1, we move forward to Q2 in fiscal \u201824 with good momentum and as always remain focused on advancing women's health around the world while delivering on our promises and commitments to our shareholders, employees, customers and patients around the world. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Tejas Savant : Hey, guys, good morning. Sorry. Good evening, and congrats on the solid performance here. Steve, I want to start with the Molecular Diagnostics franchise. I want to ask you a little bit about Aptima there. You've talked in the past about the benefits of co-testing the time it will take for physicians to embrace any change. That said, if guidelines move to HPV testing alone, how do you think about the upside on Aptima? And what if any, should be the gating factors to transitioning those volumes? Is there any sort of differences in competitive dynamics for ThinPrep versus the HPV franchise? Steve MacMillan : I think regardless of what happens with the guidelines, we see co-testing is being well entrenched. And if anything, it's going to probably get stronger with the approval we just got last night of our digital cytology business, which I think is probably not as fully appreciated. But as we bring that to market, it's going to dramatically improve the workflow for our customers. It's going to improve the efficacy it just -- it's probably the biggest improvement step forward in cytology in 40 years. So, we remain very committed and believing incredibly strongly, by the way as a reminder to single collection device that is used both for our Aptima HPV, as well as cytology. So it's no additional work for the doctor or the patient, and you get the results. So we continue to be very excited. And if anything, probably more excited about our cytology business combined with our HPV business going forward. Tejas Savant : Got it. That's helpful. And then Karleen, one for you on margin. So you talked about sort of exiting the [inaudible] at about 31%. Can you just help us parse out the dynamics from the gantry chips for the higher cost coming through the backlog here versus your network optimization plans? What are the relative impacts of those two drivers? And as we look to fiscal \u201825, should we be thinking of that 31% as a good jumping off point off of which you expect to see quarter-over- quarter expansion? Karleen Oberton : Yes, so let me take it into part two on the gross margin line. The chips in the network optimization efforts are probably about a 50 to 75 point basis headwinds to gross margins. And again, we see have line of sight to that improving over the course of the year, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks on operating expenses. If you looked at just Q1, if you took out the impact of kind of the seasonally high Q1, operating expenses, operating margins would been close to that 30%. So just moving through the year as we see those dynamics of the gross margin. In the normal step down and operating expenses, we see line of sight to extend year 31%. I do think that is a good jumping off point, I think I would caution from significant improvement over the course of \u201925 from there, given those are really, as we said, peer leading operating expenses. And we always want to continue to make sure that we are investing the right amount back into R&D and innovation and see the benefits like we saw last night with the approval of digital cytology. Operator : We will take our next question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys, how are you? Thanks for taking the question. Steve, maybe one for you on the Diagnostics business. It sounds like the rest of the year going to kind of hang around that 5% to 7% framework inside there. I think one of the reasons for the uptick was improve utilization. Obviously, that utilization piece has been a big focus as we come out of COVID. Now that we're in a relatively, hopefully relatively stable environment on the testing side without COVID. Can you just talk about utilization metrics that you're seeing? What gives you guys the confidence on that trajectory? Any metrics will be helpful there. Steve MacMillan : Yes, sure. Patrick, I think the biggest metric obviously we track over time is just purely revenue. And I think we continue to feel good but the internals on that are, if you go customer by customer, we continue to grow our portfolio with a lot of our customers and not to be overlooked are our largest customers in the US, as they shift from Tigris to Panther, it is opening up additional menu opportunities for them to be adopting things like BV, CV and some of our other products. So we see really good growth with our largest customers in the US, we're also continuing to see, and what we're still in the early-ish innings is the international expansion and all those Panthers we placed internationally during COVID, as those are coming online. And I think what I love about these businesses, frankly, is they bring on one or two assays at a time, they get more experience, and then they bring more. And so it's not like a one off pop. That frankly might be better in the short term, but the harder to laugh. And so what we really have going on around the world, our customers all over the place, just gradually bringing on either additional assays or as we come out with new menu, being able to build that and that installed base of Panthers that we're able to just drive more throughput through is what really makes us feel very good about the future. Karleen Oberton : I'll just add two points to that, Patrick, while we haven't given up our Panther utilization, I would say that we are seeing that our Panther utilization grow year-over-year. And the other metric I would give you that we went back to 2019, around 20% of our customers were running four more assays, that's probably close to doubled here at the end of \u201823. So those are things that should give us confidence of the stickiness of the Panther and the customers are adding menu. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Thanks. Good afternoon, Steve. There's always next season, soon enough. Steve MacMillan : That\u2019s right. Asterix is also a big Eagles fan. So we got covered. Jack Meehan : Oh, man. Yes, the payment frame. Well, wanted to get your thoughts on the Diagnostics business at Biotheranostics. Could you just give us an update? Talk about the growth runway for the breast cancer index test? And I think Karleen, you mentioned growth was accretive, but did it slow a little bit? Was that related to selling days or just any color would be great? Steve MacMillan : Yes, I think Jack, the more we look at the BCI test and the opportunities ahead of us, I think we're still in the earlier innings on what that business can become. And there's, since we've owned it, and watching the team operate, I think we just feel incredibly good about the long term potential. So it was still well accretive and still growing nicely here. We just don't want to be breaking it out down to the level given the size of it, but feel really, really good about the opportunity. Jack Meehan : All right, and then, the cash on the balance sheet, continue to get a lot of questions around M&A priorities for Hologic. The recent questions we've gotten had been around, interest in doing things in the med tech world, was wondering if you could just comment on that. And then, kind of on the Biotheranostics team, just like the world of specialty labs, kind of using that as a foray into that world. Just any color on M&A strategy would be great. Steve MacMillan : Yes, I think Jack, I think that the magic that because we are both Diagnostics and med tech, to your first part of that question. It does open up the opportunity for additional things, and we're seeing some interesting things that would allow us to build on our Surgical platform or our breast cancer, the breast surgery business areas. So we continue to look in those areas. And frankly, I think some of the valuations in those areas might be a little bit better than say, for example, some of the Diagnostics one. So I think we certainly can shop in that aisle. And coming back to the second part of your question and the other aisle, we can shop in the specialty labs. I think one of the things we're really proud of with Biotheranostics is it actually makes money which you very well know that a lot of the specialty labs there's a lot of great top line revenue, but a lot of expense and not much profit. And so I think we continue to want to be thinking about things that can be generating bottom line. As Karleen is staring at me hard right now. I'm making part of that up, but I've worked with her long enough to know her discipline so we're being very mindful and careful in that space and continuing to feel like, what we know we're good at is taking existing assets that are on the market and operating them pretty well. We don't want to take on, wildly diluted things, just because we have the cash. And we've continued to, I think, be patient and the underlying performance of our businesses continues to give us that ability to be patient. So hopefully, that gave you the landscape here, Jack. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Sourbeer with UBS, John Sourbeer : Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. Just a question on the start off on the Breast health business, any updates on what the backlog looks like there? And how many quarters of backlog that you have? And just how would that compare to a normal backlog in that business? Karleen Oberton : Yes, I think we certainly have several quarters of backlog probably going into early \u201925 at what I'll call elevated levels. We traditionally have but backlog for this business, given the capital nature of it, but we see it being elevated for probably the next three to five quarters, as we work through that backlog and supply, the gantries to our customers. John Sourbeer : Got it. And then, as a follow up on the Diagnostics business and in the Panther, I appreciate that you're not providing a full through there and I mean just but just anyway like quantitative or qualitative lead to provide on just what type of improvement on customer spending you're seeing with the addition of the Fusion sidecar. Karleen Oberton : So what I would say is that the respiratory menu is on the Fusion sidecar. So that's where we see the most upside coming through in that respiratory menu. But certainly, as we've talked about BV, CVs is really leading the growth in the Molecular Diagnostics business at this point primarily in the US longer term. That's a great opportunity internationally. But also seeing customers take on some of our legacy women's health assays as well. So feel good about that the whole menu is driving the growth but led by BV, CV at this point. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys, congrats on the [inaudible]. Thanks for taking my question. Hi, Steve. And maybe my first one for you here on, it was helpful for you to talk about those growth drivers. I'm curious what percentage of revenues do you think are growing high single sustainably? What percentage should be growing mid-single-ish? And what percentage of revenues are low singles? Have you looked at that analysis? I'm just curious on when you say 5% or 7%. How investors could get comfortable when they do the sum of the cost between with -- on the business segments? Steve MacMillan : Yes, I think we think about it by business segment. And I think what we've really said, Vijay is that each of our businesses this year should be within that 5% to 7%. So I think that has us feel really good. Obviously, within each of the businesses, we're not going to go down that product line by product line, right. But if you played it out, right, Surgical, you got MyoSure and Fluent growing faster than that you have NovaSure lower than that, right. We've got that always across the businesses. But I think the way to think about it is we feel really good about each of our businesses growing in that range. And I will tell you that internationally, each of those businesses is certainly at the higher end of that range, if not slightly beyond. So we've got it across, every business has growth drivers. And like any business, there's always a few that aren't growing as fast. And, that's just the nature of the beast. But overall, I think what we're, again, magically, every one of our businesses is in that frame. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And Karleen, maybe one view on the guidance like Q1 came in mid singles, despite the day's headwinds 2Q guidance is for about 3.5. Why, when I just think about the 3.5 five versus the five you did in Q1, is it just the comps, what\u2019s driving 2Q and when you think about the back half step up from first half to hit the annual guide, is that just the days normalization and back half or any other drivers we should be looking at the back half? Karleen Oberton : Yes, the biggest issue here in Q2 is the comps that is driving. So if you looked at Q2 of \u201823 DX ex- COVID grown 15%, molecular within that grown 24%, breast over 25% and surgical over 25%. So I think what we've been saying all along is that Q2 was just a standing quarter. Proud of that quarter. As we went into Q3 and Q4, we have more normalized comps that were going against that drive that improved growth rate in the back half. Operator : We will take our next question from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys, this is Dimitri speaking for Anthony. Congratulations on great quarter. I just saw I wanted to ask about like the Molecular Diagnostics, ex-COVID. Seems like might have slowed down this quarter versus like year-over-year, and just a little bit more color on that this quarter. And kind of like your expectations for Q2, do you see like a stronger respiratory virus season. How should we think about that? Steve MacMillan : Yes, I think the big piece that affected molecular in the quarter, the single biggest was the four fewer selling days. It's a disposable run rate business. And if you think about that, that knocked, between 400 and 600 basis points off the quarterly growth rate, frankly, depending on exactly how the days fall. And both that quarter and this quarter that we're in now, the second quarter are going against these ridiculously strong comps of over 20-ish percent molecular growth from a year ago. But I think the overall run rate, and the sheer size of the businesses now we feel very good about. Unidentified Analyst : Sounds great. And you guys gave full year guidance for COVID. Should we be thinking about that kind of the new baseline now going forward? Karleen Oberton : I think, as we've talked about, we think of COVID as upside. So as the guide would indicate as a continued step down each quarter. I mean, it's hard to really tell if there's another flu season next year that drives a little elevated COVID. But, again, we were looking at his upside. And so, maybe even think about something less than what we're anticipating for \u201824 and \u201825. Operator : We'll take our next question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Puneet Souda : Yes, hi, Steve, Karleen, thanks for taking the questions. Yes, hey, Steve. So first one on Genius Digital DX system, can you just remind me in a positive if I miss this, any changes to pricing or margins as a result? And maybe just I know, ThinPrep remains the same. But, can you just talk a little bit about, how do you see the adoption of this in a market that's fairly established already? And then I have a follow up for Karleen. Steve MacMillan : Sure. Thanks, Puneet. Yes, don't assume a real change in the margin structure. I think the real win here is for is the workflow, I will tell you, our key customers are incredibly excited, as you will know, right? One of the biggest issues right now, running labs, everything else is workers and cytologists especially trying to read these slides. It's been a very manual and labor intensive process. I can tell you going back to one of my first meetings with Quest, when I got in this role, almost 10 years ago, call that meeting with nine years ago, with discussions around, the workflow of cytology, and it was one of their biggest concerns. So our team has gone out and really addressing that, and I think the magic is going to be unleashing that as we are internationally as well. It's been part of what's starting to drive the growth in our European business has been having that approval already over there. So feeling really good, as well as, frankly, the reduction of the false negatives. So it's just that much more accurate. And going forward. So I think it's going to breed, we think it's going to breed some new life. Particularly, it's been the excitement from our customers that I think has been the galvanizing part for us. Puneet Souda : Got it. That's super helpful. And then the Karleen on, I wanted to ask about the tax rate. How are you thinking about the net result of the 15% global tax rate, if that was implemented, and then R&D tax credit that just sort of came through with the tax bill passing in the house, netting those effects, how should we think about the tax rate longer term for Hologic? Karleen Oberton : Yes, so let me first frame that to extent the global minimum tax rate is in fact good for us. It doesn't impact us till fiscal \u201826. So we've got some time before we have to deal with that I would say, given this lack of legislation here in the US, it's really hard to say what the impact is. But I would tend to think it'd be more on the middle side, given that our tax rate is already over the 15%. In regard to the change in the amortization for R&D expense, probably minimally favorable for us, but really minimal impact given us just a timing issue, really, in any event. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : Hey, thanks for taking the questions this evening. I want to start with Breast health, had an opportunity to spend some time with Eric and the team at RSNA. And I just curious because you mentioned the increase in gantries and just help us understand kind of where we're at, in the placement of gantries relative to sockets and just how much of the growth is coming from, new software like Genius AI detection, and things like that. And as we normalize for comps, what the right way to think about the growth of the Breast health businesses, given this mix now that's moving maybe away from equipment to more software. Steve MacMillan : You're right, I wouldn't underestimate that there's still going to be continued gantry placement. So a lot of the core is actually still the gantry placements. And then it's the service and the revenue and the additional AI and other things that we sell underneath it. But I think we continue to feel very good about the gantry placements, really from a couple of standpoints. First off, there's still kind of the tail end of going from 2D to 3D. But we're really into the mode now of also the early adopters of 3D. Their machines are now need to be upgraded. And with all the additional enhancements we've made to the system, we continue to place those gantries, so I think it's and we've turned it into certainly a much more diversified business. But at the core the gantries are still a very key foundational component of the strength of our business. Ryan Zimmerman : Okay, that's helpful, Steve, and then just piggybacking off that, I mean, I'd love to get your assessment on the CapEx environment we've heard from, some of your peers already, we have some 340B money that's kind of making its way back to hospitals, which may or may not be making its way in the capital equipment demand. But I'd love to get your view of kind of the year ahead on the CapEx demand from a logic perspective. Steve MacMillan : Yes, I think we continue to feel pretty good from, most of our customers around the CapEx side, I think when people were more fearful year, year and a half ago, we kind of felt like it was still okay, if there's little bits that dribble back in that's fine, too. But I think overall, we think we're in reasonable position and not seeing any dramatic changes one way or the other, least affecting our business. And again, we're not the biggest capital component for the hospitals, as are the ERP systems or the certainly the big iron pieces, we continue to feel like, regardless, we're in a good position. Operator : We'll take our next question from Casey Woodring with JPMorgan. Casey Woodring : Great, thank you for taking my questions. Maybe one for Karleen on the other income line, can you please be specific on what you're assuming for non-GAAP interest income, interest expense and other income for 2Q and the full year, by my math, I'm getting the $6 million of net interest and other income for 1Q and you're getting to $30 million to $50 million of other expense for the year. So just trying to bridge 1Q through the rest of the year? Karleen Oberton : Yes, so 1Q was a little unique in that and two pieces, our interest income was actually higher than our interest expense. Given that we still had a favorable interest rate hedging place which actually expired at the end of December. So moving forward, our interest expense, our weighted average cost of debt will increase about 100 basis points through the balance of the year, which really drives that flip and that interest expense will be higher than interest income, to the tune of roughly that $30 million to $50 million. Also in Q1 is we had about $4 million to $5 million of benefit below the line from our mark-to-market investments which really our EPS mutual they offset mark-to-market liability on deferred compensation. So we really don't forecast any benefit or expense related to that because again, this offset and operating expenses so it's really maintaining a high cash balance and I'm assuming some deployment as we exit the year. But it's really that exploration of that interest rate hedge contract that drives higher interest expense. Casey Woodring : Got it, that's helpful. And then maybe just if I can sneak one more in on the international piece saw very strong growth there above the fleet average, I think 33%, constant currency in breast. I know, international revenues inherently lower margin. You've talked about that before. But curious if you're doing anything there to drive that contribution margin higher, and investments you're making outside the US and how should we think about international margin expansion versus the fleet average kind of moving forward? Thank you. Steve MacMillan : Yes, we're really proud of what the international team has been doing and looking at selective pricing opportunities. They've been very disciplined on the cost side, so that we're still dilutive. Our international growth is still diluted, certainly to the gross margin, and it touch on the operating margin. But our team's being very disciplined and try to help lessen that gap over time. Karleen Oberton : Yes, and I think there's opportunities as we go direct in key markets, not only do we see better revenue performance, but that is usually typically accretive to the margin line as well. Operator : We'll take our next question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik Bruin : Hi, good evening. Hey, sorry, I don't do -- I typically don't do sports references. So I'm, I won\u2019t make one. But just out of, so I know you say that the markets not trench warfare, but I mean, you do have, I mean, you do have really strong competitors in viral load testing and STI testing. How should we sort of think about what your market shares are? And what's around? Because I mean, clear, I mean, there's, is it the market? Is the market to the testing or expanding for these? Or are they stagnating? I'm just curious about sort of like market growth? And then can you talk a little bit about what's your pipeline beyond BV, CV/TV and just, what other sort of like diet, what other sort of like molecular assays can be sort of be added? So it's question on like, what's the market expansion opportunities in some of these markets that are more, I would say competitive and hadn't historically grown a lot? And versus what's the new pipeline? Thanks. Steve MacMillan : Hey, Derik, starting on, there certainly as we face very formidable competitors. And there's a lot of hand to hand combat. The flip side is, and I think it is the piece that people consistently miss, is how much opportunity there is to expand our markets, right? Let's go to surgical for a moment. Nobody ever would have imagined that MyoSure would have someday gotten to be as big as NovaSure, when we first launched it. And now it dwarfs NovaSure, and is still growing strongly as we've come out with BV, CV, BV, CV may become our largest assay, it's sometimes it's hard to fully understand the impact in the end size of the market creation that we're doing. So we just want people to understand it's hard to fully identify because we're growing and building these markets. And when you look at even some of the data that we got from the Global Women's Health Index, where women's health sits, and testing sits globally, is still a fraction of what it should be, right? If you consider that only 10% of all women in the world got tested that should for STIs, that alone would say the market is probably 10x. Now, we're not going to realize that in the next five years either. So to call the total available market, truly 10x because it's not quite accessible at that level. It's we're in between. So, I think the gist is we continue to pioneer new products, new assays, and grow and create these markets over time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham and Company. Mike Matson : Yes, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to follow up on the earlier question just on the gantries in the mammography business side. I understand that you've made a number of enhancements and so forth, but I believe the platform's fairly been around for a while now. So, I mean, is there any, and I know you're not trying to be a capital focus, boom bust and all that stuff, but it seems like every company's got a kind of launching new platform every once in a while. So I mean, is that something we could see in the near term maybe? Steve MacMillan : Yes, completely. So first as a reminder, recall that we did launch our 3D performance and then our 3D. And what we've been doing is gradually improving, and working in better imaging, better detection all through. So it's not like we're selling a 10 year old product, even though we'd be up at it's now 10 years, a little 11 years since we got the 3D approved, but we've been selling newer products along the way. And having said that, we are working on additional hardware and gantry changes as well, that will evolve here, over the next few years. Mike Matson : Okay, thanks. So just in and then just on M&A, I think there was another question kind of about, the areas that you're looking at. But I guess I wanted to ask about just potential size of the deals, because I feel like you've kind of hinted or maybe directly commented in the past that you are potentially open to larger deals if you found the right thing. And by larger, I mean kind billion plus. Steve MacMillan : Yes, I think, we would consider something in that range. If it brings significant revenue, and frankly, EBITDA. So, we're not going to embark on something of that size for a science project or something early stage or something that's losing money, I would say, you would only expect us to do something like that we have the capacity. But it would have to be a pretty special asset. There's not a lot of things, but there are a few things we're looking at in that range. And we continue to be incredibly disciplined, but it will be established businesses that we think, we can improve upon in terms of their ability to contribute to us. So thank you. Ryan Simon : Hey, Cynthia, this is Ryan, in consideration of time, we'll take one final question. Operator : And we'll go next to Navann Ty with BNP. Navann Ty : Hi, thank you for taking my question, good evening. Maybe my first question if you can discuss your AI capabilities versus competition, including with breast health versus recent innovation like competitors. And a second question, following up on your comments regarding the [inaudible] international that you're meeting. Can you discuss the size of the long term opportunity outside of the US and any potential structural differences? Steve MacMillan : Yes, I think, relative to the AI front, as it relates to Breast health, we've been, on the leading edge for quite some time between our CAD programs and A, the Genius AI Detection program. So we continue to feel very good, particularly as it relates to the workflow advantages, and the linkage to our workstations and our products. And on the second question of international, I think, again, we've been generating, frankly, double digit growth for our international business for the better part, yes, excluding COVID-ish for last five or six years, and continue to see international being accretive to our overall growth rate here for years to come. So thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today's question and answer session. And this now concludes Hologic\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you and have a good evening.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Justin, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call. Ryan Simon : Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer; and Essex Mitchell, our Chief Operating Officer. Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation and a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are : one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding divested businesses and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which further excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.02 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.03. Both revenue and EPS came in above the high end of our guidance, reflecting another strong quarter. Similar to Q1, it is again important to view our Q2 performance in proper perspective. As we shared on our Q1 earnings call in February, throughout 2024, we faced double-digit comps, massive comps in the first half and still very strong comps in the second. As a reminder, in Q2 of last year, organic Molecular Diagnostics ex COVID posted growth of nearly 25%. And both Surgical and Breast Health posted phenomenal growth of over 25%. This year, in Q2, on top of the high growth rates from a year ago, we grew our Molecular Diagnostics business, ex COVID at 10.7%. Our surgical business, 7.4%; and our Breast Health business 1%, excluding the divested SSI business, a solid result given the elevated gantry placements in Q2 a year ago. We also delivered operating margins of 30.4% in Q2, improving 190 basis points sequentially from Q1 and setting us up nicely to approach 31% for the full fiscal year. Now past the halfway point of fiscal '24, we believe we are in an excellent position to achieve our full year goals. Before moving on to our themes for today, our fiscal second quarter marks the fourth anniversary of when the COVID virus changed the world. When COVID initially surged, we had 3 goals : one, ensure that we take care of our employees; two, make a huge difference in the world with our Panther system and COVID testing. And three, emerge as a bigger, stronger, faster growing company in a post-pandemic world. Fast forward to today, as you can see from our results, we have delivered against these 3 goals, and we're aiming for more. Not only did we achieve our primary objectives, we also successfully managed to strengthen all of our franchises, both in the U.S. and internationally, remain innovative and disciplined in executing our growth strategies and build a fortress balance sheet to facilitate future growth. On top of these achievements, we continue to elevate our already high employee engagement scores and all through complicated macro challenges. That said, we are never satisfied and firmly believe the best is still ahead. As we look further out beyond the horizon, we see significant potential to continue to innovate and unlock growth opportunities for years to come. Now on to our 3 themes for today. First, our core franchises Diagnostics, Breast Health and Surgical continued to showcase the benefits of our diverse portfolio. As planned, we continue to yield robust growth and durability because we benefit from being both Diagnostics and Medtech. Second, our international business quietly continues to drive strong top line growth. demonstrating our ability to capture potential growth opportunities and turn them into reality. And third, our strong balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital allocation, empower us to fortify our foundation as we've done this week with the announcement of the Endomagnetics acquisition. We have the ability to build on our strength with significant operational flexibility, which allows us multiple levers to deliver top and bottom line performance. Turning to our first theme. Sometimes overlooked and misunderstood -- the strength of our business comes from the sum of our parts. We are a unique collection of Diagnostics and Medtech businesses with many more growth drivers than meets the eye. Each business has multiple growth drivers with tremendous runway ahead. To the outside, it may be unclear how we can keep driving growth with the strong market shares we have. In reality, our product and service diversity creates enduring strength as we advance forward and notch incremental wins. Over time, these wins collectively deliver meaningful and durable growth across multiple franchises and multiple geographies. While we know we don't fit neatly into either diagnostics or medical device, we do fit neatly into the world of improving women's health. Our unique set of businesses equips us to deliver results and positively impact more and more women regardless of external macro challenges. Our strong growth over the past 4 years reflects a combination of multiple durable growth drivers intentionally built into each of our businesses. The beauty here is that over time and in any given quarter, our growth drivers can change and morph. What we've done is create multiphase extended and stacked growth cycles. The net result is our ability to consistently deliver on a consolidated basis over time. A few examples to highlight from across our business. In our second quarter, worldwide diagnostics growth ex COVID of 9.8% was again primarily driven by our Molecular Diagnostics business. In Molecular Diagnostics, over the last few years, we've dramatically expanded both our installed base and menu, nearly doubling our installed base from 1,700 Panthers to over 3,200 during the pandemic and going from 4 FDA-approved assays to over 20. Our next phase of growth is about menu adoption and driving more volume by focusing largely on existing customers while adding more geographies. At the same time, we continue to broaden our menu. As a result, we create years of growth ahead as we extend our commercial reach and continue to add products to our portfolio. In the second quarter, U.S. Molecular Diagnostics delivered double-digit growth, led by ongoing adoption of BV/CV/TV on the Panther, strong contributions from our respiratory suite of assays on the fusion as well as continued growth from Biotheranostics. Each of these are newer products to our portfolio, underscoring the power of our extended reach, layering on top of the strong U.S. molecular performance, international cytology was also accretive to worldwide diagnostics growth. Outside the U.S., diagnostics growth was driven primarily by multi-country adoption of our innovative Genius AI digital psychology in the quarter. As a reminder, digital cytology was only recently approved in the U.S. earlier this year. meaning the U.S. opportunity is still ahead. In Breast Health, we've expanded our product offering from imaging to cover the continuum of breast cancer care, including biopsy and surgery. In the second quarter, on a worldwide basis, the gantry and service businesses performed well against very strong comps from the prior year period. Meanwhile, outside the U.S, our emerging interventional breast business grew double digits in Q2, accretive to the worldwide growth rate. And finally, in Surgical. Once essentially only a U.S. 2 product business with NovaSure and MyoSure, we now have Fluent, Accesa and Bolder. And internationally, we are just getting started with both the core business and new product lines. In Q2, worldwide growth of 7.4% was very strong against the high prior year comp. Our performance was driven in large part by very strong double-digit growth in our International Surgical business, which in Q2 is a reflection of continued market penetration as well as our go-direct strategy in the Nordics. All in, we are a powerful women's health composite. As we extend our reach globally, we expect to grow even in product categories and territories that may on their surface appear to be mature and well penetrated. With that, I'll turn the call over to Essex to discuss our final 2 themes for today. Essex Mitchell : Thank you, Steve. As previewed by Steve's discussion of our diverse and durable growth drivers, our strong international growth is a direct result of identifying and capturing underpenetrated market opportunities with steady execution. As a reminder, our international business is over 40% larger than it was in 2019. We are in more territory and more direct than ever before. That said, big picture, we are still in the early days of our international opportunities. Our early success is driven largely by 2 approaches : One, going direct; and two, entering markets where we elevate the standard of care. For example, on the latter, while the ThinPrep Pap test, 2D and even 3D mammo and procedures like NovaSure and MyoSure are widely accepted as standard of care in the U.S., internationally, this is unfortunately not yet the case. Many parts of the world even those considered developed and industrialized, still have the opportunity to elevate their screening, diagnosis and treatment of women to gold standards. These women deserve it, and Hologic is poised to realize this potential. Acceptability to women's health options around the world remains a priority and a great opportunity for Hologic. This is why our work with the Hologic Global Women's Health Index and our worldwide partnership with the Women's Tennis Association to elevate women's health, education and access are critically important. Reinforcing our position, the index clearly shows that we are only scratching the surface of the global opportunity, and this holds true even in Europe, with other large market geographies like Asia Pacific being further out on the time horizon. From our perspective, as leading champions for women's health, we believe there is still significant market adoption opportunity ahead of us. And this adoption will not happen overnight, we expect adoption to grow over time, at different paces around the world as more and more governments prioritize women's health. And for our final theme today, we'd like to underscore the importance of our strong balance sheet and recap our capital allocation priorities. With over $2 billion in cash and strong cash flow we have the capacity to fund key in-house initiatives and also deploy cash towards both M&A and share repurchases. Regarding capital allocation, our strategy remains the same. We are focused on tuck-in opportunities for our 3 core franchises. And as we have stated in the past, we have a strong preference for any potential deal to have a clear line of sight to accretion on both top and bottom line, if not immediately, the sooner, the better. Our business development teams across each of our franchises are consistently building and reviewing opportunities in their respective pipeline. We view our ability to shop across multiple aisles as a strength as we continue to grow into an even greater performing composite than we are today. The ability to shop in multiple aisles also creates the flexibility to maneuver potentially unfavorable valuations in one aisle versus another. Overall, a blend of adding in-house developed and external innovation across our strong fan franchises is an important part of our growth strategy. Leading into our strategy, on Monday, we announced our agreement to acquire Endo-Magnetics LTD -- a provider of breast cancer surgery technologies for approximately $310 million. Endo-Mag's portfolio of innovative breast surgery localization and lymphatic tracing products complements and diversifies our expanding interventional breast business. We are excited for the potential to join forces, amplify growth and better serve patients around the world. In calendar 2023, Endomag generated approximately $35 million of revenue, and we believe our combined global reach and breadth of interventional options will accelerate growth in this exciting space. At this point, we are still early and do not have a definitive time line on closing the transaction, though we estimate to close in the second half of calendar year. Before I turn the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying we are proud of our strong Q2 results that build on our Q1 performance. All said, we are in a solid position to carry our success into Q3 and Q4. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Essex, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, I will provide an overview of our revenue results, walk down our income statement showcasing strong performance, touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal 2024. As highlighted, our second quarter financial results were very strong. exceeding our expectations on revenue and profitability. Q2 was a continuation of our momentum from Q1. Total revenue came in at $1.018 billion, beating the midpoint of our guidance by $18 million. We delivered organic growth of 4.9%, excluding COVID, on top of a challenging double-digit comp from the prior year. In addition, non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.03, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by $0.03. Before moving on to our franchise results,  we want to highlight the continued strength of our balance sheet. In Q2, we generated over $290 million in cash from operating activities and ended the quarter with nearly $2.2 billion on the balance sheet. Our strong cash balance leverage ratio well below our target range and ability to consistently generate strong cash flow provide us the flexibility to fund innovation and execute our capital allocation strategy. We have significant firepower to continue to deploy capital as opportunities arise. Turning to our franchise results. In Diagnostics, second quarter revenue of $450.1 million declined 3.2%. Excluding COVID assay and related revenue, worldwide Diagnostics grew by 9.8%. Within Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continues to contribute significantly, growing 10.7% excluding COVID. We continue to see underlying strength in BV/CV/TV, which continues its outstanding growth trajectory. BV/CV/TV is tracking to become our second largest assay globally. With very little international revenue as we have focused primarily on the U.S. market. Additionally, as expected, non-COVID respiratory assay sales remained solid as the flu season continued into our second quarter. Growth was a combination of more volume year-over-year across our respiratory menu plus ASP lift from elevated contribution from our COVID, Flu A, Flu B and RSV 4-Plex assay. Finally, Biotheranostics remains a strong pillar of growth for our base molecular business. Rounding out Diagnostics, Psychology and perinatal grew 7.9% globally, primarily fueled by double-digit growth internationally as well as impact from the prior year comp. As a reminder, Q2 last year was adversely impacted by supply constraint issues related to a third-party logistics partner. Level set growth in the second quarter is above our long-term expectations for this business. Moving on to Breast Health. Total second quarter revenue of $384.6 million decreased 0.3%, but grew 1% when excluding SSI. As a reminder, Q1 '24 resulted in an elevated growth rate assisted by lapping soft prior year performance due to supply constraints in Q1 '23. The opposite is true for Q2 '24, where we faced significant prior year comps. In Q2 of last year, we placed an elevated number of gantries as semiconductor chip supply and visibility improved. For the remainder of the year, we expect growth rates in the gantry business to normalize. Within Breast Health, growth was driven primarily by our international interventional mix. This highlights the diversity of growth drivers Steve and Essex commented on. And the fact that growth drivers across our business and within our divisions can change and morph over time. Continuing next to Surgical. Second quarter revenue of $156 million increased 7.4%. Surgical growth continues to be fueled by MyoSure in the related Fluent fluid management system. As anticipated, NovaSure continues to be a headwind to growth as we lapped the prior year NovaSure V5 ASP lift. And finally, in our Skeletal business, Second quarter revenue of $27.1 million declined 14.3% from lower capital placements and upgrades. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin was 60.7% for the quarter and in line with expectations. The decline of 160 basis points from the prior year was anticipated and primarily driven by lower COVID sales compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, we expect gross margin to improve as we work past the amortization of previously procured higher-priced semiconductor chips. Total operating expense of $307.6 million in the second quarter decreased by 3%. This decrease was primarily driven by elimination of expenses related to the divested SSI business. As Steve mentioned, the operating margin was 30.4% for the second quarter. The year-over-year decline of 90 basis points was driven primarily from lower COVID sales. Sequentially, as expected, operating margins expanded 190 basis points from Q1 largely from lower operating expenses in Q2, a strong result for the quarter. Below operating income, other income net represented a loss of nearly $6 million in our first -- in our fiscal second quarter. As expected, interest income is lower due to lower cash balances from the significant share repurchases completed earlier in the fiscal year.  Additionally, interest expense is up due to lower proceeds from our interest rate swaps. Finally, our tax rate in Q2 was 19.75% as expected. Now let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2024. For Q3 2024, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $992.5 million to $1007.5 million. and EPS of $0.98 to $1.05. For the full year 2024, our guidance assumes revenue of $4 billion to $4.05 billion. and EPS of $4.02 to $4.12. With respect to foreign exchange, we expect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar to create a significant headwind in the second half of the year. For Q3, we are assuming FX headwind of about $3 million. For the full year, we now expect a slight tailwind of about $2 million. All in, this represents about a $2 million -- a $10 million impact to our prior guidance. And as a reminder, prior guidance assumed a $12 million tailwind for the full year. Turning to our franchises. We want to reiterate that we expect each to grow at least 5% to 7% in our fiscal 2024, excluding the impact of COVID. While we have navigated the most challenging comps from fiscal '23, we still have strong double-digit comps across the board to close out fiscal '24. Starting with Diagnostics. We expect our Molecular Diagnostics business to drive high single-digit growth, excluding COVID as customers continue to adopt and drive utilization of our expanded menu. In cytology and perinatal, however, we expect minimal growth in Q3. In Q3 of last year, customers built inventory as a result of the third-party shipping constraints experienced in Q2 of '23, resulting in slightly elevated sales. We expect to see more normalized comps for our cytology and perinatal business in fiscal year '25. Closing out on non-COVID diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of approximately $7 million in Q3 and $28 million for the full year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be about $5 million to $10 million in Q3 '24 and about $60 million to $65 million for the full year. COVID-related items are expected to be about $25 million in the third quarter and approximately $105 million for the full year. Moving on to Breast Health. We remain on pace to grow the business within the 5% to 7% range for the year. As a reminder, we closed out fiscal '23 with 3 straight quarters of 25% plus growth rates. We expect steady performance in Breast Health in the back half of the year as the business continues to improve sequentially. The demand for our portfolio of products and service remains strong. and we continue to have excellent visibility into gantry orders. Further, our confidence in delivering more gantries than last year remains high. We continue to successfully manage resource availability among both our install teams and our customers, as customers balance the need to meet elevated demand for screening and staffing constraints. Finally, in Surgical, we anticipate our full year fiscal 2024 revenue growth to be at the high end of our 5% to 7% long-term target. The growth will continue to come from MyoSure Fluent as well as both Accessa and Bolder. Moving next to margins. We reiterate that our guidance assumes the cadence of improvement throughout fiscal '24 for both gross margin and operating margin. For gross margin, we anticipate Q3 will improve sequentially from Q2 as we continue to work through our higher cost chips in Breast Health. Remain on pace to exit the fiscal year in the low 60s. Our guidance also assumes Q3 operating margins in the low 30s, and we remain on pace to finish fiscal '24, approaching 31%. Below operating income, we estimate fiscal '24 other income net to be an expense of approximately $10 million in Q3 and an expense between $30 million and $40 million for the full year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $238 million for the full year. To conclude, Q2 was another strong quarter and sets us up nicely for the second half of the year. As always, we remain focused on advancing women's health around the world while delivering on our promises and commitments to our shareholders, employees, customers and patients. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Steve, maybe one on the Diagnostics, particularly the molecular DXP continues to put up pretty good numbers in spite of obviously some tough comps, pretty competitive environment, too. Can you just to back that a little bit and just talk about what you're seeing in the market? Again, you called out obviously a few assays that are doing well. But just curious the key drivers of the strength there and the durability as you look forward and how you think about that franchise over the next few quarters? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, Patrick, I really call it. It's the dividend and reward for coming to the country and the world's rescue when they needed a stern COVID. And as you well know, we placed a ton of Panthers, almost doubled our worldwide placements. And the big question all through that time and through those next few years was, yes, what's going to happen to those Panthers on the back end. And what we said is just keep watching, because I think what we feel great about is in a labor-constrained world, our Panther and the workflow automation, combined with the incredible menu that we have the tight footprint on Panther. And then we've added the Fusion sidecar that these things are just incredible workhorses that really are getting the adoption. And I think you start to -- when you put a double-digit number on top of a 25% number from last year, what we're really just seeing is more customers putting more menu on their Panthers. And I think it's -- the proof is what we've been saying for years and hopefully, it's starting to become evident in the results. Patrick Donnelly : That's helpful. I appreciate it. And then maybe just on the capital allocation side, that remains focus obviously you guys announced the recent deal. Can you just talk about the priority? You have the larger repo. I think that last quarter, a smaller deal, a little bit of dilution. How do you think about the priorities here in terms of the balance sheet? And how actively be on the M&A side post that deal? Just how large your thinking would be helpful. Stephen MacMillan : Yes, Pat, let's try to put this into context. We were talking as a team about this the other day and said, if we can line up the perfect world, we'd love to do like one Endomag every quarter. right? $300 million deal, bring in some additional revenue products that drop in that we know what to do and just kind of keep phasing those along and then maybe a little bit of a buyback here or there. The real world doesn't work nearly as linear. But that's what we would like to be doing is those size deals on a fairly regular basis. Because they don't always pop up from time to time, it is where we'll jump in and do some buybacks, and we're comfortable amassing the cash because there might be a year where we can do a number of these like we did at one point during COVID when we picked up Biotheranostics, Fluent, Accesa, Diagenode, these things that have all been very good for us. So no real change. We think the Endomagnetics deal is right down the fairway, hopefully, exactly what anybody would expect from us and what we've been signaling and if we can find more of those, that'd be great. With that, I'll kick it to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Yes. I would just emphasize, Patrick, that the strength of our balance sheet as well as our ongoing cash flow generation allows us significant flexibility to do things like Endomag and the share repurchase on an ongoing and regular basis. So for years to come as we look at our financial projections over the coming years, so we have a lot of flexibility and strength. Operator : And our next question will come from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : I wanted to -- can take the eagle's questions off-line. For now, I wanted to focus on the Breast Health business pick up where we just left off. I was wondering Essex talked a little bit about the time line to close Endomagnetics. Is there any commentary you can share just around the valuation for the deal in context of like what your expectations are in terms of the growth rate of this business maybe more broadly, just how it fits with the existing portfolio. Karleen Oberton : Yes. Well, I think we think it fits really nicely with our existing interventional portfolio. And I think that's 1 of the values that we'll bring is that currently Endomag uses a mix of direct and distributors, and we obviously have a significant direct sales force in the U.S. that I think will be a differentiator for us with that asset in our hands. Jack Meehan : And then any comments you can share around like the growth rate you're expecting for this business? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I would just say, Jack, we would expect it to be accretive certainly to the division's growth rate. Stephen MacMillan : Sorry. I'm sorry, go ahead, Justin. Operator : Oh, I'm sorry. I was just going to say our next question is from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Unknown Analyst : This is Yuko on the call for Tejas. I have one question on the recent breast cancer screening update. If USPSTF recommends annual mammal screening them, what does that do from a physician adoption standpoint, given ACS is already there? And then from a quantitative standpoint, how much of an uplift would annual testing represent to your Breast Health business? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. As you saw, they're really kind of still in the biannual world and we don't think the USPSTF guidelines changed much. Recall that our Breast Health is really a screening business where it's a capital sale and less volume dependent. But we really don't see much of an impact either way, just as when the guidelines shifted \"negatively\" a few years back, I didn't see a downturn there and don't see a big shift now. We do think the guidelines are a step forward for women. Unless you're a woman over 74 where they still haven't gone far enough. Unknown Analyst : Got it. That was helpful. And then another question on USPSTF. If they were to move to an HPV primary what would a potential trial design look like to establish primary HPV delay claim on your existing optima test? And what would the time line be to run such trial? Is there a possibility of using real-world data? Or would you need a prospective trial? Stephen MacMillan : We are very focused on maintaining co-testing as the gold standard. If anything, what we're seeing is a modest uptick in cervical cancer in women in the United States that really started when the intervals went from to 3 to 5 years back almost 10 years ago and believe absolutely the co-testing is the right way to go. That continues to be -- our base is based on the scientific facts. Operator : And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Unknown Analyst : This is Kevin on for Vijay. Congrats on the quarter, 5% on top of a tough comp last year is impressive. Just on your organic revenue guide range, it looks like it's tightening versus being raised, given performance in the quarter, why not raise guidance? and was this quarter performance above your internal expectations? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I would just say the impact on the full year guidance is primarily related to currency, if you actually look at the midpoint of this guide versus our prior guide on a constant currency basis, it's up slightly. So we really view the performance in this quarter a lot of to tighten the range as you indicated really hone in and delivering within that range. Stephen MacMillan : No need to get too far ahead of ourselves. Great. Operator : We'll take a question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Puneet Souda : Steve First one, if I could touch on the Genius digital cytology system. I mean you've had that in the U.S. market for -- correct me, for a quarter or so. Just, can you provide a feedback on sort of what are you hearing from the early folks in the field? And do you expect the international adoption of this sort of playing out similarly within the U.S.? And are you hearing anything in terms of the pushback in terms of the overall throughput of the system? Karleen Oberton : Yes. Let me kick off in that. Yes, it was just recently approved in the U.S., and I would say that we're really partnering with our lab customers on implementing and integrating into the workflow, so that's what we're focused on really more of a successful integration into the lab workflow at this point. So minimal contribution in '24 from the U.S. approval. But I think the feedback here, early days, there's a lot of excitement of what this can do in what we've talked about in a labor-constrained environment. And we think those will be really well received. Puneet Souda : Got it. And a broader question maybe for Steve. I mean when you look at the overall competitive landscape, Steve, there's another larger peer who's in the point-of-care testing side, but they pointed out 40% growth in [Strep A] and women's health -- and I know sort of their positioning is different in the market, but just wondering sort of how you're seeing the share shift. We're also seeing that one of the larger peers that's in the reference lab side, they still don't have RSV in the market for their product. So just trying to understand sort of where the opportunity set for Hologic continues to be the most strongest and where you think the share opportunities will be -- will continue to be the sort of the strongest going forward? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. It's funny in so many ways, we don't focus always as much probably on share as we do on just building our business for our customers and growing the categories. So I think what we continue to feel great about is we've got, as you know, more respiratory menu than we've ever had. We've got the Fusion sidecars, so we're building a respiratory business. We're not competing in the point of care business. We are very strong in our reference labs in the hospital systems, the public health labs and just really focused on delivering for those customers. And we believe we've got both an economic and workflow advantage as well as, frankly, the sensitivity specificity of a lot of our assays. So continue to feel very good about the growth rates there. And at the end of the day, these are big markets, and there will be, I think, several companies going up and others that will be shared donors in the equation. Operator : And moving on to Casey Woodring with JPMorgan. Casey Woodring : Great. So just now that we're halfway through the fiscal year, looking at the top line guidance above the LRP range on an ex COVID and ex selling day basis after the strong quarter, particularly in Diagnostics and Surgical. I'm curious on how you guys are thinking about your fiscal '25 and if growth could fall on potentially the higher end of the LRP range or even above the range? How should we think about the different moving parts there given the outperformance here so far? Stephen MacMillan : Yes, Casey, you'll love it. We're not going anywhere near '25 guidance at this point in time. So we've given the long range we're delivering for now, investing for the future. But stay tuned for the November call, and we'll get into that. But thank you. Casey Woodring : All right. And then maybe if I could just follow up here. How do you assess the international opportunity for BV/CV/TV, you mentioned in the prepared that the strong growth you've seen in that assay really hasn't included any international contribution. So maybe help us frame how much growth runway you have on that assay just based on phasing in the international piece. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. We're earlier stages of really looking at the opportunity there. There are some other things on the markets and frankly, the indication is not necessarily developed. So it's probably a little more of a market development longer-term opportunity for us internationally as frankly, many of our products have been. So very minimal expectations in the near term internationally. I would tell you though we love the momentum we have, certainly in the United States on it. Operator : And we have a question from Andrew Brackmann with William Blair. Andrew Brackmann : Maybe on the international business and margins, in particular, can you maybe just sort of talk to us about some of the levers which exist there to drive future margin expansion for that segment in general? And how much of that is in your control? And I guess as a related follow-up here, if we go back a handful of years, logic has been pretty successful in acquiring distributors, namely international distributors. So I guess, how does that sort of play into that margin expansion opportunity? Karleen Oberton : Yes. Certainly, that is one of the strategies to improve margins as we go direct and we find that as we go direct, we have better outcomes in those markets with our market development and market access capabilities, which -- that is something we have invested in over the last 5 years. So that strength that commercial investment at the point of leverage as we move forward as well as we continue to grow the portfolio, specifically surgical -- it's early days, but certainly, the surgical portfolio is an accretive product to the overall margin profile for that business. So I think there'll be multiple drivers as we move forward. Operator : And our next question will come from Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Andrew Cooper : Maybe just first sticking with international. One thing jumps out, just looking at the table at the bottom of the release. The region that seems to have the most outsized growth has really been kind of all other. I think part of that might just be COVID unwinding a little bit, but maybe any thoughts there? And then as you think about the international opportunity, can you highlight maybe if it's a particular product in a particular region or a particular region in general? What areas are you most excited about in terms of that geographic expansion opportunity as we sit here in the start of May '24. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think the magic of our international business is -- it's a lot of individual products in individual countries that we've been building kind of market access capabilities and everything over the years. And while there's no one that's driving it. We've just got a series of different products and different geographies that are really building momentum. And a lot of them in kind of the surgical and interventional space. Certainly, we're getting very excited about our Surgical business and its opportunity internationally, both what we've been doing with our own sales forces plus we did mention we acquired our distributor in the Nordics. So continuing to go -- feel very well there. And then it's just -- you get different times. The fact we got our digital cytology approved, internationally, that's been going very well in Western Europe. So it's just this collection of the different franchises, the different geographies building over time. And I think the magic is, Andrew, from the years in the past, we always said we're going to be building these businesses internationally, not by showing up 1 day and saying, hey, we're going to dramatically expand our sales forces and take a year off on profit growth. We've been making the investments all along. And then as certain products launch in certain countries, then we use that funding to fund the next year and keep building. So it's really just this inexorable building of success. Operator : Our next question come from Andrew Petrone with Mizuho Securities. Unknown Analyst : This is Brad Davis on for Anthony. -- not another Andrew, but -- talk on the Breast Health business. I figure -- whenever we see you guys make a move in Breast Health, obviously, core competency at which you're paying attention. The one to kind of hear your strategic rationale on the Endomag acquisition, why you see now as kind of a time to get bigger on the procedural side of the business and if we should expect kind of further moves to cover the swap and the continuum, if there's any other assets that you think that you'd like to have in that portfolio? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. I think the biggest piece is it's just a continuation of what we've been doing over the last 5, 6 years where we've tried to build, especially the gantry business and build out across the breast care continuum. So into biopsies and into interventional techniques. So as we've been building our own markers business, this has been an area we've been looking. We got into localizer a few years back. We've been doing both organic, inorganic. And the timing on this one really is driven by the opportunity to pick up Endomag. They've been a business we've been tracking for quite some time that we liked a lot, and the opportunity finally became available to grab them. Thank you. But yes, just continuing on what we've been doing. Unknown Analyst : Got it. That's helpful. And then just to stay on the breast business, you recently called out some of the life cycle in the boxes 2014 launch time frame. So maybe getting to the 9-, 10-year time frame. Can you just remind us, I guess, the life span on these devices and how Hologic plans to kind of best monetize the upgrade replacement opportunity and also if this is part of the rationale on timing of any new systems software and product enhancements. Karleen Oberton : Yes. I would say we've been very intentional into really smooth out that business and really move away from the boom bust of a life cycle replacement -- replacement cycle. And as we've talked about, we've had many software and other upgrades to the gantry system over the past several years, all of which have been backwards compatible to that installed base. The customers have been able to get improvements and upgrades along the way. They don't have to wait for that next gen gantry. But having said that, we certainly have something in development, but that's what we'll be talking about later, probably in '25. Operator : Absolutely. That question will come from [Michael Ryskin] with Bank of America. Unknown Analyst : This is John came on for Mike. I think we've talked about these numbers before, and I was wondering the improved utilization seems to be the main contributor. So I was wondering how the average number of assay used for Panther has been trending, like what percentage of the customers is using more than one assay versus more than 4 assays. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So I think if we go back to 2019, we would say that less than or about 20% of our customers were running about 4 more assays at the end of that into '22, that was probably approaching high 30%, maybe 40%. But I think that's the entire installed base. But I think the other metric I'd look to -- point to is the newer Panthers that were placed since April of 2020. So new customers acquired since the pandemic over 90% of those customers are running at least one other assay and over 55% of running at least 2 other assays. So I think that all points to the value, the workflow that our customers see with the Panther instrument in the menu and the long runway ahead to continue to drive utilization on the installed base.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cynthia, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations to begin the call. Please go ahead. Ryan Simon : Thank you, Cynthia. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer; and Essex Mitchell, our Chief Operating Officer. Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are : one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding divested businesses and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which further excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, other revenue related to COVID-19, and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue for Q3 was $1.01 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.06, both again above the high-end of our guidance. Importantly, we are excited that with COVID now mostly in the rear view mirror, our reported revenue has returned to growth. Our strong performance goes beyond the top line and shines throughout the P&L. For the quarter, we delivered a solid 31.2% operating margin and deployed $100 million during the quarter to repurchase 1.4 million shares. All-in, the $1.06 in EPS translates to 14% growth on the bottom-line, a very strong result and also very encouraging as we flip the script now to reported revenue and EPS growth again. Looking back to the start of our fiscal year, we knew there were still certain questions on some investors\u2019 minds about the true strength and durability of our underlying business. These were questions that surfaced as we exited a period of uncertainty created by the pandemic, followed by the global chip shortage. While we and many long-term investors understood the power and potential of our transformed, much stronger business, we acknowledged that these unanswered questions created barriers for some of those newer to Hologic. As usual, rather than rely on words, we knew it would be our performance that would emphatically answer these questions and clearly demonstrate that we are indeed a bigger, faster, stronger company than before the pandemic. Our third quarter performance should make this very clear. In Q3, we bent the top-line curve to green after eleven quarters of COVID driven declines. Our top line reported revenue returned to growth at 3.1% versus last year. Organic ex-COVID we delivered healthy 5.8% growth and we achieved these strong results on top of exceptionally strong 18.4% organic ex-COVID growth last year. Turning to our themes for today. First, we would like to recap our performance since the start of the fiscal year by answering five key questions which were on many investors\u2019 minds. Second, we\u2019ll pass the call over to Essex, who will highlight certain overlooked elements of our broad-based international growth, as well as provide an update on M&A activities. On to our first theme. The top five questions which have been out there : One, will Panther utilization continue to grow? Two, will Breast Health return to full strength and maintain market leadership? Three, will Hologic return to delivering industry-leading 30% plus operating margins? Four, with a $2.4 billion dollar cash position, will Hologic be successful in deploying capital? And finally five, can Hologic maintain its cervical cancer screening leadership if USPSTF issues an adverse cervical cancer screening guideline? The short answer to all five is, without a doubt, yes. We will continue to thrive. From here, we will take each question in order. First, our molecular diagnostics business continues to deliver and is so much bigger and stronger than it was prior to the pandemic. Our global installed base of Panthers now exceeds 3,300 and is rock solid. More importantly, our customers continue to praise and utilize our platform. Panther\u2019s superior workflow, automation, ease of use, and constantly expanding menu continues to drive demand and differentiate us in a competitive environment. In quite simple terms, revenue per Panther and number of assays run per Panther continue to grow, with the simple metric being our Molecular Diagnostics growth rate. In Q3, our molecular business excluding COVID grew 10.5%, on top of 12.9% growth in the prior year period. We\u2019ve now delivered high-single to double-digit performance in 13 of the last 15 quarters. Quarter-after-quarter, year-over-year, we continue to deliver by expanding utilization, and our outlook remains bright. Second, our breast health results continue to demonstrate a profound strength in breast cancer screening. Our gantry business is well on pace to fully recover from the chip shortage, and we continue to maintain our leadership position. Our supply chain is much improved and now fortified from successfully navigating the chip shortage experience. Over a decade from the initial launch of our breakthrough 3D mammography, customers still view Hologic as leaders in performance, including image quality and scan time, leaders in service, and leaders in customer satisfaction. Letting the numbers speak for themselves, in Q3, we delivered 7.1% growth in Breast Health, on top of 27.5% growth in the prior year period. The business is more diverse than ever, and continuing to add in even more recurring revenue with our Endomagnetics acquisition. Third, operating margins. As Karleen will share in more detail later, we delivered a 31.2% operating margin in our third quarter, a 230 basis point improvement from the prior year period, and an 80 basis point improvement sequentially. At the highest level, we are now back to delivering pre-COVID margins, even with our International business being over 40% larger than it was in 2019. Consistent with our expectations, we recaptured our strong sector margin profile by maintaining focus on operational efficiency and moving past the amortization of higher priced chips purchased during the chip shortage. Fourth, on capital deployment, our balance sheet and cash flow remain incredibly robust. As announced last week, we recently closed the Endomagnetics acquisition, a transaction that we view as straight down the fairway in terms of execution within our broader M&A strategy. Overall, the deal is a prudent investment of capital that we expect to add revenue, margin and EPS accretion over time. Together, we have an incredible opportunity to improve interventional breast care for women. On top of closing the Endomag deal, we continue to demonstrate that we are willing to bet on ourselves and repurchase shares. As a baseline, we are looking to offset dilution from our internal share plans. And from there, with our strong cash position, we look to layer on additional share repurchases. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 10.5 million shares for $750 million. We plan to continue on our capital allocation path and fully intend for our deployment strategy to include both M&A and share repurchases. And finally, before turning the call over to Essex, USPSTF. As we\u2019ve done for nearly 30 years in cervical cancer screening, no matter the direction the USPSTF may take for its cervical cancer guidelines, we will navigate the landscape and remain strong. Overall, we achieved our strong results by maintaining our long term focus and commitment to women\u2019s health. As we shared on our Q2 call, the strength of Hologic lies in the sum of our parts. We expect our results to continue to answer the call, and speak for themselves while we continue to demonstrate our durable strength quarter-after-quarter, year-over-year. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Essex to share insight on international growth drivers and more on Endomagnetics. Essex Mitchell : Thank you, Steve. Overall, our third quarter performance speaks to the successful implementation of our growth strategy, building multiple durable growth drivers into our franchises around the world. Today, we\u2019d like to quickly highlight three specific growth drivers from International Diagnostics and Surgical. These drivers are sometimes overlooked because of their strong market shares in the U.S., however we still have a great growth opportunity outside of the United States. That said, internationally molecular STI testing, cytology and MyoSure, all delivered nice growth in the quarter. This underscores the power of the sum of our parts, and reinforces our opportunity and ability to grow by expanding markets. Let\u2019s start with STI testing. The largest category in our global molecular diagnostics business. In the U.S., STI testing is our largest category and we have earned and maintained leadership for years. Internationally, we are still in the early days of leveraging our expanded Panther installed base. We have a sizeable opportunity to increase our share, not only in STI testing but across all categories where we offer testing. We have a long runway ahead of us as we continue to build the new markets we\u2019ve entered. With several irons in the fire, we expect to layer in more contribution over time, driven by more assays and more volume on our Panther systems. The same can be said for cytology and cervical cancer screening. In some regions of the world, we are bringing liquid based pap tests to the market for the first time and subsequently growing the market. While overshadowed by the U.S. revenue, international cytology, like STI testing, adds meaningful revenue that moves the needle over time. Shifting to Surgical and MyoSure, while MyoSure is still growing strong in the U.S., the MyoSure international growth rate is even higher. This is possible because international markets are vastly underpenetrated, and demand remains high for our minimally invasive option for treating uterine polyps and fibroids. In many regions, we are the first and only minimally invasive alternative to a complete hysterectomy. And it\u2019s our belief that all women should have access to minimally invasive options. All-in, while it\u2019s clear that certain products across our portfolio are more established in the U.S., what is not as obvious is that there are meaningful market expansion opportunities for these same products internationally. As leaders in these areas and champions for women\u2019s health, we are well positioned to capitalize on this global growth opportunity. And finally, before turning the call over to Karleen, I\u2019d like to provide more detail on Endomagnetics. As Steve mentioned, we are pleased to welcome the Endomag team to Hologic. 150 employees strong, and with seasoned management and R&D capabilities, the company has done an incredible job growing the business to what it has become today. That includes 500,000 plus women treated and adoption by over 1,300 hospitals in over 45 countries. Endomag products include Magseed markers for wireless lesion localization, Magtrace for lymphatic tracing, and Sentimag, a simple, easy-to-use handheld device to visualize both. The Endomag portfolio enables us to provide robust and differentiated offerings to meet demand in the growing interventional breast surgery market. From an investment perspective, the business directly aligns with our Breast Health franchise and has proven on-market products that are well accepted into clinical workflows. With our established, deep rooted sales channels we expect to amplify revenue growth well above our corporate average and also expect both margin and earnings accretion over time. Overall, we are excited to join forces and determined to go even further together. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you Essex, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, I will provide an overview of our revenue results, walk down our income statement showcasing strong performance, touch on certain key financial metrics, and finish with our guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal 2024. Our third quarter financial results were robust, once again exceeding our expectations on revenue and profitability, building on the momentum from the first half of the year. To recap high level results, total revenue came in at $1.11 billion, beating the midpoint of our prior guidance by $11 million. We delivered 3.1% revenue growth and organic growth of 5.8%, excluding COVID. In addition, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.06, growing 14.0% and exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by $0.001. Before moving on to our franchise results, we want to highlight the continued strength of our balance sheet. In Q3, we generated over $400 million in cash from operating activities, ending the quarter with $2.4 billion on the balance sheet, deployed $100 million on share repurchases, and announced the acquisition of Endomagnetics. We continue to demonstrate that our strong cash balance, leverage ratio well below our target range, and ability to generate cash consistently provide us the flexibility to fund innovation and pull both levers of our capital allocation strategy, tuck-in M&A and share repurchases, at the same time. Moving forward, we still have significant firepower to continue to deploy capital diligently, as opportunities arise. Turning to our franchise results. In Diagnostics, third quarter revenue of $440.8 million grew 0.7%. Excluding COVID assay and related revenue, worldwide Diagnostics grew by 6.0%. Within Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continues to contribute significantly, growing 10.5% excluding COVID. We continue to see underlying strength in BV CV/TV, which continues its outstanding growth trajectory and has become our second-largest assay globally. Additionally, as expected, non-COVID respiratory assay sales declined sequentially from Q2, in line with the flu season. However, year-over-year growth remains strong, highlighting the continued adoption of our four plex COVID, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV assay. And finally, Biotheranostics continues to be accretive to growth for our Molecular business. Rounding out Diagnostics, Cytology and Perinatal declined 2.9% globally, with U.S. declines partially offset by solid international growth, as Essex highlighted earlier. As a reminder, in fiscal Q3\u201923, customers built up cytology inventory levels in the U.S. due to third-party shipping constraints in Q2\u201923, leading to elevated sales in the prior year period. While the cytology business has largely returned to normal, year-over-year growth rates were impacted. Looking ahead, we expect flat to modest growth from the cytology business. Moving on to Breast Health. Total third quarter revenue of $385 million increased by 7.1%, or 8.2%, when excluding SSI. Within Breast Health, growth was primarily driven by Breast Imaging, with solid domestic and international results, contributing 7.2% and 12.1% growth, respectively, excluding SSI. Third quarter performance was driven largely by increased gantry shipments and robust Service revenue growth that continues to contribute meaningfully. Continuing next to Surgical. Third quarter revenue of $166.6 million increased 6.2%. Surgical growth continues to be fueled by MyoSure and the related Fluent Fluid Management System. Our Laparoscopy business, while smaller in dollars, grew significantly in the quarter and continues to progress nicely. Additionally, International continues to be a bright spot, growing just under 20% in the quarter. Finally, in our Skeletal business, third quarter revenue of $19 million declined 29.7% due to lower Horizon DXA shipments resulting from a temporary stop ship related to a non-conformance issue. We are working with our suppliers to resolve this situation and expect to resume shipments during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Now, let\u2019s move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin was 61.1% for the quarter, a 30 basis point improvement from the prior year period, even though COVID assay revenue declines continue to be a headwind. Additionally, gross margin expanded 40 basis points sequentially from fiscal Q2 primarily driven by favorable product mix. Total operating expense of $302.8 million in the third quarter decreased by 3.5%. This decrease was driven primarily by elimination of expenses related to the divested SSI business. Operating margin was 31.2% for the third quarter. The year-over-year increase of 230 basis points was driven by top line growth, expanding gross margins, and lower operating expenses. Sequentially, as expected, operating margins expanded 80 basis points from Q2, largely from lower operating expenses and higher gross margin in Q3. Below operating income, other income, net, represented an expense of nearly $3 million in our fiscal third quarter. Interest income is lower due to lower cash balances from the significant share repurchases we have completed throughout the fiscal year. Additionally, interest expense is up due to higher interest rates. Finally, our tax rate in Q3 was 19.75% as expected. Now let\u2019s move on to our Non-GAAP financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024. For Q4 2024, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $970 million to $985 million, and EPS of $0.97 to $1.04. For the full year 2024, our guidance assumes revenue of $4.012 billion to $4.027 billion and EPS of $4.04 to $4.11. Unpacking this guidance, we lowered the midpoint of our prior revenue guidance by $5 million, which represents about a $20 million headwind related to the temporary Skeletal Health stop ship previously mentioned, partially offset by our strong performance in Q3 and the inclusion of an estimated $4 million to $5 million of revenue from Endomagnetics, now that we have closed the acquisition. With respect to foreign exchange, we are assuming Q4 will have a headwind of about $3 million. For the full year, we now expect a slight tailwind of about $3 million. Turning to our franchises. We expect Diagnostics, Breast Health, and Surgical to grow mid-single digits in Q4 and full year fiscal 2024, excluding the impact of COVID. As a reminder, fiscal \u201824 has four fewer selling days compared to fiscal \u201823, which we estimate to be a headwind of more than 100 basis points for the full year. Starting with Diagnostics. In Q4, we expect our Molecular Diagnostics business to drive high-single digit growth, excluding COVID, as customers continue to adopt and drive utilization of our broad Panther menu. In Cytology and Perinatal, we expect growth in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. Sequentially, however, we expect the business to perform flat to Q3. In Q4 of last year, sales dropped below typical ordering patterns due to inventory buildup in Q3\u201923. We expect Cytology and Perinatal comps to stabilize in fiscal year \u201925. Closing out on non-COVID Diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of approximately $6 million in Q4 and $20 million (ph) for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be about $7 million in Q4 \u201824, and about $70 million for the full year. COVID-related items are expected to be about $25 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $105 million for the full year. Moving on to Breast Health. We remain on pace to grow the business mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. We expect to see solid gantry placements in Q4, continuing the steady performance we have delivered year-to-date. The demand for our portfolio of products and services remains strong, and we have solid visibility into gantry orders. Further, our confidence in delivering more gantries than last year remains high. We are successfully managing resource availability among both our install teams and our customers, as customers balance the need to meet elevated demand for screening and staffing constraints. Finally, in Surgical, we anticipate Q4 revenue to grow mid-single digits. We expect the growth to continue to come from MyoSure, Fluent, and laparoscopy division \u2013 business. Moving next to margins. Our guidance continues to assume a cadence of improvement moving into Q4, for both gross margin and operating margin, we remain on pace to exit the fiscal year in the low 60s for gross margin. Our guidance also assumes Q4 operating margins in the low 30s, and we are on pace to finish fiscal \u201924 between 30 to 31%, which includes the stub period of Endomagnetics. Below operating income, we estimate fiscal \u201824 other income, net, to be an expense of approximately $8 million in Q4 and $11 million for the full year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 238 million for the full year. To conclude, Q3 was another strong quarter for Hologic. We continue to deliver robust growth and quality earnings. As we approach the end of fiscal year 2024 and look ahead to 2025, we are excited by the performance across all our franchises and the additional strength provided by a pristine balance sheet. As always, our stakeholders can count on us to deliver while also advancing the state of women\u2019s health around the world. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Steve, probably the biggest inbound is just on the 4Q guide, obviously, Karleen talked a little bit there. It seems like a lot of it is around the skeletal piece. I guess just when you think about the core business going into 4Q. Has anything changed relative to a few months ago? Has anything gotten worse? It seems like it's all skeletal, but I just want to talk through the core business and how you're feeling about it into 4Q here? Stephen MacMillan : You nailed it, Patrick. It's probably a little alarming because of the skeletal piece, but the three core businesses are all going great, and it is completely a reflection of that. And we just had a little hiccup with the supplier issue in our Skeletal business. It is our non-core, but for Diagnostics, Breast Health, Surgical, we are feeling really, really good. Karleen Oberton : Yeah. And just, Patrick, just to add a finer point to it. Of the $20 million headwind, about $16 million is related to the fourth quarter specifically. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Karleen, maybe one of the questions we get broadly is on the margin profile as we work our way forward here. I think there's some fear that you guys could be a little more kind of heading towards the peak margin. Can you talk about, I guess, the 4Q piece, the moving pieces? You talked a little bit about the exit rate there. And just how you think about the build going forward when you think about the algorithm, the keys to getting that margin continuing to expand as we go forward and just broadly how to think about the jumping off point as we look to '25? Thanks so much. Karleen Oberton : Yeah. I think we'd like to ground people in the pre-pandemic operating margins at 31.5%. And I think as you see, as we exit Q4, we'll be right in that range and really thinking about that we've added a lot of revenue growth drivers that have a lower operating margin profile than the legacy business. So feel really good about achieving that as we exit 24. For the full year, '24, we'll be a little bit below that, as we said in our prepared remarks, between 30 to 31. But I have good confidence as we look to '25, we will be squarely for the full year at those pre-pandemic levels. And just to walk through some of the components, again, as I mentioned, the recent acquisitions will have lower margin profiles. The international business has a lower margin profile, and we're still working through some of the higher supply chain costs, primarily related to chips, as well as we integrate certain facilities, we have double costs. We\u2019ll see those primarily work through over the course of \u201825. Operator : We will take our next question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Tejas Savant : Hey, guys. Thanks for the time here. Karleen, I just want to follow up on Patrick's line of questioning there on the second question. Can you just help us think through sort of underlying algorithm for EPS growth, 5% to 7% for the top line, presumably, it stays intact for next year as well. As you think through the different buckets here, right, between the margin expansion piece, which you said it sounds like you're on track to achieve, but then you've also got repos. And then you've got a little bit of dilution from potential tuck-ins, including ones you might do in the next 12 months or so. So as we think about those multiple pieces in the context of EPS growth next year, is sort of high-single digit essentially a fair way to think about it or could it be a little bit better than that? Karleen Oberton : Yeah. So first of all, Tejas, I'll say that we have -- we're not giving guidance for 2025 at this point. We're still working through our budget cycle, and we'll be doing that in totality in the November call. What I would say at a high level when we think about earnings, yes, we want to grow earnings faster than revenue. So again, that 5% to 7% would lead you to the high single-digit, low double-digit earnings growth. And we do think about that as balance using the whole P&L, not just margin expansion, but share repurchase and potentially some favorability on the tax line as well. But again, we will be giving that full guidance on the November call. Tejas Savant : Got it. Fair enough. And then a quick follow-up on some of the recent tuck-ins here. I'll start with Boulder actually, perhaps for you, Steve. Could you just give us an update on where things stand and expanding from the pediatric setting there to the OB/GYN channel. Obviously, you flagged a lot more lap procedures there in the OB/GYN side. And then a similar sort of question, early days on Endomag but how should we be thinking about status quo in that market that Endomag can really help displace particularly in the U.S. where it's underpenetrated? And what's the feedback been like from physicians from any early conversations ahead of due course (ph)? Stephen MacMillan : Great. We'll kick that right to Essex to handle. Essex Mitchell : Great. Yeah. So I'll start with Boulder. And so we're seeing great success expanding outside of the pediatric channel. I would say our fastest-growing area is actually in thoracic with the reveal product. So we're seeing nice, it's an open product. We're getting to new customers, really honing in and focusing similar to our strategies that we've utilized with gynecology, where we focus on the specialty, really understand our differentiated position with the product and expand from there. So we feel really good about the success thus far with Boulder and still quite a bit of meat on the bone left, I would say, with pediatrics as we look to focus there moving forward. With regard to Endomag, very early days. I would say, we just closed, I feel really great about that team, excited to have them as part of the Hologic family and know that we'll do great things together. As far as feedback from customers don't have anything to comment on that right now, but feel really good about the prospects of this business, especially with the strong channel and relationships that we have today. Operator : We will take our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon. Wanted to focus on the diagnostic business here, starting with Panther. So I think I heard over 3,300 in the field now. So it feels like that stepped up a little bit. Pre-COVID, you were placing about 50 a quarter. I was wondering, if you felt like are you seeing any signs you might be getting back to those levels or still a bit of a COVID hangover on placements? Stephen MacMillan : Yeah, still lower on the placements. Clearly, this chapter of our growth, Jack, is expanding the utilization for Panther, but we are still seeing a modestly moving up, which we consider to be good. But yeah, not back at that pre-COVID level. Jack Meehan : Got it. Okay. And then on BV CV/TV, I think I also heard second largest assay globally. Would that put it in the quarter kind of a floor $40 million or so? And would you care to wager where this could land in terms of overall size at some point? What's driving the growth? Karleen Oberton : Yeah. I think that's a fair estimate of where it is. And I think we would -- I would be comfortable saying that it could be our largest assay someday. So to put it in perspective, there's still room for growth there. Stephen MacMillan : Okay. Operator, next question. Operator : We will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hi, Steve. Good afternoon. Congrats on the nice sprint and thanks for taking my question. I guess my first one on the skeletal ship home (ph) ratio. How -- is that in the backlog, Steve. So is this -- could this now be a tailwind for fiscal '25 or are those more like a lost revenues? Stephen MacMillan : It could potentially be a little bit of a -- it won't be lost revenue. I think we feel pretty good. There will be a couple of tiny ones. But overall, I think we feel pretty good. So it might be a modest tailwind for next year, but we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. But we're fixing it and feel very good. We'll be back in place by the beginning of '25. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Steve. And Karleen, maybe one for you on the margins here for Q4. Did that expectations change versus prior and mostly because of the deal and perhaps revenue push out? If so, what is the underlying jump-off point and is that a relevant number to be thinking of to be modeling the company? Karleen Oberton : Yeah. I think as I talked about, we'll end the full year between 30 to 31, which would give you something higher than 31 in the fourth quarter. I would say -- from an annualized basis, I'd jump off the midpoint of the 30 to 31 and think that we're going to get back to probably that 31.5 range. But there is some seasonality to margins. And typically, Q1 is our lowest operating margin quarter. So I wouldn't like spring off of Q4 to a higher number in Q1. Operator : We will take our next question from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group. Please go ahead. Anthony Petrone : Thanks and congrats on the quarter here. Maybe I'll just throw two out there quick. Just on cytology testing. I know the comps were a little bit bifurcated the last two quarters, but the business itself just generally has been a little bit lumpy. So maybe just what you're seeing there? Do you think there's any changing patterns ahead of the preventative task force rule? You also have the upgrade cycle with the digital platform. So just a little bit on the lumpiness in cytology. And then the second one on Panther utilization. Can you actually provide the range of assays used in the post-pandemic systems? I know the average is two, but where does that range sit? What is the upper end of that range and what is the lower end of that range? Where could it trend over time? Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Let me take the first part of that. The first part is, we are not seeing any shift in the market in terms of cytology usage, Anthony. It is -- really it's more because we changed a third-party vendor last year, it kind of made a little bit of lumpiness between the Q2 to Q3 last year comparisons, but the underlying is very consistent. And the initial stages on our digital cytology, which is further ahead in Europe, are looking very good, and we're in the early stages of some very positive consumer -- or I'm sorry, customer acceptance of that in the United States. So I think we continue to feel good about our cytology business. I\u2019ll pass it On the Panther utilization, we'll take... Karleen Oberton : Yeah. Sure. So Anthony, on the Panther utilization on the new customers, we talked about over 55% are running two or more assays. But when we look at U.S. in total, that we look at over a third of our customers are running four or more assays. So I would kind of anchor into that 4 -- 4 to 6is the likely target range. That over a third at the end of \u201823, compares to just under 20% at the end of \u201819. So you can see that growth that we\u2019re able to achieve as we drive utilization on the Panthers that are out there. Anthony Petrone : Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Great. Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Michael Matson : Yeah. Thanks. So I want to ask one on the cytology business, OUS. It sounds like that is a growth driver for you guys. But -- just want to kind of understand what's happening in those markets and what's driving the growth and kind of what you're seeing there with PAF versus primary HPV testing in the different regions of the world? Stephen MacMillan : Yeah. We're seeing some nice acceptance to our digital cytology. One of the challenges outside the United States is not as many cytologists around. And so the ability to help on the workflow is a big win and so rolling out our digital cytology, the genius cytology there is good. And we continue to work with guidelines. I think the hidden piece that's been missed for everything that we did in the pandemic to provide the COVID test, is we establish much stronger relationships across the world with ministries of health and everything else. And we're having more dialogues really that's going to benefit so many of our businesses, including our surgical businesses, our breast interventional business and really just shifting guidelines. And so there's more discussions. Germany has gone to a co-testing model in cytology and HPV over the last few years that we're benefiting from and working those angles really country by country. Michael Matson : Okay. Thanks. And then I think I heard currently Karleen call out tax rate as a kind of opportunity over the next few years. So your tax rate is a little bit on the higher side relative to some of the larger companies. So -- can you maybe elaborate on that? Karleen Oberton : Yeah. I think as we look at our operations and supply chain and even more specifically, continue to leverage Costa Rica for manufacturing, especially as we acquire new companies and optimize their supply chain, we try to leverage those points to contribute to favorability on the tax rate. Operator : We will take our next question from Casey Woodring with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Casey Woodring : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. So I wanted to talk about the strong molecular growth in the quarter here, that 10.5% number. One of the larger players in the molecular space that sits more in the point of care market has been seeing strong growth rates on the non-respiratory side as well now for several quarters in a row. This competitors called out sexual health and virology specifically as areas of growth. Just given your menu overlap, can you help frame up how the Panther is coexisting in the market now with some of these growing point-of-care platforms? And just your latest thoughts around any potential share shifts one way or the other in that market? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Stephen MacMillan : Yeah. I think we continue to feel really, really good that most of the screening is asymptomatic. It's standard testing that the economics are still going to work very well for the labs. And so I think we love our position. And there's always going to be people punching around on the edges that will help expand the market probably as well, but we feel really good about where we're going. Casey Woodring : That's helpful. And then just my follow-up here quickly, on that 5% to 7% top line algorithm, you previously talked about surgical is probably at the higher end of that range, rest on the lower and diagnostic somewhere in the middle when including cytology. So just -- is that the right way to think about 2025 on an ex-COVID basis? Maybe just walk through the moving parts there as you see them for next year. Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Yeah. Probably not quite ready to give individual line forecast for 2025, but I think we feel good overall. As any given year, any given quarter, any given business, maybe slightly above, slightly below, but I think we\u2019d like where we\u2019re headed. So we\u2019ll give you more of that detail, Casey, when we guide in November. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Thanks for taking the question, guys. Just a couple kind of loose ends for me. Going back to the skeletal, the stop ship. I think you talked about confidence that getting resolved in fiscal 1Q, I think you talked about $15 million in the fourth quarter. Just any sense of timing when in the quarter you're going to have it resolved? And just sort of if you could frame the range of outcomes there? Could this extend a little bit longer? Do you really have good line of sight on the resolution? Stephen MacMillan : We do have good line of sight. We're not expect it to go out far into Q1 of '25. So you should be able to count on it again. We'll guide by that point, but we fully expect to be back in the market by then. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And on the capital deployment side, you talked about balance sheet, strong free cash flow year-to-date. And then obviously, you've got both share buybacks and M&A kind of going on at the same time. Just remind us sort of how you frame those two options right now? Obviously, you just got a couple of deals under your belt recently, but still in a good position. So just going forward, priorities between the two and how you see that trading off? Karleen Oberton : Yeah. Certainly, as we look at our cash flow generation with a very strong balance sheet and very competitive credit agreement. Our focus is on deploying that free cash flow as well as the cash that we\u2019ve built on the balance sheet at this point in time. The priority continues to be tuck-in M&A, acquisitions that give us confidence in our ability to grow our revenue, hopefully accretive to our current growth rate. And then it would be share repurchase. As we\u2019ve stated in our remarks at a minimum to manage dilution from our equity plans and then opportunistic as we see disconnects and valuation in the market. Operator : We will take our next question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Navann Ty : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the M&A pipeline with your $2.5 billion cash available for acquisition? What are you seeing at the moment? And then also if you could discuss the innovation, including the next-generation gantry system in Breast Health and AI? Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : Sure. I think on the M&A front, we obviously were very pleased we closed the Endomag deal last week. We continue to look at other deals in that size a little bit bigger or whatever. But again, you can only make them when they're available. As we said last quarter, we'd love to do kind of one Endomag every quarter. It doesn't always work out that way. So we're in this great position of being able to be disciplined buyers as we continue to watch things shake out and also being able to redeploy on our own cash by buying back our own shares along the way. So it's not an either/or given the incredible cash position we have. So we like where we are on that. Karleen Oberton : Yeah. In regards to innovation, certainly, we've talked about a next-generation gantry that really continues to focus on workflow, patient experience and image quality. Those are the key drivers of innovation in that space and certainly layer on AI. How can we help the radiologist in assessing risk within those images and again, assessing or helping improve workflow is the use of AI, not only in breast but also in genius digital cytology. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Please go ahead. Ryan Zimmerman : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe Karleen, just to follow up on your next-gen gantry. I mean you made the comment today that you're on pace to grow gantries this year. And I don't know if you'll be comfortable answering this yet, but do you expect to grow gantries in '25? And coincidentally, can you just give any color on kind of timing of a next-gen gantry? Karleen Oberton : Yeah. I don't think we're going to give any specifics on timing, I think likely as we look towards RSA would be a time that we would highlight that for certain of our customers and probably give a little more specifics on what we're expecting for 2025 and beyond. Ryan Zimmerman : Okay. Just a follow-up, two quick questions. One, what's the status or impact that you're seeing from the BioZorb recall dynamics? How does that impact with Endo-Magnetic, if at all? And then the second thing that I wanted to just ask about, unrelated, was you've had a number of these deals. And to go back to kind of the earlier margin question, is there an opportunity in any way for some facility integration or manufacturing integration that hasn't been kind of contemplated or discussed yet? Because it would seem like with the number of deals you've done over the past years, there could be some low-hanging fruit there. And I just don't recall you guys really talking too much about that thus far. Thanks for taking the questions. Essex Mitchell : Yes. This is Essex. I'll jump in on the BioZorb question. So Endomag and BioZorb are completely unrelated from each other, number one. But number two, I would say, is that the BioZorb recall was more of an administrative recall where we needed to update our PI or language in our insert. So we are still selling our product, feel great about it and are working through that. With regard to facility integration, I don't know if Karleen wants to jump on that? Karleen Oberton : Yes. Sure. So as we\u2019ve highlighted, we\u2019re doing some facility integration in our Breast Health business right now. From each of the acquisitions, they all have different profiles. Some makes sense to stand alone as they are and others do make sense to integrate and they\u2019re in various stages of integration. And as we always do, we always look at our supply chain, look at our network and continue to focus on opportunities for optimization. And I would say, over the next five years, I think we\u2019ll continue to realize those opportunities. Operator : We will take our next question from Mason Carrico with Stephens. Please go ahead. Mason Carrico : Hey, thanks for taking the questions. On the molecular business, could you provide some color on how adoption is trending for the fusion sidecar recently. You doubled the Panther installed base during COVID. How has adoption really been among those new customers? And then as a follow-up, what are your expectations for where that fusion attach rate can move longer term? Stephen MacMillan : Yeah. We're seeing steady adoption of the Fusion sidecar, which is [indiscernible] it really opens up the menu. We're focusing on customer by customer. What we're seeing is quarter-over-quarter, more customers adopting the Fusion as we go along. It doesn't necessarily mean every Panther needs a fusion. And in fact, it will probably end up being, I don't know, maybe even a third of our total Panthers, even if that \u2013 what it really comes down to is does each customer have the capability. And so that\u2019s been our big focal point, and we\u2019re seeing good adoption and steady growth. Operator : We will take our next question from Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Andrew Cooper : Hey, everybody. Thanks for the time. A lot has been asked. So maybe just one, a little bit nitpicky on margins, but could you give us a little bit more flavor for the pretty modest change for the year, but just how much of a driver is Endomag flowing in versus maybe a little bit of a decremental from the skeletal headwind versus anything in the core in terms of as we think about that 4Q operating margin and full year operating margin for fiscal '24? Karleen Oberton : Yeah. So I would say, it's more geared towards the stop ship on the skeletal versus the Endomag. Think about Endomag as very small revenue for only two months, but certainly stop ship on even a noncore franchise is going to have an impact on margins. Stephen MacMillan : The way to think about it, too, is with that, I think our margins are still looking really, really good. Andrew Cooper : No, agreed. And then just one more again kind of on margins. But Karleen, I just want to make sure I caught something you said correct. I think you said something about working through chip costs and integrating facilities -- or the elevated chip costs, I should say, and integrating facilities through fiscal '25. Just wanted to get a sense, has anything changed in terms of how quickly you're working through those higher-cost chips and when you expect to be at kind of more normal levels in terms of the chip cost themselves? Karleen Oberton : Yeah. I think we're substantially through them as we exit '24 and probably be a little bit into '25. But I think what we're having is as we increase production overall, getting more favorable absorption than what we had prior when manufacturing was really reduced because of the chip supply. Andrew Cooper : Okay. Great. I\u2019ll stop here. Thank you so much. Karleen Oberton : The facility integration is -- yes, the facility integration in the breast business specifically will go through at least the first half of \u201825. Operator : We will take our next question from Lou Lee with UBS. Please go ahead. Unidentified Participant : Great. Thank you for taking my question. I think just a quick one on breast. I think you mentioned the pacement (ph) is pretty strong -- potential pacement is pretty strong in the quarter. I wonder if you can get like a specific number on the pacement? And then also, is it really back to the one-way, pre COVID one way? Karleen Oberton : Yeah. I don't think we've given specific numbers on gantries. Again, we've grown -- we have real confidence that the total gantries are going to grow year-over-year. We're not quite back to pre-pandemic levels, but we'll be at those levels in 2025. Unidentified Participant : [indiscernible] pacement, sorry. Karleen Oberton : I'm sorry, can you repeat that? Unidentified Participant : I'm sorry, yes. And any regional comment that you want to call out in the gantry pacement? Karleen Oberton : No, not specifically. Operator : And we will take our last question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda : Hey. Thanks, Steve. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I'll just round it out I'll round it out with one question. On the skeletal, I just wanted to confirm -- when you look at the market for bone density measurement and fracture assessment, has anything changed there competitively in your view? Just wanted to confirm that and get a view about [indiscernible] pushouts that you're seeing in the quarter? Stephen MacMillan : Yeah, we still feel great about the market and great about our products. This is truly a supplier [indiscernible] pickup on our smallest business, and we'll be through it within another quarter and right back to what we expect. And in the meantime, obviously, that the core businesses are all delivering very, very well, so that the total is still very strong. So \u2013 but yes, nothing different, Puneet, no concern about it. Puneet Souda : Okay. Super. Okay. Thank you. Stephen MacMillan : All right. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. And this now concludes Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shelly, and I am your operator for today\u2019s call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations to begin the call. Ryan Simon : Thank you, Shelly. Good afternoon and thank you for joining Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Essex Mitchell, our Chief Operating Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them, and a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding divested businesses and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year. And two, organic revenue excluding COVID-19, which further excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, other revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve McMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen MacMillan : Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue was $987.9 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.01. We closed the fiscal year with another solid with revenue above the high end of our previous guidance range and EPS at the midpoint. Our fourth quarter results underscore the durable growth of our business and our ability to consistently deliver. For the full fiscal year 2024, we posted $4.03 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $4.08. Before discussing our themes for today, we'd like to first reflect on the fiscal year we just completed. In 2024, we made great progress strengthening and growing our business. By leveraging our leading brands, we drove diverse revenue growth and delivered industry leading margins, all while generating exceptional cash flow. This enabled us to achieve broad based growth and expand our end markets. Thanks to our intense focus on workflow automation and identifying opportunities for better solutions. At the same time, we executed our M&A strategy effectively, while delivering differentiated solutions for our customers and further solidifying our durable competitive advantage as champions of women's health. We also continue to make progress and are still in the early innings of the large international opportunity that lies ahead. Going a level deeper, we have four highlights to share that reflect our progress. One, for the full year, our Molecular Diagnostics business grew 9%, excluding COVID, continuing its strong growth. These results should put to rest any concerns regarding Panther utilization in a post-COVID environment. Two, in breast imaging, we maintained our market leading position while effectively navigating through the impact of the global semiconductor chip shortage. Three, from an operating margin perspective, we finished the year at 30%, maintaining profitability in the top tier of our peer group with opportunities for further improvement in 2025. Regarding our M&A strategy, four, we have been patient, disciplined and notably more active recently as opportunities we've been cultivating have become actionable. More specifically, we acquired Endomagnetics in July and signed a definitive agreement in October to acquire Gynesonics. Both are tuck in deals that are straight down the fairway as it relates to our M&A strategy and fit nicely into our global portfolio. We are the right partner to maximize these business opportunities, helping to benefit more women with the innovative products from these deals. From a broader capital allocation perspective, in 2024, we fully funded key organic initiatives and continued to reduce our share count. Additionally, as part of our release today, we announced our intention to launch a new $250 million accelerated share repurchase program. Overall, we have the ability to consistently deliver value to our shareholders through solid top line growth, operating and net margin expansion and strong and strong cash generation and deployment. Now moving to our two themes for our call. One, reinforcing who we are and how we got here. And two, shedding more light on where we are today and where we're headed in 2025 and beyond. As we've said before, Hologic is a company you can count on. Over the past 10 years, our non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate is over 10%, a meaningful achievement. Despite changing markets and unexpected macro conditions over the years, we have consistently delivered. Looking ahead, there will be ups and downs, challenges and headwinds but we expect to deliver as we have over the past decade. Since joining Hologic in 2013, we have dramatically transformed our business through two important phases. First, we steadied the ship and firmly rooted our leadership brands across our three main franchises : diagnostics, breast health and surgical. Second, during the COVID pandemic, we added several growth drivers across each of our franchises, both organically and through acquisitions. Today, we have industry leading platforms in each franchise and some of the strongest commercial channels in healthcare. The common theme across these two phases of transformation is our ability to create markets, establish market leading positions and drive growth by generating new opportunities. Looking back, products such as the Panther, Horizon DXA, our ThinPrep liquid based Pap test, 3D mammography, NovaSure, and MyoSure all represented improvements on the standard of care and therefore new markets at the time of their introduction. These trailblazing product lines generated new opportunities, which we continue to capitalize on today. Building on our foundation, products such as the Panther Fusion, Breast Cancer Index, Genius Digital Cytology, AI in mammography, Fluent and Acessa leverage our established core businesses and enable more growth through market-creating innovation. That said, as an organization, we are never satisfied and consistently aim to create new essential innovations to make the best even better. Our culture and leadership have never been stronger as we continue to make a profound impact on women's health globally. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, we are excited about our durable revenue base, diverse mix of growth drivers including our latest in Endomagnetics, and the opportunity to further strengthen our new product pipeline through organic and inorganic opportunities. We anticipate 2025 to be another year we deliver on our commitments, positioning Hologic for even greater long-term success. Now, I will pass the call over to Essex. Essex Mitchell : Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks, I will highlight where we are as a business today including divisional level revenue performance and share insights into where we are headed. As Steve discussed, our success transforming Hologic has been underpinned by our ability to excel as market creators. Over time, our products and solutions become integral to our customers' operations. Across our franchises, we provide solutions that enhance our customer success by incorporating industry leading workflow automation. As our products significantly improve our customers' operational efficiency, we are more than just a supplier, we become a partner. Today, our portfolio includes several new products with considerable potential. These products span our franchises and geographies creating multiple layers of sustainable future growth. Coupled with our strong balance sheet, we have the firepower to add new growth drivers both organically and inorganically. We are confident that our robust portfolio along with future additions will enable us to grow sustainably and navigate the evolving market landscape with agility and resilience. Now shifting gears to our divisional revenue results for the fourth quarter. In Diagnostics, fourth quarter global revenue of $443.3 million grew 6.2% and 9.2% organically excluding COVID. Molecular Diagnostics remains a pillar of strength for the division, growing 9.1% and 13.2% excluding COVID. Molecular performance continues to be powered by our BV/CV/TV assay and biotheranostics business, both of which have runway for future growth. The divisions respiratory, 4-plex, COVID, Flu A, B, RSV assay also contributed growth for the quarter. For the full year, Molecular posted excellent global growth of 9% ex-COVID. This performance was again driven by BV/CV/TV as we continue to grow this market, moving testing for vaginitis to our FDA approved assays on our highly automated, high throughput Panther system. In addition, we continue to see accretive growth from our biotheranostics business as we drive adoption and expand coverage for the breast cancer index test. And finally, we are expanding the global footprint of our Panther Fusion system, allowing us to meet the need for high throughput molecular diagnostic respiratory testing, while also setting us up nicely as we build additional menu on the platform. Shifting to cytology and our perinatal business within diagnostics, we posted 0.7% growth in our fourth quarter. Since the FDA approval of our Genius Digital Diagnostic System or Digital Pap test, we've worked closely with our early adopting customers and they've given us great positive feedback on the system. This platform represents a significant improvement to the current Pap test workflows. It combines AI and advanced digital imaging to provide customers more sensitive disease detection and a streamlined efficiency, a digital AI assisted Pap test. We are proud to announce that our first U.S. Genius Digital Diagnostics customers went live in the fourth customers went live in the fourth quarter. This milestone is yet another example of Hologic understanding the needs of our customers and responding to changing market dynamics with essential innovation.Turning to Breast Health. Total fourth quarter revenue of $375.5 million, increased 6.2% or 5.3% organically when excluding SSI and Endomagnetics. Organic growth in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by increased breast imaging service revenue along with contributions from our gantry business and interventional products.In Surgical, fourth quarter revenue of $156.5 million increased 5.4% compared to the prior year. The period's growth was once again led by core MyoSure and the platform's complementary fluent fluid management system, helping to offset declines in our legacy domestic NovaSure business. In addition, our international surgical business continues to drive strong broad based performance, as we expand access to our technologies into new markets.And finally, in our Scalable business, fourth quarter revenue of $12.7 million decreased 54.9%. This result was expected based on the Horizon DXA stop ship we announced on our third quarter earnings call. As a reminder, this is a temporary headwind and we expect to resume shipping in the back half of our first quarter.Moving next to where we are headed, I will first comment on our international business and close with comments on our M&A strategy. From an international perspective, our efforts to expand globally have been broadly successful. Our international business is nearly 50% larger compared to 2019 with an accretive annual revenue growth. That said, the full potential of our international business remains largely untapped. While we have taken key steps and are more directed international markets than ever before, there is a vast international opportunity available to us that we are still in the early stages of realizing. Over a multi-year horizon, we see meaningful growth prospects for our international business as we continue to penetrate new regions and enhance our presence in existing ones. By leveraging our innovative products and strong brand reputation, we are well positioned to capture emerging markets opportunities, which we expect to be accretive to total company growth rates for years to come.Shifting now to M&A, it should come as no surprise that a combination of organic and inorganic innovation will add fuel for our future growth. Our M&A strategy continues to focus on pursuing tuck-in deals that align with our three franchises. We aim to identify and acquire assets that leverage our existing strengths, drive top-line growth and add accretion to earnings over time. Going deeper, we prioritize assets that nicely fit into our current market segments or near adjacent markets. We target strategic and high growth areas across our franchises to enhance our current market position and to build global durable growth portfolio. In summary, our M&A strategy is designed to identify and integrate valuable assets that drive incremental growth, reinforce our market leadership and deliver sustained value to our shareholders. By maintaining focus on our core markets, exploring adjacent opportunities and driving essential innovation, we believe we are well positioned to navigate 2025 and the years ahead. With that, I'll hand the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Essex, and good afternoon everyone. In my comments today, we will begin with an overview of our solid fourth quarter and full year financial results, providing more color on margin and capital deployment. In closing, we will finish with our fiscal 2025 guidance for Q1 and the full year. We are pleased to close fiscal 2024 by continuing to meet or exceed our commitments on both the top and bottom line. In our fourth quarter, total revenue was $987.9 million growing 4.2% over the prior year period and 5% organically excluding COVID. In addition, our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.01 growing 13.5%. For the full fiscal 2024, total revenue was $4.030 billion declining 0.2%, while growing 5.3% organically excluding COVID. And non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.08 growing 3%. Given the revenue headwind of the skeletal stop ship in Q4, we view these results as solid. More notably, for the second quarter in a row, we returned to top line growth for our total business as we continue to bend the revenue curve in a positive direction. Before moving on to the income statement, we'd like to highlight the continued strength of our balance sheet as well as our commitment to our capital allocation strategy. In fiscal 2024, we pulled both levers of our capital allocation strategy by completing a revenue accretive tuck in M&A deal in Endomagnetics, while also repurchasing 11.2 million shares for $808 million which includes a $500 million ASR completed in the second quarter. Over the course of fiscal 2024, we reduced our diluted share count by over 10 million shares, demonstrating our commitment to leveraging our strong balance sheet and cash flow to manage our share count and deliver EPS growth. Starting off 2025, as Steve mentioned, we remain confident in our business. We continue to leverage our ability to repurchase shares with the announcement of our intention to enter into a new $250 million ASR. With our strong operating cash flow, we are in excellent position to continue funding our priority organic investments as well as our capital allocation strategy. We exited the year with over $2.4 million in cash and investments on the balance sheet and we'll continue to pursue growth opportunities in fiscal 2025. As mentioned earlier on this call, we are off to a great start by signing a definitive agreement in October to acquire Gynesonics. We anticipate closing this deal in the first half of calendar 2025. Now on to the non-GAAP P&L for the fourth quarter, starting at gross margin. In Q4, gross margin increased to 61.5%, and up 110 basis points year-over-year, driven by broad based domestic revenue growth. We are pleased with this performance, having achieved steady expansion throughout the year while overcoming several headwinds, including the amortization of higher cost inventory of semiconductor chips and the headwind from the skeletal stop ship. Moving down the P&L. Fourth quarter operating expenses of $311 million increased approximately 2.4%. This increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of Endomagnetics in our fourth quarter results as well as stronger local currencies in our international business. Excluding the impact of Endomagnetics and FX, our operating expenses were approximately flat compared to the prior year. Altogether, fourth quarter operating margins finished at 30% and net margin was 24%, both representing a modest increase over the prior year. Below operating income, other income net represented a loss in our fiscal fourth quarter of slightly less than $1 million, better than previously anticipated due to lower net interest expense. Finally, our tax rate in Q4 was 19.75% as expected. Now let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the first quarter in full fiscal year of 2025. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $1.025 billion to $1.035 billion and EPS of $1 to $1.03. For the full year 2025, our guidance assumes revenue of $4.15 billion to $4.20 billion and EPS of $4.25 to $4.35. Help with constant currency modeling, we are assuming a foreign exchange tailwind of slightly less than $10 million for Q1 and $30 million for the full year. Our guidance assumes the recent trend of strengthening local currencies in our international markets continues in fiscal '25. Overall, for the full fiscal year, our guidance assumes organic ex-COVID growth of approximately 4% at the midpoint. We expect revenue growth to build throughout the year. In Q1, we will be impacted by several transitory headwinds, such as the stop ship in our skeletal business as well as strong prior year comparisons in Breast Health and Surgical. We are also planning conservatively around the respiratory season and the residual impact from recent hurricanes, including the saline IV fluid shortage that we anticipate will be a headwind to our more elective breast and surgical procedures. Now moving on to assumptions underlying our revenue guidance at the division level. For core diagnostics, we expect mid-single-digit growth for the full year, driven by our BV/CV/TV assay and the ongoing adoption of our Biotheranostics BCI test. Further, as Essex mentioned, we successfully launched genius digital cytology in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. We are excited to continue this rollout and the growth opportunity it represents. Regarding COVID and respiratory assay assumptions, given the inherent variability of the respiratory season, we continue to plan conservatively for both, while maintaining capacity to aggressively meet any surges in demand. In addition, fiscal 2024 saw COVID revenue transitioning to our 4-Plex respiratory assay in our base molecular business. In 2025, we anticipate lapping the benefit of this conversion. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to about $10 million in the first quarter and approximately $25 million for the full year. COVID-related items are expected to be about $24 million in the first quarter and approximately $95 million for the full year. Closing out our diagnostics business, we expect blood screening revenue of about $5 million in Q1 and about $20 million for the full year. Turning to Breast Health. Over the past two fiscal years, we experienced elevated growth rates as we gradually recovered from the global chip shortage. Moving past this dynamic in fiscal 2025, we expect the gantry business within Breast Health to return to more normal growth ahead of our anticipated next-generation gantry launch. In our Interventional Breast segment, we expect continued strong performance from our portfolio of disposable needles and markers, though partially offset by recent withdrawal BioZorb products from the market. Lastly, in surgical, we expect broad-based progress across our portfolio to offset anticipated domestic NovaSure declines. We also foresee strong international surgical growth in fiscal '25 and driven by deeper market access and market penetration opportunities. Moving next to margins. Our fiscal '25 guidance assumes both gross margin and operating margin expansion, highlighting our strong operational discipline and commitment to shareholder value. Thus, we expect Q1 gross margins around 60% and expect improvement of roughly 50 basis points over the course of the year. Additionally, we expect Q1 operating margins around 30%, with an expected increase of 50 basis points to 100 basis points throughout the year. We are in outstanding position given the current macro environment. Working down the P&L. We expect Q1 to represent our highest quarter of operating expense in fiscal '25. This is due to normal seasonal expenses, including larger marketing campaigns as well as sales and trade meetings. For the balance of the year, we anticipate quarterly operating expense to represent a modest increase over fiscal '24 as we include the addition of Endomagnetics business into our fiscal '25 guidance. Below operating income, we estimate fiscal '25 other income net to be an expense of approximately $10 million to $15 million in Q1 and an expense between $50 million and $60 million for the full year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.5%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $235 million for the full year. To conclude, our solid fourth quarter completes another successful year for Hologic. As always, our focus remains on advancing women's health globally and delivering durable long-term results. Entering fiscal '25, we are excited about the opportunities ahead. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Karleen, maybe you start where you finished it. Just on the margins, Karleen, can you talk through how to think about the year? Obviously, a lot of folks are anchored to kind of the 31.5% for the year. And I know there was a lot of focus as COVID finally gets cleaned up, land on that number. Can you talk about the moving pieces on the margin front for the year and kind of where we should be thinking about the year and then the expansion potential off of this as well? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So you talk about fiscal '25, Patrick, moving forward? Patrick Donnelly : Yes, correct. Karleen Oberton : Yes. So I think we talked about certainly some headwinds in the first half of the year that we think those are transitory in nature. And certainly, when we talk about the IV fluids shortage impacting surgical our most profitable business that gives you some of the first half challenges that we think are, again, transitory and we'll work through those over the course of the year. I think as we also think about the year, we've talked about network optimization opportunities that have been underway, we'll start to see more of a benefit from those as we exit the fiscal year. So those are some of the key items that we look to over the course of the year. And again, if you look at the full year revenue guidance, 4% at the midpoint to the full year lower than that. Certainly, in Q1 as we start off, that gives you a sense of accelerated revenue growth in the back year that's going to help that margin expansion at the end of the year. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Steve, maybe just on the Breast Health business. Can you talk about the outlook for the year. It sounds like maybe a new launch moving here on the gantry side, how to think about -- there's always risk and maybe a little bit of a pause before that or a replacement cycle on the back of it. So maybe just frame up how to think about Breast Health with some new products coming and what the growth could look like there? Stephen MacMillan : Yes. Thanks, Patrick. I think the reality of the new gantry is that's going to be more impacted in kind of '26, '27, '28 from revenue. We are in that year prior to the launch that it might be a touch slower on pure gantries. The flip side is, as our service business as the interventional business and particularly things like Endomag coming through, it's the magic of continuing to deliver. So probably be a little bit lower than the last couple of years, as Karleen mentioned. But still very solid and we still feel really good about the existing gantries and the customers we still have to go, but probably just a little bit lower than last year before it reaccelerates. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : I had a couple of diagnostic question. Backwards leaps over players here. First question, now that it is the end of the year, I was wondering, it sounds like Biotheranostics, BV/CV/TV, two of the key growth drivers here. Could you just give us a mark-to-market for the year, ballpark of what the sales were? And then, what your view is on kind of how much the level of growth you should expect in 2025? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So I'd say a couple of points on BV/CV/TV, I think we've talked about that as approximately our second largest assay. So it's going to be several hundred million dollars in revenue. Biotheranostics is not at that level. It's probably closer to the $100 million plus level. I would think about those as BBC a very strong double-digit grower will continue to grow double-digits in '25, probably a little lesser rate given the increasing base. And Biotheranostics, a solid double-digit grower in '24 and we expect similar in '25. Jack Meehan : And then, Karleen, you also talked about the transition you saw this year to the respiratory panel. And just trying to read through the lines, it sounds like you're expecting you re at least your initial assumption is that decline this year? Any chance you could give us a ballpark what that sales contribution was in 2024 and just assumptions there? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I mean it was definitely in the several tens of millions of dollars for the Plex assay. And so I think at this point, again, that was a transition from COVID revenue to this product. And so I think we're -- don't expect another transition year, if you will. So that's why it's a little bit of a headwind here as we think about the first half of \u201925. Operator : Our next question is coming from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group. Anthony Petrone : Coming back on the quarter here. Maybe one breast health and one on Gynesonics, the acquisition announced a couple of weeks ago. On Breast Health, just in terms of gantry rollout post RSNA and we think about next fiscal year, should we be thinking that sort of the 2014 to 2017 sort of installs from the 3D Tomosynthesis on initial product cycle, those would be up for renewal beginning next year? Or is there a bigger portion of that installed base that potentially is eligible for an upgrade? And then just on Gynesonics, the Sonata system, maybe just a little bit on how many systems already out there in the marketplace and just synergies with the existing GYN surgical portfolio. Stephen MacMillan : Yes. On the Breast Health piece, I would think it's going to be a rolling. I wouldn't expect some big bolus of the 2014 to 2017 all coming due. I think we're going to be phasing it out. And frankly, again, looking for more durable growth than the quick bullish of uptake. And then on Gynesonics. Essex Mitchell : Yes I can answer the Gynesonics question. So first, we won't go to any details on installed base or anything like that. And so we actually close. But what I will say is that -- we believe this really complements our portfolio and really aligns with what our surgical team is doing every day. So the same customers doing the same type of procedures that are historic -- hysteroscopic or trans cervical, which really aligns where our strength is at. So excited about it. We'll have a little bit more information once we close. Operator : Our next question is coming from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Steve, sorry -- if you're -- I missed the first part of the call. When I look at the guidance here, 3.4x to 4.7x ex-COVID, I guess, how do you make the bridge to the LRP of 57. Is skeletal still a headwind here in fiscal '25, anything else that we need to be aware of to draw the bridge from your current guide to the 5% to 7%? Karleen Oberton : Yes. So what you missed, Vijay, is talking about what we call transitory headwinds that we're experiencing here. I'd say, Q1 and potentially into Q2. Both the skeletal again, that we -- in our prepared remarks said we'd start shipping that in the latter half of Q1, so it's definitely a headwind here. And then we talked about being conservative on our respiratory products, again, given the seasonality of flu -- and then finally, the IV fluid shortages that as a result of the hurricanes, we do anticipate that this is going to be a headwind for our surgical and breast businesses that need those fluids. Here in Q1, and it could creep into Q2. So if you take all those transitory headwinds for the first half, you look at the midpoint of our guide for the full year much lower growth rate here in Q1 that gives you a sense that the back half is going to have accelerated growth on the revenue. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Steve, maybe on this IV flow shortage, none of the other metric companies have called us. I'm curious. Are you seeing something now? Or is this more of a modeling assumption? Stephen MacMillan : I think a few have mentioned it. And I think the other piece is, candidly, I'd remind you, we were the first one that called out the chip shortage. We've been the first to call out a lot of things, Vijay, as you well know, because we're very close to the business and we are seeing little pockets. I think the other part is our surgical business is very highly elective. And so part of what is happening is clearly Baxter's prioritize -- hospitals are prioritizing the emergency and non-elective procedures. So we expect we probably do have a slight more short-term, clearly, transitory impacted, again, nothing lurking beyond that as soon as we come bouncing back. And frankly, it could be a headwind that could turn into a tailing but we always want to be conservative going into starting the year. Karleen Oberton : Yes. Vijay, I would say at least three to four other med tech companies have called it out specifically. So we're not alone in this. Operator : Our next question is coming from Dan Leonard with UBS. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Lu] on for Dan. Just wanted to going back to the transitory headwinds, is it possible to kind of like quantify like what's the magnitude in shortages? And then what is in the kind of conservatism in the respiratory revenue? Just any more color that would be great. Karleen Oberton : Yes. I mean, we haven't quantified it specifically. I think from -- we've talked about the skeletal stop ship is roughly $5 million a month, so that might give -- we talked about returning to shipment in the back half. So that gives you a sense of what that could be. Certainly, conservatism in the respiratory could be in a range of at least $10 million to $20 million and on the IV fluid, I think that's still evolving and we really don't have a sense of that quite yet. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Got it. And then I wanted to touch a little bit on the share repo that you mentioned, the $250 million, is that going to happen entirely in one quarter? Or is that like a year or multiyear program? Karleen Oberton : Yes. We expect we're going to kick that off in the next couple of weeks here, and it should finish within our fiscal second quarter. So we'll have a prorated benefit, if you will, within the fiscal 2025 full year. Operator : Our next question is coming from Casey Woodring with JPMorgan. Casey Woodring : I was curious if you could break out the 1Q guide by business segment, just to help us understand the growth acceleration expected over the course here between segments? And then also, curious what you're expecting in terms of international business growth versus domestic sales in '25 and what the outlook is across the different businesses internationally? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I mean we haven't provided the specific detail, but if you think about -- we talked about those transitory headwinds. Least impact probably in diagnostics. So you think about diagnostics in the mid-single-digit growth for the first quarter, and you have the other businesses below that. Casey Woodring : And then just internationally as well, how you're thinking about that? Essex Mitchell : Yes. We expect international to grow at a faster rate than our domestic business. Casey Woodring : Got it. Okay. And then just maybe if I can fit in one quick last one. So you talked about leveraging some supply chain costs moving around to give you some tax benefit. Just wondering if there's anything baked in there from a supply chain perspective that 19.5% tax rate for '25 or if there's some upside to that number? Karleen Oberton : Yes. Casey, I would remind you that the 19.5% is lower than fiscal '24. We're taking it down 25 basis points. primarily related to limiting some of our foreign losses that weren't deductible. And of course, we're always looking at other supply chain opportunities or business opportunities to drive the rate. But I wouldn't say that we're ready to commit to anything lower than the 19.5% that's already lower than '24. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Mike Matson : So I want to ask one on vertical business. So NovaSure sounds like it's declining in the U.S. So can you talk about why and whether or not that's something that could be stabilized and you return to growth? Or is it going to be a perpetual decline? Essex Mitchell : Yes. What I would say is that for a number of years, the volumes of global endometrial operation across the market have been a slow decliner, we've continued to maintain our market share and do well in the space but we do see alternatives versus competitors become more prevalent such as IUDs and other things to control hormonal abnormal uterine bleeding. So as of right now, we do expect that to continue on a slow decline. We feel great about our ability to continue to grow internationally, which is expanding and has a nice growth rate with NovaSure. So expecting all-in to still put up market-leading results, but we do see it declining in the U.S. Mike Matson : Okay. Got it. And then just another one on the Gynesonics. I understand it hasn't closed. So I don't know if you can or you're willing or able to answer this. But I guess it looks like it's for fibroids, similar to MyoSure. So I guess, why won't -- why isn't this something that will cannibalize MyoSure to some degree? Is it used for different patients or different types of fibroids or something like that? Is that why wall or? Essex Mitchell : Yes, it sounds like you're right on it. It is for different fibroids. So we have large fibroids on the outside and in the wall the uterus with Accesa, small polyps and I say only up to type 2 fibroids, with MyoSure. There are six different types of fibroids, Gynesonics so it not a system fills the gap in between both Sonata -- or both Accesa and MyoSure. So it is attacking a different type of fibroid using a different technology than MyoSure. Operator : Our next question is coming from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Navann Ty : I have one on M&A. If you could discuss recent M&A environment in Hologic three segments. And maybe more broadly, your capital allocation priorities in 2025. Karleen Oberton : Yes. I would say that as Hologic M&A is within each division. So each division has their own business development teams that are out there identifying assets, cultivating relationships and hopefully, we're able to acquire assets before they jump into a process. And hopefully, assets that we're kind of the rightful owner of. And so I'd say there's no priority between divisions at this time. It's really about what is the best deal for Hologic. And I think we gave some examples on how Endomagnetics and Gynesonics fit nicely into our current portfolio. And we bring a point of expertise. And I would say, as we look to 2025, I think it's probably more of the same of what we saw in '24, a balance of M&A and share repurchase is what we're looking to do. Operator : Our next question is coming from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Hello. This is [John] on for Michael. I wanted to ask about the Panthers. What I believe is one of your manufacturing partners recent tier results, and I was wondering if that has something to do with how the Panther placements are going? I know that utilization and then the assay menu expansion is the way to the growth, but -- and I'm sure the level of placements is far different from what it used to be pre pandemic, but so I wanted to ask how that's been trending? Karleen Oberton : Yes, absolutely. I think this is something we've talked about for the last couple of years. We have an installed base of over 3,300 Panthers worldwide, which is significantly higher than what we had prior to the pandemic, and we had obviously, an accelerated placement of Panthers during that time. And as we expected, those placements have slowed. But no impact on the growth of the business. As we said, molecular diagnostics, excluding COVID grew 9% in fiscal '24, many years after the end of the -- post the pandemic. So continued strength with that business. Unidentified Analyst : Well, I mean, if you wanted to give me more color but I would have taken that. Stephen MacMillan : As you know, [Michael] and some people, I think, sometimes forget is we make all of the revenue on the assays, not on Panther. So I know that we've gotten some questions of investors that are thinking, gee, if we sell less Panthers is that showing a downturn. But as you know, it's a reagent rental model. So frankly, right now, the next few years are largely driving that assay adoption without having to even place a lot of Panthers, which is even better on the CapEx side. So it's a very good structure for us. Unidentified Analyst : And yes, and on that related note, any update to the statistics you provided in the past about 55 users having using two or more assays and 1/3 having four or more? Karleen Oberton : We haven't provided an update to that. And just in general, I would say that those trends continue to improve -- move in the right direction. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mason Carrico with Stephens. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Harrison] on for Mason. It looks like -- so last quarter, I believe you talked about some facility integrations within the Breast Health business. Could you maybe talk a little bit about the cadence or time line of how those integrations will play out this year and then the margin impact as we progress through the year? Karleen Oberton : Yes. We expect that migration to be completed over the course of which is it's great not only from a manufacturing but also R&D will be ceded there and some great synergies with the R&D teams. But we haven't provided specific improvements, but it is part of the improvement we will see over the course of the year. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Yes. Sounds great. And then so within Breast Health. Have we largely moved past the higher cost of chips at this point? Are we at a more normalized level heading into '25 or is there still a drag on margin earlier in the year relative to the back half? Karleen Oberton : Yes. We're probably on the tail end of that. There was wasn't just one ship. There was many, many different ships that have the issue. So there could be still a few working their way through the system. But I think as we go through '25, we will move past that. Operator : Our next question is coming from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Unknown Analyst : This is [Jason] on for Tejas. So just modeling-related questions. So in skeletal health, do you expect the supply change by the end of F 1Q. So how much of any of the sort of $15 million per quarter loss, can we expect to be recouped in fiscal year 2025 on top of the base sales expectations? And then on BioZorb, could you quantify the financial impact from removing this product for fiscal year '25? Karleen Oberton : Yes. The BioZorb impact is deminimis, it really as a revenue line item that was less than $10 million in '24. So pretty deminimis. And I think on the skeletal, I think what we're really focused on is getting this back on the market and satisfying our customer demand. I wouldn't project right now that there will be some level of pickup. Again, we need to get it back to shipping status here in the first quarter. Operator : Our next question is coming from Conor McNamara with RBC Capital Markets. Ricardo Moreno : This is Ricardo Moreno for Conor. I have a question about as normal growth returns to the gantry business. How does that coincide with earlier the chip shortage that was experienced with the gantry business intersecting with equipment upgrades and replacement cycles? Karleen Oberton : So what I would say is, as we're kind of through the chip issue and I think we covered that in the prepared comments that as we get into '25, we expect more normalized growth rates. With potentially a little bit of headwind, again, as we anticipate this next-gen gantry. But as Steve talked about, we don't expect a significant increase in that conversion cycle given that technology improvement, software improvements, AI has been available to customers in our installed base over the past several years. It's been very intentional that our R&D efforts were producing upgrades that were backwards compatible to the installed base so that we didn't create this pent-up demand. So I think we're really going to move into a more normalized replacement cycle or an ongoing replacement cycle here in the U.S. which is a great business to have that steady state. Ricardo Moreno : Fantastic. And coming from FX comments earlier about the international business and focus there. How does that roll in, in terms of reaching the pre-pandemic operating margin goal of 31.5%. Usually, those -- traditionally, those margins have been a bit lower than 30%. Karleen Oberton : Yes. Well, I think as we've talked about our guide here from fiscal 2025, starting at 30% and expecting some improvement of 50 basis points to 100 basis points over the course of '25. I think you see a really nice balance of us continue to drive improvement in margins where we can. While we know that international is getting bigger and that's usually dilutive to the margins, but as international continues to grow, they have their own opportunities to create leverage on their operating margin line. So it's an ongoing balance and we see -- we're really pleased about what we expect for 2025. Operator : Our next question is coming from Andrew Brackmann with William Blair. Maggie Wilmouth : This is Maggie Wil on for Andrew today. Maybe one on Biotheranostics, I know you spoke to earlier, you're expecting kind of that double-digit growth that you saw in fiscal '24 for fiscal 2025. But how should we be thinking about the contribution from that to growth moving forward? And just where do you feel like you are in terms of that opportunity? Karleen Oberton : Yes. I think we think it's still early innings on that opportunity. I think there's it's pretty low market penetration at this point, but we haven't given guidance beyond '25, but to say that it's still early innings. Stephen MacMillan : It certainly seems accretive to our company for many years to come, as are most of the acquisitions we've been doing over the last few years. Operator : And our final question is coming from Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Andrew Cooper : Maybe just one more on the margin side to the degree you can help sort of frame the swing factors of adding that 50 bps to 100 bps over the course of the year, how much of that is just these transitory items getting lapsed by the time or resolved by the time you get to the fiscal fourth quarter versus the network optimization and other things you called out in one of your earlier answers. Karleen Oberton : Yes. We haven't quantified them specifically, but certainly, they are contributing to kind of lower margins here in the beginning, the first half of the year. But again, we view this as transitory and as they clear, we'll reap that margin benefit. Operator : Thank you. And this now concludes Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. And welcome to the Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lisa, and I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call. Go ahead, sir. Mike Watts : Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining Hologic's first quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Essex Mitchell, our Chief Operating Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our Web site. We will also post our prepared remarks to our Web site shortly after we deliver them, and a replay of this call will be available on our Web site for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we'd like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are organic revenue, which we define as revenue, excluding divested businesses and revenue of acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year. Also, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which further excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, other revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Steve MacMillan : Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to begin today by welcoming Mike back to the Hologic team. We are all excited to have him back. And now we are pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. As we pre-announced last month, total revenue for the quarter was $1.022 billion, an increase of 1% on a constant currency basis. This was in line with our guidance as the stronger dollar subtracted about $9 million from reported revenue since we guided in early November. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.03 at the high end of our guidance range and an increase of 5%. This reflected strong improvement in non-GAAP operating margins of 90 basis points as well as share buybacks and benefits of our foreign exchange hedging program. In my remarks today, I'd like to revisit some of the themes from our presentation at the JP Morgan conference last month. In that discussion, we reflected back on Hologic's strong financial performance since 2014. Our main point, however, was not about the past, it was that we believe we can continue to grow revenue and earnings at similar rates in the future. Why do we believe that? Because of our market leading products and the strong organizational capabilities we have steadily built around them. To be more specific, from 2014 through 2024 Hologic grew revenue from about $2.5 billion to more than $4 billion. This represented a compound annual growth rate of 4.8%, including all our acquisitions and divestitures along the way. Over the same period, non-GAAP earnings per share increased from $1.46 to $4.08, representing a CAGR of 10.8%, more than double the rate of sales growth. At JP Morgan, our primary message was that we believe we can continue to grow earnings at a double digit rate in the future. While some years like this one may be below this level, we are confident in our future and still believe this is an appropriate long term goal. The financial algorithm that will get us there includes a continuing of mid-single digit growth on the top line, modest expansion of our already best-in-class operating margin and a healthy mix of acquisitions and share buybacks to increase our revenue and EPS growth rates. The foundation for this expected performance, of course, lies in our market leading brands, which generate a tremendous amount of reliable cash flow. From Panther, Aptima and Thin Prep in Diagnostics, to Genius and Breast Health to MyoSure and NovaSure and Surgical, we enjoy leading market shares that have proven durable over time. Much of our growth comes from building around these brands and using the cash they generate to drive future innovation. For example, we now have more than 20 assays on our Panther and Panther Fusion platforms. We have built a reliable service business in Breast Health that is now larger than our capital sales, which can be more volatile. And we are adding products to our Surgical division, both organically and inorganically to leverage our excellent sales channel. Best-in-class products don't just happen. Instead, they are the result of several organizational capabilities that we have very deliberately built and nurtured over time. And these capabilities give us confidence in our ability to hit our financial targets in the future. For example, our 7,000 employees around the world are motivated by a passion for women's health. They have demonstrated an ability to create and expand markets for the benefit of patients and customers and to redefine clinical standards of care. Examples include transitioning traditional Pap testing to liquid Pap and now adding digital capabilities to catch more cancers and improve workflow. And more recently, we have partnered with our customers to literally create a market for high throughput vaginitis testing, which has fueled our second largest molecular diagnostics test on the Panther system. Many of these successes originated in the United States but we have now built the capabilities to grow internationally on a consistent basis. We continue to go direct in more geographies and businesses, most recently in our Surgical division while strengthening our market access capabilities around the globe. Similarly, we have learned from past mistakes and improved our business development capabilities. We have strengthened our talent and processes for conducting due diligence on new targets, cultivating relationships with them and integrating acquired assets more effectively. This internal maturation have been reflected in the solid performance of some of our more recent acquisitions. For example, Biotheranostics, Endomagnetics and Gynesonics should all boost our revenue growth rate. These organizational capabilities give us confidence in the future, especially our ability to a consistent double digit earnings compounder and deliver value to shareholders reliably over time. Now I will turn the call over to Essex. Essex Mitchell : Thank you, Steve. And good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will first review our divisional revenue performance in the first quarter. Then I'll provide a little color on Gynesonics, a tuck-in acquisition we recently closed in our Surgical business that we are excited about. As Steve said, we met our revenue guidance on a constant currency basis in the first quarter growing 1%. At the highest level, we outperformed in diagnostics but lagged in Breast health. Surgical and Skeletal were roughly in line with our expectations. Our Diagnostics business continues to be one of the best performing diversified asset in the space and Q1 was another strong quarter. Revenue of $470.6 million grew 5.2% and 9.1% organically excluding COVID. Growth for the division continues to be led by molecular diagnostics, which grew 6.7% or 11% excluding COVID. Within molecular, our Biotheranostics lab testing business continued to grow at a healthy double digit rate and our BV CV/TV assay also had another outstanding quarter of strong double digit growth. We believe we are only in the middle innings of realizing the total opportunity for this test. For example, we have just begun using our physician sales force to expand the vaginitis testing market in the US, leveraging the same playbook we have used to grow our legacy women's health test. Our core women's health assays that run on our automated Panther platform also had a strong performance in the quarter. We often get investor questions about competition in diagnostics. So I want to be clear that these assays have held leading market positions for some time and our sales force continues to win new business and grow that share despite an always competitive environment. Although respiratory testing is a relatively small piece of our business, it is seasonal and can vary significantly based on flu prevalence. This quarter, the respiratory season started slowly but worsened in late December. As a result, non-COVID respiratory sales finished close to our expectations for the quarter. These respiratory tests as well as many of the other assays we have in development run on our Panther Fusion sidecar. For our customers, having a Panther Fusion is the key to unlocking our full menu. We have been pleased to see our sales force grow the attachment rate of the Panther Fusion in recent quarters. Nearly 40% of our US customers now have a Fusion system. In our cytology and perinatal business within Diagnostics, we saw higher than average growth of 4.7% for the quarter. As a reminder, sales in the prior year quarter were slightly depressed, resulting in an easier comp for the current period. Moving to Breast Health. Total first quarter revenue of $369.1 million were disappointing. Sales declined 2.1% or 5.8% organically when excluding SSI and Endomagnetics. The decline versus prior year was primarily driven by lower sales of capital equipment. However, we continue to see strong growth in service revenue tends to be more steady than gantry sales, reflecting our long term strategy to diversify revenue in this business, service accounts were more than 40% of sales in Q1. As we've analyzed the Breast Health market recently, we have concluded that 2025 will be a softer year for gantry placements than we initially expected. This is for a few reasons. As we recovered from the chip shortage, we saw multiple quarters of sustained double digit growth in mammography [indiscernible]. This clouded our picture of what a normal gantry market would look like entering 2025 and made for tough comps. Now that we have upgraded most 2D units in the United States to our 3D standard of care, our challenge is to drive 3D to 3D conversions. In this context, we are seeing customers lengthen their replacement cycles, especially those who are considering our new Envision platform, which we expect to launch commercially next year. On the bright side, our competitive position remains strong and we have received very positive feedback from Envision since we introduced it at RSNA, which gives us long term confidence. Customers are excited about the systems, better image quality, patient experience and workflow. Outside of the United States, we are also seeing pressure on capital investments as many private and government hospital customers struggle with local budgetary constraints. Turning to our interventional breast business, we are pleased with the integration and performance of Endomagnetics, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and is well positioned for a strong year. We are excited about Endomag's innovative [indiscernible] market products but also its R&D capabilities, which will provide opportunities to further broaden our interventional breast portfolio. In Surgical, first quarter revenue of $166.3 million increased 2.5%. Q1 was another strong quarter for our International Surgical business with growth of nearly 20%. In the US, results were in line with our expectations considering the temporary headwind of the IV fluid shortage that we discussed on our Q4 earnings call. Most of our customers saw their IV fluid constraints resolved as we exited the quarter, so we do not expect to have -- this to have a significant impact going forward. Finally, in our Skeletal business, first quarter revenue of $15.8 million decreased 37.4% as shipping for some of our Horizon DXA units resumed later in the quarter than originally anticipated. We expect the manufacturing of these units to progressively ramp up to full capacity before returning to normal in the third quarter. Before I hand the call over to Karleen, I wanted to highlight the Gynesonics acquisition that we completed in January. We're excited to introduce their SOMATEX system into our surgical portfolio. SOMATEX is a minimally invasive radio frequency ablation tool used to treat uterine fibroids that are less accessible by MyoSure or Accesa. So it's highly complementary to our current portfolio and fits nicely into our sales bags of the largest commercial channel we have. Gynesonics had about $28 million of revenue in its most recent fiscal year, including a healthy mix of international sales. We expect sales to grow at a healthy double digit rate in the hands of our large Gyn sales force. Gynesonics' gross margin is solid, although planned investments will make the acquisition slightly dilutive to non-GAAP EPS this year. As Steve mentioned, strengthening our business development capabilities has been a key focus for the organization in recent years. In each division and at the corporate level we now have teams in place that bring a deep understanding of the respective end market and significant experience in diligence and integration. The success of recent deals like Biotheranostics, Endomagnetics and our good start with Gynesonics give us confidence in our ability to identify and integrate future deals. As we've said many times, accessing high growth adjacent markets through successful M&A will be key to our growth strategy moving forward. With that, I'll hand the call over to Karleen. Karleen Oberton : Thank you, Essex. And good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will start by walking through the rest of our non-GAAP income statement, then touch on several key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for fiscal Q2 and the full year. Let me begin by saying we are pleased to grow non-GAAP earnings per share by 5% this quarter when revenue only grew 1%. Although we clearly want revenue to grow faster and we believe it will, this demonstrates the substantial operating leverage we can generate and gives us confidence that we can grow earnings at a double digit rate over time. So how did we do that in the first quarter? Start, non-GAAP gross margin of 61.6% increased 80 basis points. This margin expansion was primarily the result of favorable product mix and operating efficiencies. Moving down the P&L. First quarter operating expenses of $329 million increased approximately 0.5%. As a reminder, Q1 usually represents our highest level of operating expense for the year due to several large commercial initiatives. Despite this, the year-over-year increase was driven by the addition of Endomagnetics. Excluding Endomagnetics, operating expenses would have decreased 2.3%. First quarter operating margin finished at 29.4%, representing an increase of 90 basis points. This operating margin expansion came primarily from drop through of our higher gross margin and good expense control. As Steve said, leveraging the P&L to drive modest margin expansion from already best-in-class level and strong EPS growth remains a key focus. Below operating income, other income net loss in our fiscal first quarter by slightly more than $4 million. This result was better than expected due to the benefit of our foreign exchange hedging program. As a reminder, this hedging program seeks to minimize the negative or positive bottom line impact of currency fluctuations. Finally, our tax rate in Q1 was 19.5% as expected. Altogether, net margin for the quarter was 23.4%, approximately flat to the prior year and very strong relative to our diagnostics and med tech peers. Because we have tremendous confidence in our long term future, we continue to bet on ourselves and use our balance sheet to enhance shareholder value. In the first quarter, we repurchased 6.8 million shares for a total of $517 million, including the completion of the $250 million ASR announced on our Q4 earnings call. As a result, we brought our weighted average diluted share count down to $232 million, a decrease of 8 million shares compared to the prior year. All of this led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03, which we were pleased to deliver at the high end of our guidance range. With strong operating cash flow of $189 million in the first quarter and $2 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter, we are well positioned to continue to execute our capital deployment strategy to drive both top and bottom line growth. Now let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full fiscal year and for the second half. I'd like to start by acknowledging the dramatic shift in the geopolitical and macro environment since we first provided guidance in early November. As everyone knows, we are seeing an immediate impact from the new administration in the US, both in terms of policy changes and a strengthening US dollar. Entering the new calendar year, we also have greater visibility on our end market landscape for 2025. Combining these pieces together, we are using this opportunity to reset our financial expectations for the year. For the full year, we are lowering our revenue guidance range by $100 million to $4.05 billion to $4.10 billion but we are maintaining our non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.25 to $4.35. Our Diagnostics and Surgical businesses are performing well and we are adding roughly $25 million of Gynesonics' revenue to our reported results. However, these positive developments are being offset by three factors. First, like everyone else, we have experienced a significant strengthening of the US dollar since early November. We now expect FX to represent a headwind of $30 million for the full year. This represents a swing of more than $60 million from our original expectations, which we are baking into our reduced guidance today. Second, we are expecting lower sale of our Breast Health capital for the year. As Essex detailed, we didn't have a clear picture of the gantry market, which led to two aggressive forecast for 2025, especially considering that our next generation gantry is still a ways off. Third, two potential policy changes in the new US administration are introducing uncertainty in our business. First, the freeze on foreign aid has affected our main partner for HIV testing in developing countries. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Release or PEPFAR. Although PEPFAR has been granted an exemption based on the life saving work they do, activities on the ground have still been disrupted. This disruption could affect our revenue by as much as $30 million for the balance of our fiscal year. Second, contract manufacturers in Mexico make our Skeletal and Gynesonics products. So we could be subject to tariffs that lower our gross margins as we import them into the United States. Although these are relatively small pieces of our businesses and the tariffs have been delayed for now, we believe it is appropriate to risk adjust our forecast for the potential impact. Despite these headwinds, we are maintaining our full year EPS guidance of $4.25 to $4.35. The strong financial discipline and capabilities we've established as an organization are enabling us to mitigate the bottom line impact of these issues. For the second quarter, we are expecting total revenues in the range of $995 million to $1.005 billion, including a $10 million FX headwind and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1 to $1.03. Now let me provide some additional details that underpin our guidance. In terms of quarterly pacing, we expect our revenue growth rate to improve in the third quarter and further in Q4. So we should exit the year above our long term mid-single digit target on a quarterly basis. In terms of the divisions, we expect Diagnostics to grow mid-single digits for the year, excluding the impact of declining COVID-19 sales. We continue to forecast that growth will be driven by strength in our molecular women's health assays and Biotheranostics' lab testing. For COVID revenue, we expect assay sales to be about $9 million in the second quarter and approximately $35 million for the full year. COVID related items are expected to be about $25 million in the second quarter and approximately $100 million for the year. Finally, in Diagnostics, we expect led screening revenue of about $5 million in Q2 and about $20 million for the full year. As you know, both COVID related sales and blood screening revenue are backed out of our organic growth calculation. Within Breast Health, as mentioned, we are lowering our expectations for the full year based on softer capital equipment sales. We now expect this business to decline in the low single digits for the full year, including Endomagnetics. We do, however, expect revenue growth to build in the second half with good year-over-year growth in Q4 as we exit our fiscal year. Lastly, in Surgical, we expect high single digit growth for the year with the inclusion of Gynesonics in our results for the three quarters. In our core surgical business, we expect growth to be powered by international with contributions in the US for MyoSure Fluent. Moving to the rest of the P&L, we expect gross margin in the low 60s for the full year. We anticipate gross margins to step up in the second half with higher sales, the elimination of redundant manufacturing facilities in Breast Health and direct sales in Endomagnetics. For operating margin, we're expecting to be in the low 30s for the full year with steady margin expansion as we move through the year. Below operating income, we estimate other income net to be an expense of $10 million to $15 million in Q2 and an expense between $40 million and $45 million for the full fiscal year. Our effective tax rate of approximately 19.5% for the full year remains unchanged from our prior guidance. To reflect the share repurchase activity we completed in Q1, diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 230 million for the full year. To conclude, our financial discipline and strength have us in a position to meet our EPS commitments even in a year where we're seeing pressure on the top line. We believe these pressures are largely transitory in nature and we expect top line growth to be healthy as we exit the year. We feel great about the long term outlook for each of our divisions, driven by our ability to retain and grow our market leading positions while continuing to add new growth drivers through internal innovation and business development. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Steve, maybe starting on the gantry side, not surprisingly, you've obviously lived through a lot of different CapEx cycles on the hospital side. Maybe just take us through what you're seeing there? How much of it is again, maybe a little bit of a pause before the product launch? Just the right way to think about that piece as that number came down a little bit, just wanted to talk through that? Steve MacMillan : Well, why don't we try to put it into context. I think where we really frankly missed the boat a little bit was when we had three quarters in a row of 27% plus Breast Health growth in the late '23 and into early '24 period, that was really a bolus that made the market bigger during that time period than what the long term trend is. It's a little bit like even Surgical had a couple of great orders coming out of COVID, and Breast Health had the same thing coming out of chip. So we had that year -- '23, we grew at 17% plus for the full year, grew another 6% on top of that last year. And I think instead of really going back and looking at the longer term trend of the market, we were just building on top of that. So the long term trend of the market is clearly below what it was in 2023. Now I think what we're seeing this particular year is the total market, therefore, is probably going to be down a little bit, just as we saw in some of the other businesses kind of post COVID, we'll see the same for chips, combined with the fact that we've got a new gantry on deck. So I think the positive as we look at it is probably going to be a down market this year for the overall market globally but we've got something on the horizon that I think will both reaccelerate the market in '26 as well as reaccelerate our business. So that hopefully frames it in some good context. So I think it's more cyclical clearly. And you know that we've got a long track record of being able to call out either cyclical or structural issues usually with pretty good accuracy. So I think this one is very clearly a little cyclical. Patrick Donnelly : And then maybe one on the diagnostics side, helpful to perhaps some more color on the script there on just what you're seeing on the competitive side. We get some questions there, clearly you do as well. Any changes there, whether it's BV CV/TV or other parts of the portfolio that the competitive landscape has changed at all? And then just curious when we think about the growth outlook there, the key thing in the pipeline we should be focusing on that could supplement the growth as we move forward here? Steve MacMillan : Good job, Patrick, working several questions into your one follow-up. So kudos to you. So high level, I can't tell you how excited we are about our Diagnostics business. And what we said when we went into COVID by placing all the Panthers around the world and even as we saw the ups and downs, as Omicron, Delta, everything else was hitting, we just systematically got stronger in terms of our Panther placements and then rolling out the menu of particularly BV, CV, where we've rolled out a new assay and then we've created the market. And we're still, as Essex mentioned, we're still in the mid-innings at most as it relates to the BV, CV opportunity. And I think when you look at our molecular business and you add in Biotheranostics, I don't think I've ever been more excited about where this Diagnostics business is going, particularly in a world where there's a lot of noise, as you well know, in the diagnostic space right now. And the way we try to look at it is that core molecular lab channel are we winning or losing, and we feel really good about our position as we as we build out from there. And then we've still got the international opportunities on top of it all and still a lot of growth in Biotheranostics as well. So Karleen? Karleen Oberton : I would just add on to that as far as -- but I'll call our special sauce in our molecular diagnostics that physician sales force where we really partner with our lab customers to promote guidelines. And I think as we said in our prepared remarks, we're just starting now with BV, CV. So that's what gives us confidence that there's still runway for growth for that new assay. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group. Anthony Petrone : Maybe a high level one, just for the long term sort of medium term financial outlook. I mean Steve and/or Essex. When you think about that mid-single digit sort of profile, I think -- and we look at the last time that range was out there was 5% to 7% and we're trending here, obviously, in the low single digits right now. We're in a low point of a cyclical gantry cycle here. What sort of gets you back to 5% to 7%, how long do you think that will take and what amount of that will come organically versus inorganically? And then quickly, just on the second one, Diagnostics. Late last year, you had H5N1 bird flu development CBC. It sounds like that actually could be an assay this year. Is that something we should expect? Steve MacMillan : Yes, I think the highest level I kind of laugh a little bit in that as you all, we put out the 5% to 7% for a three year window, the '23, '24, '25 window. In our very first year, we probably delivered about 17% organic in that year and everybody was challenging us to raise that number. And effectively, what we're really saying is we're mid-single digits, and this year, frankly, just for a few quarters, we think we're below it, not for the full year to be below that but just as it was way above, we said we weren't that good we're also not as bad in a cyclical period where we're recovering from the -- frankly, a lot of those big comps. So what gives us excitement going forward really is each franchise, right? The surgical business keeps strengthening and the addition of Gynesonics, the international expansion there is looking great. Our Diagnostics business, as we've said, is great. By the way, we'd love to view that H1N1 is going to be anything. I probably put this one in my world, kind of like the Zika virus. We're always there for the government and for the CDC to be one of the quickest to develop any of these. And even as we did in COVID right at the beginning, we didn't know it would amount to anything. Obviously, that would have amounted to something very big. I wouldn't assume a lot for H1N1. If that came, that would be upside to our business. And then the Breast Health business, as we continue to build out the disposable side of the business, the interventional side with things like Endomagnetics. And then as the new gantry kicks in next year, I think that gets us back very solidly into our longer term consistent trajectory in that mid-single range of top line growth. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Doug Schenkel : Two, that I'd like to touch on. One is it's just a little bit unclear to me how much of the change in your assumption that you've embedded into guidance for Breast Health as a function of market conditions versus a reassessment of the impact of market stalling in advance of the new gantry launch? If it's more stalling that lead to a big acceleration in revenue growth down the line if it's a market that's something else. So could you just provide a little more color there? And then the second topic is really M&A. In your prepared remarks, you talked about the importance of M&A as part of the long term strategy. Can you just provide any updated thoughts on, one, the environment given the new administration and two, what parameters you're using in assessing potential targets, revenue growth, margins, accretion, ROIC? Steve MacMillan : I'll start with the breast comments here. So I do think we tried to outline that it is a blend of both market conditions and given our high market share, our new launch slowing the market down. But if you had the weighted, I would say market conditions are the bigger impact. And so that does give us confidence about our future moving forward and do expect this business to accelerate as we exit the year moving forward. The big thing I would say is that if you think about coming out of the chip shortage with a significant amount of pent-up demand we got through a ton of that, I would say, over the '23 and '24 time period. In addition to that, as we've seen other areas of acceleration, those were driven by large innovation advances, primarily driven by us. And so when you saw going from the to 2D the 3D market that was a huge catalyst not only technological advance but also with regard to reimbursement and a number of factors that helped physicians and caregivers. So as we look at technicological events coming up here, I would say, from us early in '26, we do believe that has an impact. But largely, I think the chip shortage rebound is playing a bigger impact on the slower year this year with the breast business. So I still would say it's both, but if I had to lean one way or another, I would tell you that it's a bigger impact on the market. And I'll probably start with the M&A and then kick it to Karleen. And I would say our capital allocation strategy is M&A first. And obviously, anything we can do to help the bottom line if needed we have the luxury of being able to do both. I think if you look at our most recent acquisitions of Endomagnetics and Gynesonics that's the right in the wheelhouse of what we would like to continue to do. Nice size, on-market products that we can grow at a top line at an accretive rate to our core growth rate is exactly the place we'd like to be. Karleen Oberton : And just to build off of that, when we look at financial metrics, it clearly starts with the revenue, we were looking at assets that are accretive to the growth rate. We're looking at things that hopefully have a gross margin that is at the corporate average or may be accretive. And like we've seen with Gynesonics, sometimes they're going to be dilutive on the bottom line, but I think we've got the flexibility to manage that. And then I think over the longer term, we look for a double digit ROIC within a reasonable time frame in terms of return on that investment. So -- and I think if you look at both Endomagnetics and Gynesonics, they played nicely within that framework. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Steve, a couple of guidance related questions here. One on Breast, I think Breast Health guidance here, is the organic for the segment assuming down mid-singles? Steve, I thought I heard you say the year-on-year decline includes the acquisitions. So I guess the organic implied is down mid-single. Is that right? And I guess looking at Q1, why wouldn't trends improve from Q1? Karleen Oberton : So you are right that the organic would be closer to a mid digit decline year-over-year. And I think as we think about sequentially Q1 to Q2, we're looking at similar performance, Q1 to Q2 in terms of absolute dollars. I think we're looking for improvement into Q3 and into Q4. and I think we specifically said Q4 would have a nice growth rate as we exited the year. Vijay Kumar : And Karleen, maybe the follow-up on a similar question on the surgical franchise. I think the high singles includes Gynesonics, so excluding the [indiscernible] point to low singles growth. I guess Q1 was impacted by flu shortage, right? Shouldn't that go away and numbers improve if Gyn was up low singles, shouldn't that be mid to high singles in the back half? Karleen Oberton : So what I would say is as we did see the impact of the IV fluid shortage in Q1 result as we exit the quarter, as we think about Q2, think about Q2 as always a step back from Q1, given the reset of deductibles. And then we'll have improving growth rates in the back half of the year and certainly as we add Gynesonics into that equation. But I think we've provided the guidance on with Gynesonics for what we expect for growth. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Tycho Peterson : Steve, just curious, given your exposure across the portfolio to screening, Breast, Diagnostic, Skeletal, just thoughts on USPSTF given the Braidwood case. What should we be thinking about here, what have you kind of factored in as you think about guidance for the year? Steve MacMillan : We don't expect a big impact from that. At the end of the day, we feel really good about the products that we're providing are meaningful for both patients and frankly, ones that ensures we'll want to continue to take care of. So I think with all the stuff we have going on we're not worried about that and feel very good about where we'll be. Tycho Peterson : And then a follow-up on just Panther utilization. I guess how should we be thinking about utilization growth in the next, call it, five years? Can you kind of double utilization while holding the installed base flat? And what should we be thinking about for the next leg of growth beyond STIs, which have been putting up great growth, but how do we think about kind of further menu expansion? Steve MacMillan : I think the part that we feel great about, both for Panthers is whether it would double on the existing base that might be a little aggressive but there's significant opportunity without needing to place them, which is a capital placement. And similarly, frankly, our capacity to manufacture because of all the expansions we did during COVID, our need for CapEx and things like that are very low. So on the margin, the ability to expand as we bring more menu. And really that menu is going to largely be as we expand the Panther Fusion sidecar. And I think Fusion is not getting as much attention probably as it deserves because that really opens up the dramatic opportunity for our PCR assays, which are cheaper to produce or cheaper to bring to market faster and things like our GI and other things that will be coming down the road will be on that. So the magic is we've got this incredible installed base that we really can't build on through both Fusion and the additional menu. So I think we've got multiple, multiple years of opportunities ahead of us here. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Casey Woodring with JP Morgan. Casey Woodring : So on Breast, can you break out performance in the quarter between US and international customers? You mentioned the international opportunity as a growth driver in the past. But today, you kind of talked about some budget constraints from customers abroad. So wondering how much of an impact you're seeing from that dynamic and the visibility into that improving over the course of the year? And then I have one follow-up. Karleen Oberton : So we look at the performance of the Breast business. We had declines both in the US and international, both were in the mid-single digits, probably a little higher decline internationally. Steve MacMillan : I think it's the same issue of just a much slower market right now. Casey Woodring : And then at our conference, you mentioned that part of the reason you're launching the new gantry in 2026 instead of earlier is that you're consolidating manufacturing to one facility in Breast. Just curious on timing there and the potential margin benefit once the consolidation is finished and the next gantry is launched and ramped? Karleen Oberton : So I think we're on track with the facility with the consolidation. So expect that the facility will not be a hold up as we get into '26. I think in terms of margin, while we will have benefit from consolidation of the facility and probably a little higher ASP on the new gantry, we do have actually higher costs. If you think about one of the components of that new gantry is that for the [arm] to move forward. So I wouldn't expect a change in the margin profile, I think they all kind of net out at the end of the day. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Tejas Savant : Just a couple of cleanups on the gantry side of things, Steve. So I know you've talked about an upgrade pathway on existing gantry sales. Can you just provide some context and the degree to which that that's unlocking some conversations for you or is it really not sort of making much of a dent pending the new gantry launch? And then given the leadership and then compensation sort of adjustments that you've made on Breast Health performance, how should we think about the lessons we learned here here? I mean, obviously, you talked about perhaps assuming a greater quantum of growth. But beyond that, operationally, are there any other lessons that you will take away from the lowering of the growth forecast here of the gantry side of things? Steve MacMillan : I think the discussions for Envision, I think, from a leading customers, there's a lot of excitement. So I think we feel great about -- we have been the innovators in this space, we've been the pioneers, we've been on the leading edge, continue to feel very good about being in that continued position. I think we did -- we probably just got a little overeager about the market growth rates and didn't look back hard enough to realize what we actually had was a bolus in '23 and beginning of '24 as opposed to a long term trend. We were way above that long term trend, more gantries were placed in those quarters than are typical. And I think we had some questions I remember Karleen actually challenging the team a little bit. I think we were just a little too optimistic in that division of thinking about it. And I probably didn't go as deep as I should have in completely challenging the underlying assumption of the market growth rate. So it's a quick lesson learned, a little bit of a misstep there and we're right back on track. And yes, I will tell you, I feel really, really good about the new leadership that Essex has put into that business, a new division President, a new Head of Sales. And I think a deeper level of rigor, analytics and fire than what we had probably coming out of the chip shortage. Tejas Savant : And then maybe one for you, Karleen. Just to clean up on the tariff side of things, I appreciate the color on Mexico as it relates to Gynesonics and Skeletal. But at a high level, given the shifting headlines from one day to the next, how much of Hologic's OUS revenue is made in the US and how much of US revenue was dependent on manufacturing overseas at the portfolio level? Obviously, you've talked about Canada and Mexico exposure as being pretty minimal. You don't sell much in China. So just any color at the portfolio level would be great. Karleen Oberton : Our biggest exposure would be related to our manufacturing in Costa Rica. We manufacture all of our surgical products, except for Gynesonics in Costa Rica and substantially all of our disposal Breast Health products in Costa Rica. So if there was a tariff imposed there that would be the most significant challenge to us. I think the tariffs have been talked about, right now Mexico is the one that would -- it was enacted would impact us but not terribly significantly, but we did want to call it out. Steve MacMillan : And overall, I think we're in a really good position in some days and that effectively all of our gantries and most of our molecular diagnostics are all made in the United States. So resisted a lot of those moves to go overseas through the years and I think that's going to benefit us here well for the next few years at least. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : Two for me. One on Breast and I know you've talked a lot about it this evening. But as we think about 2026 when you do launch the new gantry, arguably, that would carry a price increase with it. And given where we're assuming kind of growth is today, are you suggesting or implied in that would be a decline in units just in terms of unit volume, which is offset by potential price increase? And just taking in the context of Essex's comments that you're selling 3D to 3D now going forward? Steve MacMillan : I think what you'll start to see in '26 is units will start to improve again as the new launch and we will have a combination of both units as well as additional price from a mix standpoint. So it's why we feel really good about where we're going to head. We're not going to guide to '26 at this stage. But it's very nice to be sitting where we're sitting, feeling like we've got line of sight and we know a couple of down quarters here and then we come roaring back. Ryan Zimmerman : And then on Gynesonics, I heard you guys call out. I think I heard and correct me if I'm wrong, Karleen or Essex, $28 million in sales, you're guiding to 25 incrementally for this year. I just want to understand, I think that was $28 million on [indiscernible] basis. The $25 million is that three quarters worth of sales or is there some disruption assumed there? I just want to be clear? Karleen Oberton : The prepared remarks was $25 million for the balance of the year, which is the three quarters. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Karleen, I had a couple of guidance related questions for you. The first one is you talked about some of the policy uncertainty as it relates to the HIV testing. I just wanted to clarify, did you build in -- you talked about disruption up to $30 million of sales. Is that in the guidance or did you put in a risk adjusted number in the guidance or just how did you handle that? Karleen Oberton : It's just it's in the -- substantially in the guidance [Multiple Speakers] even there has been a waiver there is clearly disruption on the ground. And so they could impact the supply chain significantly. So that's why we decided to include it. Jack Meehan : And just to make sure I understand from a reporting perspective, this would show up in the molecular line for the virology testing or is it something else? Karleen Oberton : Virology and molecular, yes, that's correct. Jack Meehan : And then just was wondering if -- I heard the commentary around for the year and it sounds like there's a little bit of a second half step up. Just any color around where we should be landing in 2Q for gross margins and op margins would be helpful? Karleen Oberton : I would say op margins for Q2, you might have a little sequential improvement. But clearly, more improvement in the back half as we see improvement in revenue as well as we talked about Q1 and even Q2 to some extent are our largest operating expense quarters, really Q1 with some of our larger commercial meetings and then some of the variable comp structure is weighted to expense in the first two quarters versus the last two quarters. Operator : We'll take our next question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Puneet Souda : If you don't mind, I want to go back to Breast again. It appears to me, obviously, three issues here. There's the assessment of the forecast, you also had some changes in the incentive comp and sales reps and then there's the market issue with the hospital CapEx. I mean, if I look at the sales side, can you elaborate a little bit on the incentive comp changes and the sales rep changes in the field? And then on the hospital side, if the CapEx pressures that are on today, if they were to get worse, how would it -- how can a hospital continue to purchase sort of new equipment if they have to stress their dollars longer? Just thinking about the sort of the pressures that the hospitals are seeing and then maybe potential pressures that could arise from those or other efforts focusing on the hospitals? Steve MacMillan : I think as we think about the hospital CapEx to come at that, I think we still feel good, right? And again, I can always go back on the '08, '09 downturn where we saw the incredible pressures. Given where mammography sits, which is a few hundred thousand dollars a unit and how critically important women's health and mammography screenings are for hospitals, I think we feel really good that those markets are going to continue to be fine and be there. And then from -- it's back to overall standpoint, the market a little down. Our sales force evolution is one of these things, we go through it from time to time in each of our businesses and we're shifting a little bit more to get -- making sure we're really driving those gantry sales going forward. I think we took our foot off -- our eye off the ball a little bit during the chip shortage because candidly we couldn't deliver. And so now still getting back to that focus on delivering the gantries. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Andrew Cooper : A lot to ask, but maybe just one on kind of the pace of Panther Fusion adoption. Is there any reason that 40% has a cap and can't get to 100 down the road? How do you think about kind of the uptick there as existing customers look to potentially layer in that additional menu? And what does it take from a new menu build out perspective to maybe push some of those folks who haven't done it yet to start looking at a Fusion? Steve MacMillan : I think we feel really good that ultimately, it probably could get close to 100. And it's just kind of a steady improvement as we just win customers one at a time. The molecular diagnostics business, I think some people don't always understand how much effort it takes to change over a customer from one assay to another. And I think what we feel great about is as the lab techs are using Panthers, they just want to keep adding more. And then it's, okay, we'll add a Fusion, we'll qualify a new assay. And so we keep bringing these things out, it's really kind of multiple years of growth ahead as opposed to any one yea of massive step up. So I think that's what gives us the underlying confidence that it just grows over time. Andrew Cooper : And if I can sneak one more in, just on the margins, just want to make sure I understand the guide. If we go past quarter, it was near 30% in 1Q, climbing 50 to 100 basis points. The language was just a little different this quarter in terms of that low 30s for the year and getting better each quarter. Is the exit rate fairly similar, how do we think kind of the landing spot as we move through the course of the year, knowing that the slightly lower revenue is certainly a drag on top of maybe some dilution from the M&A? Karleen Oberton : We'll certainly exit the year at a higher operating margin than where we're at here in Q1 and Q2. But I would just caution that, that's not really -- you're jumping off point for '26. Again, we have some seasonality to our operating expenses as well as highest operating expenses in Q1 and actually typically lowest revenue in Q2. So we will see that improvement that would not be a jumping off point for '26. Steve MacMillan : I think as a reminder, we always do see our operating margin improves over the course of the year, as Karleen said, because the way our expenses flow. And then too often, I think people look at the fourth quarter rate as a, launching off point. We think about it as each quarter year-over-year, so first quarter relative to last first quarter, you look at we just had 80 basis points of gross margin improvement in the current quarter, 90 points of op margin improvement in Q1. We just keep thinking about that -- those rates as opposed to -- and then ultimately, averaging it over the course of the year but feeling that we'll post better margins this year than last year, and they were already pretty good last year. So thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",
