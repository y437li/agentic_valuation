This call is being carried live on the internet and there is a presentation available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference call Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to Carrier's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With me here today are Dave Gitlin, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Except as otherwise noted, the company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a nonrecurring and/or nonoperational nature often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Carrier's registration statement on Form-10 and our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. This morning, we'll review our financial results for the first quarter of 2020, share what the remainder of 2020 could look like under a few scenarios, and we'll leave time for questions at the end. Once the call is opened up for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue, if time permits. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Dave Gitlin. Dave Gitlin : Okay. Thank you, Sam and good morning, everyone. I hope that you and your families are all healthy and safe. Our thoughts go out to everyone affected by this crisis and our thanks go to the frontline workers who are fighting this pandemic. I would also like to recognize the incredible efforts of our entire team at Carrier, which has continued to deliver essential products and services to our customers during these challenging times. I have been so impressed with our 53,000 employees, they have stepped up in a truly profound way and I couldn't be more proud of this phenomenal team. Clearly, a lot has changed since we last spoke to you in February. Therefore, we are going to structure our comments as follows. First, I'll take you through the impact that COVID-19 is having on our business and how we are addressing these dynamics head on. Tim will then run you through our first quarter financials, as well as provide more detail on our approach to managing our liquidity, cash and balance sheet. And then I\u2019ll provide more color on the remainder of 2020. Starting with Slide 2, in response to COVID-19, we jumped into gear early and aggressively. We started daily leadership team meetings that continue today and we established four priorities that have guided our decision making. Our first priority is the safety of our employees. Our office employees are generally working remotely while our factory personnel have largely continued in the workplace to support our customers, given the critical nature of our products and services. In our factories, we have gone to tremendous lengths to keep our people safe by implementing an extensive range of safety protocols, and we are now applying those best practices to our offices as we begin to transition office employees back to the workplace. Our second priority has been to maintain business continuity to deliver essential products and services to our customers. Like other manufacturers, we did experience temporary closures in some of our 49 factories. In China where we have nine factories and about 1,300 suppliers, all of our sites were operational within a couple of weeks after the February 10, reopening after the Lunar New Year. And our output from our sites and from our local suppliers has been close to 100% for the past month. We have had short-term factory closures in India, Malaysia, Mexico, the EU, and the U.S., but our team has done a superb job of minimizing the length of the occasional site closures and supporting our customers. While we continue to experience episodic supplier challenges, our supply chain team has been managing these issues as they arise. Our third priority is to effectively manage our costs and preserve cash. Tim will cover this topic in more detail, but I'm pleased with our proactive approach and early results. We accelerated and increased savings through Carrier 600, which is our plan to eliminate $600 million in costs over three years. Between our overdrive expectations on Carrier 600 for this year, together with other onetime cost actions, we will be driving $425 million in cost actions this year. For example, we have implemented a 15% pay cut for our senior leadership team, including myself, reduced the Board of Director pay, instituted a 15 day furlough, suspended merit increases. We're driving down expected incremental public company costs by about $25 million for the year, and we are aggressively managing our discretionary spend. We will also be reducing our CapEx from our initial plan of $350 million to $400 million to $200 million to $225 million. Though, we are aggressively containing spend, we continue to invest in areas that are critical to our growth agenda including R&D, sales and digital, all critical to our core strategy to get to sustain mid-single digit growth levels. On the cash side, we are comfortable with our liquidity position. We started with $1.3 billion in cash on April 3, and we are confident in our ability to generate more than a $1 billion in free cash flow this year. We have access to a $2 billion revolver if needed, so we have a strong cash position and are carefully managing it. Finally, our fourth priority has been to ensure that we emerge from this pandemic stronger, by accelerating implementation of our strategic imperatives. And I'll give you more color on that on the next slide. So turning to Slide 3, it highlights how we're positioning Carrier for long-term success. Starting with our organization culture, focus and values, this truly is a new Carrier with a very different feel to it both internally and externally. We\u2019ve recently launched the Carrier Way, which lays out our vision, values and behaviors. Our culture is focused on customers, winning, growth, agility, innovation and empowerment. We are breaking down barriers to enable our people to be more externally focused, and empowering them to drive our long-term growth agenda. On people, we have made great progress in assembling a world-class leadership team with both external hires and promotions of internal talent. We launched the new Carrier operating system, which is both nimble and discipline. And we are doubling down on our ESG commitments with a laser focus on our commitment to the environment, through not only our own factories, but also more innovative energy efficient products. And we've supplemented our focus on the environment with initiatives that support the needs of our communities by playing our part in the fight against this pandemic. For example, we designed and produced our new optically negative air machine in just a few weeks. And early feedback from the hospitals on our prototype units is very positive. Turning to our strategy and growth pillars, these remain unchanged. We continue to deliver against our three strategic top line priorities funded by Carrier 600. In the first pillar, growing our core, we remain well-positioned within each of our segments building off of our number one or two market positions. We are also adding 500 net sales employees while we continue to make key strategic R&D and digital investments. We've had significant wins across the portfolio including our largest order ever of 19DV chillers for data centers in Indonesia, and exclusive long-term resi deal with Fischer Homes in the U.S. and very significant wins across our refrigeration and F&S portfolios. In our second pillar, extending our products and geographic coverage. As a vote of confidence in our CO2 technology that we're using to enter warehouse refrigeration, we were selected to provide the cooling for the Beijing Olympics ice rink. And we secured a VRF win for the Sanyo [ph] Olympic Village Apartments in China, for 3,500 heat pumps and 1,000 condensing units. And in the third pillar, driving aftermarket and digital, we have a dedicated aftermarket team in place. We indicated that we'd get to a 30% conversion rate in commercial HVAC by the end of next year, and we are on track to do so this year. We're rolling out structured tiered offerings customized to customers' needs, and we have leaned forward on digital as a differentiator through remote monitoring, diagnostics and prognostics. We've had some key aftermarket wins, including a four year chiller service agreement with the Hong Kong International Airport for 52 chillers across 17 buildings, and support for Tim Hortons China operations that is projected to scale to 1,500 stores over the next 10 years. And on the right side of this slide, we're very proud of our essential and vital role in society. We support air conditioning systems in hospitals and nursing homes, and the delivery of food and pharmaceuticals safely around the world. Looking ahead, as countries and regions around the world are preparing to reopen economies and society, we intend to play a critical role in anticipating and creating the new normal. For example, indoor air quality will be critical. We're putting the VVAC and HVAC in our unique electrostatic systems can filter microscopic size contaminants. Carrier will be a leader in transitioning buildings around the world, from sick to healthy buildings. Addressing food safety and the new normal will be paramount, and we have been making tremendous progress on holistic whole chain solutions. And then our fire and security business, touchless and traceability will be very thematic in the future. With our touchless Blue Diamond solution, we can eliminate 80% of typical contact points in an office building, by enabling employees to use their cell phones instead. So with that, let me turn it over to Tim to discuss 1Q, cost and cash and I'll come back to discuss our best sense of 2020. Tim? Tim McLevish : Thank you, Dave. Good morning. Please turn to Slide 4, where I will walk you through our Q1 results. But before I start, I want to point out that as we move from being a division of United Technologies, to becoming a fully independent public company, some of the numbers we report will not have a perfect comparison with last year's. The Form-10 carve out statements adjusted for that in some circumstances, but not all. We will try to help you understand those non-comparables with explanations, but it may be a bit messy and will continue to be so for the remainder of the year. With that caveat, let me jump into the results for our first quarter. Despite significant macroeconomic headwinds in the back-half of the quarter, it started out about how we had expected and reflected a solid start to the year. Sales of $3.9 billion were down 10% from last year, 9% organically, which adjusts for a 1% FX headwind. We reported an Investor Day that we face difficult year-on-year comparisons in each of our three segments. In HVAC, our residential results last year reflected a strong furnace season due to abnormally high shipments ahead of a new FER regulation. In refrigeration, our North America truck and trailer business came off a cyclical peak in Q1 last year. And in F&S, we wound down our residential intrusion business, creating a year-on-year decline in 2020. Additional pressure came from the warm winter this year and resulting softness in residential furnace sales. These items accounted for about half of our Q1 decline. The remainder resulted from the impact of COVID-19 on our business in the latter part of the quarter. It first hit China, where about 8% or $1.5 billion of our revenues are derived. This had a material detrimental effect with domestic China's sales down approximately 40%. And in addition, a good part of our global factory production and supply chain sources come from China. We did however, managed through that disruption without a material impact on our rest of world business. But then, later in the quarter, the virus moved west into Europe and then on to the Americas. This pandemic accounted for about $230 million of our revenue decline in the quarter. Our teams have worked tirelessly to keep factories operational and productive to serve our customers around the world. And they continue to do so. Moving down the P&L, GAAP operating profit was $315 million. Adjusted operating profit of $436 million was down 16% from last year. But this adjusted number is still not comparable. Our Q1 included about $24 million of public company costs that were not included in the same quarter of 2019. Absent the impact of that, the comparable year-on-year decline was 12%. And of course, it was heavily impacted by COVID-19. While we're not happy about the negative signs here, a 12% decline for comparable adjusted operating profits, versus a 9% decline in organic revenues, shows we were able to offset a lot of the typical detrimentals, largely preserving our operating margin. Our Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.11 and adjusted EPS was $0.35. Since we were not a public company last year, the year-over-year comparisons of EPS are not meaningful. I'm pleased to report that our free cash flow was favorable to last year by over $200 million. Q1 is typically a seasonal user of cash, so bring it in almost flat reflected a solid start to the year. The decline in net income was more than offset by favorable working capital results and aided by some deferred tax payments. All things considered, our performance in the first quarter was solid with good mitigation of a very difficult environment. Let's now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide five. HVAC was done 9% organically. Within it North America residential was down 11% organically, with roughly half the decline due to last year's FER driven accelerated gas furnace shipments, and the other half to slow shipments this year due to the unseasonably warm winter. Overall furnace sales were down 30% year-over-year. The commercial business was down 8% organically, as a 5% decline in light commercial and 20% decline in applied, driven by weakness in China and Europe, that was only partially offset by a flattish services business and strengthen ALC and NORESCO. Refrigeration sales were down 14% organically, with North America truck trailer down close to 30%, Europe truck trailer down around 15%, and container down around 7%. A difficult truck trailer comparison for the quarter was expected, as I mentioned earlier, but the results did deteriorate as the quarter progressed. Commercial refrigeration was down 13% organically, with weakness in both Europe and Asia. The fire and security segment was down 5% organically, with the products business down 4% organically. This was attributable to COVID-related projects delays and shutdowns in Asia and Europe, but was partially offset by growth in our longer cycle businesses, water mist and gas suppression, and also growth in global access solutions. The field business was down 5% organically, due to markets lockdowns across regions, with particular weakness in Hong-Kong, Australasia and France. In this world of uncertainty, we're focused on controlling the controllables, and that includes aggressive cost containment actions. Slide 6, provides a breakdown of our cost programs. In February, we told you that we expected to achieve $175 million of savings from our Carrier 600 this year, and that we would invest $150 million of that back into the business to support our growth strategies. The current environment shift is one of our priorities, to aggressively reduce cost yet to preserve critical investment initiatives. The actions that we're taking are expected to generate $425 million of cost improvement this year, including accelerating Carrier 600, reducing our planned investments and implementing in aggressive cost containment program. First, we will accelerate Carrier 600 and expect to deliver an additional $50 million in 2020, for a total of $225 million. Second, we have scaled back our investments in the year by $75 million in a very surgical manner. We are preserving the investments and initiatives that are most critical to our growth strategy to ensure we are well-positioned as we exit this crisis. We have also initiated a $300 million cost containment program for 2020. Lastly, while COVID-19 affected volume and the drop through of margins, it also disrupts our factories and other areas of our cost base. We're anticipating a $200 million of nonrecurring headwind this year on things like factory absorption, supply chain disruption, expediting costs, and inefficiencies caused by precautions for the safety of our employees. The $425 million of cost actions more than offsets this impact, and our net savings are $250 million, up from the $25 million we laid out at Investor Day in February. Dave mentioned our top priorities for 2020, one of which is to maintain ample liquidity. Please turn to Slide 7 and I'll walk you through that. I mentioned earlier that we've performed well from a cash flow standpoint in a quarter that is typically a big user of cash. Our working capital usually seasonally spikes in Q1, as we start building for the spring-summer selling season. We managed it tightly this year and delivered better cash than planned by over $200 million. We started the quarter with a cash position of $952 million and ended it with a balance of $768 million. This resulted from a neutral free cash flow and the use of $184 million from other investing and financing activities, including a small debt repayment, and the effective foreign exchange. And at spin, UTC returned us approximately $560 million of cash. So our opening balance sheet started with just over $1.3 billion on April 3. From this base, we will continue our efforts to preserve and enhance our liquidity. We'll intensify our focus on all the components and levers available to us. This will include tightly managing working capital, expanding and driving the program we began in Q1. We've also done a deep scrub of our CapEx budget for the year and cut it by 40% to 50%. It is now $200 million to $225 million down from the $350 million to $400 million, we had originally planned. And paring it back, we have prioritized those projects targeted our strategic priorities for growth, and those projects which have high-returns and a quick payback. We will also assess the timing and amount of a dividend. Our Form-10 identified a possible dividend scenario that was appropriate at the time, but the environment we face today is much different from what it was then. With this foundation, and these actions, we expect good free cash flow for the year and it will add to our available cash. In addition to our cash position, we have a $2 billion revolving credit agreement with a strong Bank Group. That revolver remains undrawn and fully available to us. And finally, I will remind you that we have no debt maturities until 2023. So we feel quite good about our liquidity and are confident we have access to the capital we need to weather this storm and to operate and grow the business. With that, let me turn it back over to Dave to discuss how we're thinking about the balance of the year. Dave Gitlin : Thanks, Tim. So what does this mean for our expectations for the full year? For our scenario planning in this uncertain global economy, we looked at three key indicators to frame our thinking. First, macroeconomic projections like GDP. Second, indicators more directly tied to our business like new housing starts. And third order trends. At a macro level, starting with GDP, our current guidepost for 2020 assume U.S. GDP declines about 25% in the second quarter, and 5% to 10% for the full year. Expectations for Europe are similar. We assume China shows growth in Q2 and accelerates from there. When we look at macro indicators specific to our segments, we assume headwinds from lower replacement volumes as unemployment rates impact home owner purchases. U.S. Housing starts being down 10% to 20% this year and continued softness in non-resi construction starts in North America and Europe, as we see from leading indicators like the architectural billing index. And in our refrigeration business, the forecast declines in North America and Europe truck trailer will be even steeper than we had originally forecasted. ACT forecast North American truck trailer production to be down 45% this year, and European truck trailer is likely to be down 20% to 30%. Container drops are likely to be far more muted. So then on Page 8, let me share some color with you on orders. We start with our China experience. Q1 orders were down 40% year-over-year with February being the lowest month down 50%. In the category of good news, the China recovery has been very positive. Our daily order rates returned to pre-crisis levels in mid-April, and our April orders in China were flat overall. The recovery has been a bit spotty and one month doesn't make a trend, but for us, China's decline and then its recovery were both quite steep. Our current thinking about the U.S. and EU is that the decline will be a bit shallower, but the recovery will be longer. For us, orders declined earlier in the EU than in the U.S. but we also expect an early recovery. Orders in 1Q were down 10% in Europe, but were down 5% in the U.S., and that accelerated into April with Europe down 30% and the U.S. down 25%. Based on a slower recovery in the EU and U.S. versus China, our internal planning assumes recovery of orders to more typical levels as we get into later 3Q and early Q4. So what does this all mean as we frame 2020, turning to Slide 9. You could think of the numbers that you see here as guideposts, as we look at various scenarios playing out globally. We see sales between $15 billion to $17 billion, adjusted our profit between $1.7 billion and $2 billion and free cash flow over $1 billion. Also, with respect to the scenarios behind the sales decline for the whole company, you should think about the HVAC segment declined fairly aligned with the percentage range that you see here, with refrigeration facing a bit more headwind and F&S expected to be a bit at the better end of the range. Given that 80% of our sales are in the U.S. and Europe, we expect the steepest declines to occur in 2Q with improvements from there. So, we\u2019ve done our best to analyze the rest of the year for ourselves and for you, and we will continue to update you as this very fluid situation evolves. And though the coming months are inherently uncertain, what I do know with great confidence is that we'll get through this crisis. And over the long-term mega trends such as climate change, global urbanization, and the shift towards digitalization and operating in the new normal will remain tailwinds for our business. And this takes me to our last page, on Page 10. We remain confident, that the game plan that we laid out for you on February 10 will drive the results that you see here. We are getting real traction on the three pillars of our topline strategy which will propel sustained mid-single digit topline growth. We are tenaciously driving Carrier 600 to invest in growth and to help drive margin expansion to enable high-single digit EPS growth on a steady state basis. And we are laser focused on driving working capital improvements needed to support free cash flow equal to net income. We have a clear roadmap to success. We remain committed to executing on our plan with urgency, conviction, and effectiveness. And with that we'll open this up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hey, good morning. Dave Gitlin : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Just on kind of the bridge a bit, thanks for the color on kind of the guideposts. Any color on price cost and what you expect to run through what you're seeing out there for the year? Dave Gitlin : Yes. On the price side, Steve, we're still looking at overall price tailwind, but it's going to be minor. It's going to be in the range of $4 million. We actually sell $4 million in the first quarter, it's probably $20 million for the full year. Keep in mind, we're coming off a couple of years of a lot of price tailwind. It was north of $200 million in 2018. It was closer to $175 million last year. But we do think there's going to be a little bit more price challenges in the overall system, but we're still looking at some net tailwind from price. And then Tim took you through the cost side. We're going to be very aggressive. You saw that we upped our Carrier 600 for this year from $175 million to $225 million. We're being very aggressive, especially on the supply chain side where we got some tailwind from commodity pricing, but a lot of aggressiveness on the negotiations and resourcing activity. And we're also certainly seeing a lot of headwind in factory productivity. But we are really going after G&A in this climate. Steve Tusa : Right. And then just lastly on the balance sheet, a little bit better cash. I think that's an incremental positive. But you're still going to end with some pretty high-leverage. And I think there's a covenant out there that you guys have. Can you just talk about what that covenant is? And how much of a hard line it may be? Like, how concerned should we be about that? And any actions you're willing to take in the intermediate-term other than just generating cash to shore up the balance sheet? Tim McLevish : Yes. This is Tim, Steve. So, yes. We do have a covenant that covers both our revolving credit agreement and our term loan. And I think it's attached to the Form-10. You can see that it says that it's first measured in our third quarter, at the end of our third quarter. And the covenant is four times debt to EBITDA. According to the projections that you see in our scenario planning, we do anticipate that we will be in compliance with a covenant at that point. And we're expecting that it only gets better from there. We have some cushions, so we're not unduly concerned about that. But obviously, we want to ensure that we have liquidity. And you can assume that we're taking actions to ensure that we have access to that. Steve Tusa : Okay. And what if you do breach it ultimately, in the next several quarters? You're wrong in your projections? Tim McLevish : No. Let's just say we're going to make sure that we don't. I mean, obviously it would preclude us from access to revolving credit agreements. And it would put our term loan in some -- and I guess in default. But we will assure that we're not going to run into that problem. We've already in this transaction. You can be sure that we've already taken precautions. We're not going to put ourselves in jeopardy. Dave Gitlin : Yes. Steve, it\u2019d Dave. First of all, its net debt that 4x multiple. And also like Tim said, behind the scenes we are working it. So I think we're in pretty good shape, we're managing it quite well. Tim McLevish : Yes. I would point out further to what Dave just said. Its net debt and as an EBITDA as adjusted, there are some carve outs exceptions to it. So again, we're comfortably in compliance with it. But again, we want to make sure. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. Thanks. Dave Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Dave Gitlin : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Yes. So, nothing surprise that we're seeing CapEx getting cut in this environment and some of the investment spending is pushing to the right. Can you maybe just talk about where you are down back a little bit on the investment spending and the CapEx? And whether we should think of this as a more of a push as opposed to a shove [ph]? Dave Gitlin : Yes. I would say Nigel, it's probably more of a push. We did scale back on investments like automation. We're really focused on keeping the shops running. So to have industrial engineers in the shop, figuring out how to implement automation is not ideal timing, so we did push some of our automation spend. We are doing ERP consolidation. We pushed that to the right. So a lot of the discretionary actions like that that don't necessarily affect growth, we have pushed out. We've been pretty tenacious at preserving investments that affect our growth agenda. So our view is that, like an outfielder, it's easier to run forward than backward. We came out, we were aggressive, we saw what was happening, we've made the right cuts to the budget. We'll see how the year progresses. If things open up a little bit, we'll pull some of the investments we pushed out into next year, we'll pull back into this year. But we've really gone to great lengths to preserve investments that have the highest payback that are going to protect our growth agenda. Nigel Coe : Right. Thanks, David. And then you gave a number for housing stuff in the U.S. down 10% to 20%. And then you've talked about replacement demands being down. I struggled to think about how to think about replacements in this environment given where unemployment is? What's your view right now on resi replacement? Dave Gitlin : Yes. Look, it's probably down in the 15% range or so, as we look at it. There were 3.8 million Americans last month that did not pay their mortgages. So, it's going to be a tough climate for at least a while. But where there's demand, there's demand. And there may be a little bit of movement to a little bit more parts by for the next few months to replacement. We haven't actually seen that just yet. But we do think there's going to be a little bit of headwind on the replacement cycle. But, we'll see as we get into the summer months, if employment, of course, the numbers remain extremely challenging right now. But as folks come back to work and society starts to reopen, we'll hopefully start to see a little bit more traction there. Nigel Coe : And then just a quick one on free cash flow. Is that all in free cash? Or is it some kind of concept of adjusted free cash flow? Is that including one timers? Tim McLevish : No, the free cash flow is -- I mean, it's free cash flow, traditionally its operating cash flow, GAAP operating cash flow plus capital expenditures or less capital expenditures. Nigel Coe : So, it's real cash. Great. Thanks guys. Dave Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thanks. Good morning. I hope everyone's well. Just a couple, first, just on the on the CapEx push Dave. So, it does sound like you're not doing any good damage to the growth plans. But I would think this also then pushes out some of your underlying productivity plans right? So, you're taking temporary actions to contain costs but automation and ERP was a big part of future productivity. Can you just elaborate kind of on the interplay between those factors? Dave Gitlin : Yes. Jeff, when you look at productivity, it was a key element and it is a key element of Carrier 600. But I will tell you that only a piece of that is automation. There's another piece that just comes from really application, the carrier operating system. So, it will have a short-term impact. I actually think what you're going to see with the new normal, is you're going to see people leaning more forward on automation as you get out into the end of this year and into future years. So look, we're going to free up the investments on automation as we get towards the end of this year into next year, because I think it's going to be really critical to our overall story. We hadn't really baked ERP consolidations into our overall cost savings numbers. So, I don't see that impacting Carrier 600. It impacts overall productivity and some of the manual nature of what we do. But we'll have to catch up to those investments next year. Jeff Sprague : And perhaps it's early to talk about a different number. But with this kind of acceleration is Carrier 600 on the path to be in $700 million and $750 million something like that? Dave Gitlin : Well, it is early. A couple of months doesn't make a trend. But look, I'm confident, I've always been confident in the Carrier 600 number, and I think there's room to overdrive it. But we'll see how the rest of the year plays out and we'll update that as we get out to the end of this year. Jeff Sprague : And then just finally. So then on the dividend, we should expect that's kind of on hold until you get pass this Q3 covenant, make sure you're kind of clear the decks there? Tim McLevish : I think that would be directionally fair, Jeff. You recall that back in our Investor Day that we said that we would expect the $550 million dividend, and we thought that was a competitive dividend in a normal circumstance. Obviously, we're not under normal circumstances. And preservation of cash and addressing our high leverage is the high priority right now. And so we're deferring a little bit the decision and the level. I mean, in this environment, we perhaps will or we likely will consider reducing that amount and still be competitive from a yield standpoint, from a payoff standpoint. But yes, you should anticipate to hear something in the near future. But again, it's not likely to be at the same level that we talked about Investor Day. Jeff Sprague : Thanks. It makes sense. Good luck. Dave Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe I'm just trying to stick to the one question rule, perhaps focusing on margins for a second. So, I think at the midpoint of the scenario plan you've got about maybe about 25%, 30% decremental margin dialed-in for the year. Maybe just help us understand, how you see the relative mix within that as transport refrigeration probably one of the businesses that falls the fastest this year in sales terms? And then also related to that, should we expect the decremental margins to be widest in the second quarter? Or you're assuming that decrementals are pretty level over Q2 to Q4? Thank you. Tim McLevish : Yes. Julian, it's Tim. As you know, we usually think of what we call a drop through rate decremental. Usually, I like to think of it as incremental, but unfortunately in this environment, we talked about decrementals. That\u2019s about a 28%. What you saw in the first quarter actually was much favorable to that. But that was largely because we had the better part of 10 percentage points worth of benefit from cost reduction in the quarter, about $40 million lower cost. And that contributed to a much lower drop through. And interestingly, our sales in China were hit during the quarter, the hardest of ours and China tends to carry lower general margins through and we benefited by about 4%. So, that's why you see the 14%. You actually may not see the 14%, you may see a 19%. But remember, we talked about a $24 million standalone cost, that's the first quarter component of the $107 million that you ultimately see for the full year. I will also point out that I think you may have seen from UTC's released yesterday, numbers that are a little bit different. About $20 million difference in profits. So if you adjust for that there's some unusual things where it was different from most of them. You may have construed at a 24% from them. As we think about the rest of the year, again, going back to the 28%. Yes, I would say second quarter is likely to be the hardest hit quarter. And the deeper the drop in revenues, it makes it difficult. We aren't just scaling back production, we're shutting the lines down. We're closing shifts, we're in some cases, closing factories. And you go deeper into the cost pool there and I would expect that to be in the second quarter. We will experience some mix degradation, the reverse of what you saw, I mean, some of our higher margin businesses, the residential, HVAC and others will be hit. How I simply think about rest of year, decrementals though, is that we\u2019ll be hit by two or three points with JV income, because there's no offsetting revenue component to the drop in earnings that we're anticipating. And then all other of the costs, the factory disruption, et cetera, is largely covered that, and the margin mix is covered by our cost reduction. So we anticipate, if you look at the projections we\u2019ll probably be about 30%, couple points worse than the normal 28%. Julian Mitchell : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And let me also say congrats on the debut. I'm not sure anyone was expecting quite as a tough environment, as you've had to face in your debut here. But appreciate all the color and all the actions that you're taking. Dave Gitlin : Thanks Deane. Deane Dray : If we can start, just we've heard the expression this too will pass. Looking ahead, could you expand on the comments or the examples you were giving on how the buildings of the future are going to change? We've heard some similar comments from your competitors, this earnings season about air purification, touchless credentials and so forth. But are these just thoughts? Or are these actually starting discussions with customers? How close are you to marketing and actually getting orders for this type of the new normal buildings? Dave Gitlin : Well, thanks Deane for the question. Actually, it's absolutely underway. We've been in discussions and we've actually seen real progress with customers, whether it's the State of Florida or with hospitals where we've distributed our new OptiClean negative air machines. We're coming out of the gates fast on this one, because we believe it's critical, not only for our business but it's critical for society. There are a shockingly number, high-number of sick buildings out there. And one of the characteristics of a sick building is the ventilation system. You look at the room I'm in right now, you would expect a certain number of air changes per hour, say in the 10 to 15 range. And many buildings around the world have staggered in there and they don't have the number of changes per hour. You look at the filtration system in many buildings as you have the returnee are going through a filtration system, you'd expect it to be able to filter out contaminants at a 0.1-0.3 micron level and many filtration systems don't have that. We have that with our electric static filters for homes, UAV or HEPA filters in commercial buildings. Many buildings don't have that. You want your ducts cleaned every three to five years and that doesn't happen. So as we look at the transition to healthy buildings, I think you should expect that Carrier's going to be front and center on that. And it's very real, and it's the same in our other two segments. You mentioned touchless, in our fire and security business, we already have a Blue Diamond app that can eliminate a lot of the touch points. Let\u2019s say, you go from your car to your office building, there's usually eight to 10 touch points. And like I said in the earlier remarks, we can eliminate 80% of that as you go to open the turnstile or you press the elevator button or you adjusted the HVAC controls in your office or on your floor. There's a number of touch points that we can eliminate that are going to be critical. And it also is combined with the traceability elements. So as employers want to be able in the workplace to trace folks, we have an app that can commingle with the other parts of the app to be able to track people in the workplace. And the other segment that we have in our refrigeration business, the entire cold chain is going to be just foundationally and fundamentally different. So you look at how people get their food today in a place like China. And there's a significant number of wet markets and we have farmer's markets here in the U.S. and in Europe. But you're going to see a lot more home delivery of goods. The cold chain is going to be critical for that and pharmaceuticals. And we're working on some telematics and other what we believe to be quite cutting edge innovative solutions to really connect the entire cold chain. So we think we can play a real pivotal role in the new normal. Deane Dray : I appreciate all that color. And just a quick clarification from Tim if I could, just with regard to capital allocation and cash preservation. The expectation was that Carrier was going to have investment grade rating with your expectation you'd be paying down debt. So what's the outlook in your discussions with the rating agencies? Are they giving you some leeway here, in terms of the path of the deleveraging? Thanks. Tim McLevish : Well, it's still intention to maintain investment grade. We\u2019ve been in conversations with the agencies. As I said, they\u2019ve recognized that short-term liquidity is critically important in this crisis situation with the uncertainty about the economy. We've been in regular discussions with them and I think they are supportive of our game plan. And I think we'll be just fine. Deane Dray : Great to hear. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Melius Research. Your line is open. Carter Copeland : Hey, good morning Dave, Tim. I hope you're well. Dave Gitlin : Thanks Carter. Carter Copeland : Dave, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the portfolio. I mean, these sorts of discontinuities and changes have a tendency to make you think about the business in different ways. And I know that sort of optionality around the long-term, appearance of the businesses is something you thought about, you mentioned tangentially at the Investor Day. I wondered how this whole crisis may be changing that thinking if at all. David Gitlin : Yes. Carter, what I\u2019d tell you is that, what we said at an Investor Day remains consistent today, that our number one priority is on execution. We really feel very strongly that we can unleash tremendous value just by doing what we said we were going to do. As we get sales consistently in mid-single digit range, and we get EPS at the high-single digit rate and we get cash flow about equal to net income, we know that consistent track record or performance will have a significant impact on the overall valuation of Carrier. And then we're playing from a position of strength. So our number one priority is focus on execution. Our number two priority is to really take a very dispassionate look at our current portfolio. And of course, we've been doing that for quite some time. And we said that we would put our current portfolio through a very specific set of criteria. Are we the rightful owner? Does it strategically fit? Does it meet the financial criteria that we've set out for ourselves? And if it doesn't, we'll be dispassionate and do the right thing about divesting those parts of the portfolio. I think once you make that decision, you will of course have to look at the current environment and decide if you're going to do something like that, when would be the right time and this is not the ideal time to do something like that. But we'll look at the right time, if there are parts of the portfolio that we decide don't meet the criteria that we've set. And then in terms of that third category, overall, more strategic types of transactions, that is not our priority right now. We know that our peers have made themselves more pure plays SFV. But our focus right now is on that first category of execution and on the second category of the real portfolio analysis that we've been going through, and we'll deal with that second. Carter Copeland : Okay, great. And, Tim, I wondered just a quick clarification. Thanks for the color on truck trailer. Can you tell us what the container orders look like both at maybe end of the quarter or April trends? Dave Gitlin : Yes. Carter, it's Dave. Container orders have actually been pretty steady. So, we're going to see how things play out. But when we look at overall container orders, and there's been a couple of months where it's been positive, a couple of months where it's been negative. Overall, Q1 was down 7%, I believe. When we got into April, it was positive. So on balance, it's probably flat to down just low-single digits right now. Carter Copeland : Great. Thanks, Dave. Dave Gitlin : Yes. Thank you, Carter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning, guys. Dave Gitlin : Good. Morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : So I understand we've covered a lot of ground here already and I appreciate the color. I guess, in regards to some of the cost actions in Carrier 600, how do we think about operating leverage on the way out? Tim, you talked about the 28% target number. Obviously, a lot of things moving around, some temporary, some pull forward of the total. How should we think about exit rate incrementals being above or below that target number just as some of these temporary costs come back? Tim McLevish : Yes. I would generally \u2013 again, a lot of the recovery from a higher decremental came from the costs actions that we identified as a kind of this year impact. Again, Carrier 600 is kind of separate from that. We took these to offset the higher decrementals with the disruption and so forth. So I would expect that we should be coming out of this as we increment back up at a similar rate 28% give or take 1% or 2%. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just related to that, I guess, supply chain was a part of Carrier 600. Obviously, everyone's taking a harder look at their supply chain today with some of the interruptions. Anything that changes with respect to that are needs to be reshuffled? Tim McLevish : No. When you think about supply chain, we've talked about 55% of these savings will come from supply chain. And we're still on that level. It's going well. Remember, David said, there's probably 6,000 suppliers and we're going to consolidate, probably cut it in half. And as we become more meaningful, we're able to partner better, we get some better pricing, we get some better terms. That's a big, big component of it. And that's tracking very well. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. I appreciate the detail. Best of luck, guys. Dave Gitlin : Thank you. Thanks, Josh. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna : Yes. Thanks for the detail guys, and congrats on the first quarter. I'm curious, when you look at the commercial HVAC and fire and security backlogs, what do you perceive to be kind of at-risk, perhaps serving industries that are going to be very hard hit by the recession? So, whether it's hospitality or what have you. Could you give us some framework on parts of the backlog that might stretch for an extended period, even when you have site access against? Any sort of framework for that? Dave Gitlin : Thanks, Gautam. This is Dave. One piece of good news is that our sequential backlog in the first quarter was up. It was up about 6% in HVAC and about a third of that in resi and two-thirds in commercial HVAC. So the backlog position did improve in the first quarter. We look at, to the extent that there is any shift from left to the right. It\u2019s really -- we think it\u2019s going to be relatively minor. We\u2019re talking a month here and there. We feel that there are some construction sites that once they come back on there\u2019s going to be really some pent up demand. Our experience in China was this, that after folks came back from the Lunar New Year, that was factories were allowed to open February 10. Basically all of our factories, they were generally on line as you got into that February 20, timeframe. We had the backlog and we started to ship the backlog. What followed was a lot of the construction sites that had the migrant workers in China, they were quarantine a little bit longer. And then they started to receive the backlog and then that was followed by new orders sticking up as we got into April. And we think it will be a similar phenomenon as the construction sites come back online in the U.S. and Europe, they'll start to take delivery of the backlog. There may be some push out a month here or there, but frankly, some places like universities or education has been taking this opportunity with folks out to actually accelerate some of the construction. So some is being accelerated, some will naturally get pushed out. But where it gets pushed out, we're talking maybe weeks or a month or two here, it's not going to be significant. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And just a follow-up for Tim. Could you actually disaggregate the $425 million of costs into structural versus variable? I don't know if you said that in the opening remarks. Tim McLevish : Yes. So I\u2019d just go down on the charts to the $425 million. The Carrier 600 and the $50 million incremental will be a structural that will be enduring. The investment, if you recall, we said that our investment this year originally was going to be $150 million. We expected it to scale back to an incremental $100 million next year and then $50 million before we will go back to normal. This $75 million that we pulled out will be pushed in, likely invested next year, so kind of push out that schedule a little bit. And the $300 million is really one time action, that was furloughing, most all of our salaried employees, it was deferring merit, it was cutting back on. Obviously, it wasn't hard to cut back on travel because there wasn't any travel anyway, but it's reducing services, supplies, et cetera. That will likely -- I mean it won't be caught up, but it is not a structural change, it will come back. Gautam Khanna : Thank you very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one final question. Our last question will be from the line of [indiscernible] from Citi Group. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Dave Gitlin : Thanks, Lad. Unidentified Analyst : Can you talk about within the fire and security business, just how much of the overall businesses is driven by regulatory or statutory requirements? And should therefore be more resilient? And can you also talk about in that business what restrictions on building access and social distancing measures could potentially mean for productivity in the field business? Dave Gitlin : Yes, thanks for the question. We look at -- there's a piece of the fire portfolio. You think a fire's a much bigger piece than the security piece. And there is a piece of the fire that's regulatory in nature. We look at the fire and security portfolio in two aspects. There's the products piece and then there's the Chubb [ph]. Products is about 60%, Chubb is about 40%. Within the 40% that's Chubb, you have a monitoring and installation and a services piece. And the services piece is where you do see some regulatory. And that has generally held up during this downturn better than the installation piece, which got hit pretty hard in the March timeframe into April, especially in Europe. On the product side, some of our businesses like Edwards, that's held up quite well, because there is a regulatory piece of that. And we actually saw growth increases in parts of our Edward's business and others that like GST, where we have a regulatory piece in China. Some of the security portfolio is less regulatory in nature. But what's interesting there is we are starting to see a lot more demand for some of our products that are going to be critical in this new normal. So as hotels start to think about how they're going to gear up in the new normal, we're in discussions with a number of them with our Entity [ph] system, where folks can bypass the front desk, go directly to the room and use more touchless type applications. We're seeing that with real estate brokers for our super business. So, even though, it's not regulatory, some parts of the security portfolio could be quite compelling in the new normal. And we're in some pretty interesting discussions as folks -- as some of our key customers gear up for the new normal. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just maybe one last one from me. I know the order information you gave was very helpful. I guess just going forward the U.S. and the EMEA were actually pretty similar in April. So as we go through the year, do you expect the U.S. and EMEA to continue sort of trending in similar directions? Are there differences in the COVID-19 responses and protocols that could push for more divergence amongst those two regions? Dave Gitlin : You know, quite honestly, it's hard to say, because it's even hard to generalize the U.S. and it's hard to generalize Europe. When we look at Europe, Germany has been coming on back online quite well. Recently, we see the automotive manufacturers coming back. We feel good about Germany. Spain and Italy have been coming back online over the last two to three weeks in a fairly positive way. France is more delayed. 80% of the construction sites in France are still not operational. So I think France will be lagging and probably the UK lagging behind Germany and some of the others. And you're probably going to see a bit of a mixed bag in the United States, as different states come online at different times. I think if you were to compare the two, our experience so far over the last few months is that the U.S. has generally been three to four weeks behind Europe, in terms of on the way down and on the way back up. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no additional questions in the queue. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Dave Gitlin : Well, I'd like to thank everyone for taking the time to join us today. Please know that Sam is also ready for your questions. And we appreciate your time and attention this morning. So thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

This call is being carried live on the internet and there is a presentation available to download from Carrier\u2019s website at ir.carrier.com. I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you and good morning and welcome to Carrier\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With me here today are David Gitlin, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim McLevish, Chief Financial Officer. Except as otherwise noted, the company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a nonrecurring and/or nonoperational nature often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier\u2019s SEC filings, including Carrier\u2019s registration statement on Form-10 and the reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. This morning, we\u2019ll review our financial results for the second quarter of 2020, discuss the full year 2020 outlook and we\u2019ll leave time for questions at the end. Once the call is opened up for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to give everyone the opportunity to participate. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Dave Gitlin. Dave Gitlin : Thank you, Sam and good morning, everyone. Here\u2019s the quick summary, the second quarter was better than we expected driven by our continued cost reduction actions, progress on our top line initiatives and improvement in the US in June. We are raising the low end of our prior outlook for sales, adjusted operating profit and cash flow, enabling us to add back some targeted growth investments that we had previously scaled back. Before we get into details on our Q2 results and the outlook for the rest of the year. Let me start with some context. Slide 2, shows the four priorities that we established at the outset of the COVID pandemic. Our team has continued to respond aggressively and effectively on all of them. It starts with protecting and supporting our people. Our operations and field teams have continued in the workplace with limited interruption and we have gone to great length to ensure a safe environment for our people. We have distributed 2.5 million masks. Instituted thermal screening for 100% of our employees at our scale locations and deployed Carrier\u2019s healthy building program solution in our facilities to provide our people with as safe an environment as we possibly can. Our second priority has been to maintain business continuity to support our customers. While we experienced some short-term shutdowns by the end of the second quarter our factories and suppliers have resumed operations and we are now more than 95% of our production capacity availability. Our third priority is effectively managed cost in cash. Carrier 600 our program targeting $600 million of run rate savings within three years had initially targeted $175 million of savings in 2020. After 1Q, we increased that to $225 million of savings this year and we\u2019re now tracking to $250 million of recurring in year savings. We also announced one-time cost actions of $300 million. We remained on track there delivering $115 million in Q2. On cash, we have close to $5 billion of liquidity. We have $2.7 billion in cash on the balance sheet and we have access to $2 billion revolver. With updated covenants on that revolver and our term loan. We are very comfortable with our liquidity position. We are pleased that Q2 cash flow was materially higher than we had internally projected and we\u2019re now comfortable projecting at least $1.1 billion of free cash flow up from our prior estimate of at least $1 billion. We also declared our first dividend in Q2 demonstrating our confidence in the business. And fourth, we remain laser focused on ensuring that we position Carrier to emerge stronger from this pandemic. We are accelerating implementation of our strategic initiatives and investing in two key emerging trends. Healthy, safe and sustainable buildings and cold chain solutions. The COVID pandemic has underscored the role of buildings in helping ensure public health and we move quickly to launch our healthy buildings program. You see on Slide 3 where we stand on all our overall strategic priorities and our progress as a public company. As a standalone company, we launched the Carrier operating system and the Carrier Way and both are yielding early results. Our operating system includes a disciplined global deployment of lean in our factories. I was recently in our Charlotte factory and it was night and day versus a year ago. In just one year, our efficiency in that factory has improved by almost 15%. Our quality has improved by over 25% and our on-time delivery improved from 85% to 95% despite the challenging environment. The Carrier Way speaks to our behaviors, culture and values. There is a new energy within Carrier that is focused on customers, winning, agility, speed and innovation and that combination is resulting in some key new wins. And as we advance in our mission of creating solutions that matter for people in our planet. We recently released our first ESG report that highlights our progress and our environmental targets. Our commitment to effective and ethical corporate governance, actions to significantly improve our diversity and inclusion and helping to establish Carrier as the employer of choice. ESG is not a side activity at Carrier. It\u2019s core to our business. Always has been and we take pride in being leaders in this effort. We\u2019ve also been consistent in focusing on our three strategic pillars to drive sustained growth. In order to strengthen and grow our core business which is our first pillar. We continue to invest in R&D, sales people and digital. We originally plan to spend an incremental $150 million in these three key areas this year and after COVID hit. We scaled it back to $75 million. As we said, our incremental strategic investments would increase as we achieved more traction during the year. So with our improved outlook, we\u2019re bringing our incremental strategic investments up to approximately $100 million for this year. In terms of innovation, we continue to drive key new product introductions. For example, in Q2 we launched the Infinity 26 air conditioner and Infinity 24 heat pump that have the highest energy efficiency ratings amongst all ducted systems. Carrier Transicold launched its innovative Vector multi-temperature trailer refrigeration unit that addresses a key market need and initial demand has been very positive. And in our fire and security business, Kidde is launching new TruSense smoke detectors that are first to market compliant with the new UL standards and will significantly reduce nuisance alarms. And we\u2019re on track to add the 500 sales and support people that we previously planned. In our second pillar, which includes geographic expansion we continue to make strong progress in China with a key VRF win with the Sanya International Sports Industrial Park and also in China, our GSP fire business had an important win with [indiscernible] 1.3 million square foot commercial complex. And then the third pillar driving aftermarket and digital. We introduced the BlueEdge Service Platform providing customized tier solutions across the business. We remain on track to achieving 30% attachment rates in our commercial HVAC business this year helped by the launch of our assurance [ph] one program and digitally enabled lifecycle offerings are a clear focus for us and we\u2019re seeing traction. Our new digital platform for our residential and commercial national accounts achieved $100 million in ecommerce revenues in June. Our Super business signed a contract with six [ph] St. Louis area Realtor Associations to provide subscriptions-based access solutions to over 9,500 key holders and British supermarket retailer Asda signed a long-term support and telematics deal in conjunction with its order of more than 165 Carrier transicold Vector refrigeration units. And we\u2019re truly leaning in on the global imperative around healthy and safe buildings. We have a comprehensive product offering that includes all aspects of indoor air quality including filtration, ventilation and humidity along with sensing and controls. We\u2019ve complemented this with our fire and security portfolio to include touchless and traceability offering. And our LenelS2 business announced strategic collaboration with FLIR Systems. The world\u2019s largest and leading company specializing in thermal imaging cameras where we will resell FLIR\u2019s EST thermal imaging screening solutions with LenelS2\u2019s OnGuard access control system. We\u2019re integrating this multiple healthy and safe building offerings to provide our seven targeted verticals with a one stop shop solution. Society needs confidence. In the safety and health of indoor environments and customers are increasingly turning to Carrier for critical solutions as they reopen. As recent proof points, we signed a healthy buildings deal with Cushman & Wakefield to collaborate on deploying leading edge Carrier solutions. And we\u2019re working with [indiscernible] University to upgrade sensing and controls in their intelligent building focused on customer health and experience. We continue to fund these exciting growth initiatives through tenacious progress on Carrier 600 and G&A transformation. We remained focused on our overall business simplification that makes us more agile and externally focused. We launched Carrier Alliance to reduce our 6,000 suppliers and align with fewer more strategic partners. We are reviewing our 58 JVs for opportunities to improve our focus on growth initiatives. We have approved a project in our commercial HVAC business to digitize our internal and customer facing interface points in our European operations and we\u2019re assessing our overall back office footprint for reduction and consolidation by moving to a back office shared service center of excellence model. So lots of exciting progress strategically. Let me give you some color on orders on Page 4. We shared trends back in Q1 that showed the US and Europe still struggling while China had returned to prior year levels. Here, we showed detailed color on what we\u2019re seeing in this very fluid environment. Recalled that the US and EU make up 80% of our sales. In those regions, April and May were weak as expected with April orders down 25% and May down 15% year-over-year on a combined basis, to surprise with the strength of US orders in June up 40% from last year. US strength was led by resi where we saw orders up 100% in June helped by an increase in cooling degree days, pent up demand suppressed inventory levels. Also in the US, fire and security products orders grew in the high single digits in June after being down 30% to 40% in April and May and commercial HVAC orders were up low single digits in the US in June after being down 25% in April and May. The encouraging trends that we saw in June have carried forward to July where US and China orders have been up more than 20%. The EU orders have been down modestly compared to last year while South Asia remains very challenged. But despite a couple of good months of order trends, COVID cases continue to rise and economic visibility is uncertain. Therefore, we will continue to focus on what we control. Effectively managing the business during times of uncertainty and volatility and remaining flexible and opportunistic. With that, let me turn it over to Tim and I\u2019ll come back to summarize before we open it up for Q&A. Tim McLevish : Thanks Dave. Good morning. Please turn to Slide 5. As Dave just mentioned April and May were right on track with our expectations. June however saw a significant pickup in activity in the US as the economy reopened. That led to a substantial improvement in demand in North America residential HVAC, residential fire and North America trailer. Due to the strong North America shipments in June sales of almost $4 billion for the quarter were better than we had anticipated. They were however still down 20% compared to last year due to the COVID related shutdowns. And we continue to expect that the Q2 year-on-year sales decline will be the low point for the year. GAAP operating was $442 million, adjusted operating profit of $476 million was down 42% from last year. The COVID related volume and factory inefficiency pressure were partially offset by our aggressive cost actions. Our decremental margin was 34%. Absence is one-time items, the decremental margins would have been closer to 30%. Our Q2, GAAP EPS was $0.30 and adjusted EPS was $0.33. Since we were not a public company last year, the year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful. Our free cash flow was considerably higher than our expectations. This is largely attributable to favorable earnings and timing benefits in working capital and also the timing of other payments. These results were higher than would normally be reflected in our seasonal pattern. So all things considered, our performance in the second quarter was better than we would have expected in a very difficult environment. Let now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide 6. And note that the year-over-year number I\u2019ll refer to on this slide are organic comparisons. The HVAC segment sales were down 15% from last year. Within the segment, North America residential sales were down 13% as mentioned earlier. The opening up of many states combined with a warmer weather led to a substantial pick up in the month of June. We exited the quarter with a backlog about twice last year\u2019s level and inventories in the field down about 25%. So we expect strength to continue in the third quarter. The commercial HVAC business was down 17% with declines in most of the businesses. We saw decline of around 20% in light commercial although double-digit decline in applied and a mid-teens decline in the services business. China sales were up high single digits in the quarter. But South Asia was weak, especially in India which was heavily impacted by a prolonged lockdown. Applied sales were down less than overall commercial HVAC due to entering this slowdown with a healthy backlog in this longer cycle business. Light commercial was down more than the group because 80% of light commercial is replacement and many of those units are having very light duty, if at all. We did start to see an improvement in demand toward the end of the quarter as the markets began to reopen. This is an encouraging sign, but we still expect it to remain down year-over-year in the second half. Now over to refrigeration where sales were down 25%. North America truck trailer was down about 50%. Europe truck trailer was down close to 30% and container was down about 10%. We have however seen improved order activity with almost a tripling of the average weekly order rates from May to June for North America trailer. Container order activity was also encouraging in June. These are cyclical businesses that were declining from last year. But the recent activity suggest this Q2 could be the bottom for those markets. Commercial refrigeration was down almost 20% with weakness in Europe that more than offset a mid-teens increase in China. But we\u2019re encouraged to see order and [indiscernible] activity improving in both geographies. The fire and security segment was down 22%. The products business was down consistent with the segment. Declines in the Americas and Europe were partially offset by a recovery in China. We did see sequential improvement through the quarter as the declines in April and May tempered somewhat in June. The point of sale data for a residential fire products improved in June and we expect that to continue into Q3. The field business was down 23% due to March lockdowns across virtually all regions with particular weakness in Europe and Asia. While about 40% of this business is recurring having no or limited access to sites did put pressure on the installation and service portion of the business. Bottom line, there were some encouraging signs in several of our businesses in the back half of the quarter but with the ever-changing environment we remain flexible as an organization and ready to pivot as needed to market conditions. So we remain focused on controlling the controllables [ph] and on aggressive cost containment actions that will help us fund investments to position ourselves for future growth. Please turn to Slide 7. I will provide an update on our cost programs. In our Q1 call, we told you that we were taking aggressive cost actions in response to economic weakness caused by the pandemic. We accelerated Carrier 600 savings, reduced investment spending and initiated a $300 million cost containment program. These actions will more than offset the productivity and absorption impact from the lower volume by $250 million. Through the first half, the savings are tracking ahead of the pace of those for full year targets. Our intense focus on managing through the crisis in Q2 resulted in lighter investment spend in the quarter. As the markets recover and our results improve, we plan to restore some of the earlier investment cut backs. We still expect to generate net savings of $250 million. But we have up to 2020 target for Carrier 600 by $25 million and expect to redirect that increment to restore investments in R&D, salesforce and digital. These are expected to support growth in 2021 and to enable us to capitalize in some of the market trends emerging from the crisis. Continue on Slide 8, as Dave mentioned one of our top priorities for 2020 is to maintain ample liquidity. We performed well from a cash flow standpoint in the quarter and for the first half. The better than expected earnings, tightly managed working capital aided by some timing benefits led to much stronger cash flows for the first half than we had expected. On our first quarter call, we showed you our cash balance walk from the beginning of the year. With our favorable cash flow in Q2 and the issuance of $750 million in bonds. We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash. We were able to modify the covenants in our term loan and revolving credit agreement. Together with the bond issuance, the modifications further enhanced our liquidity and financial flexibility during this pandemic. With a solid cash balance and undrawn revolver an expected cash flow. We feel quite good about our liquidity and are confident we have access to the capital we need to weather this storm and to operate and grow the business. We told you last quarter, we would assess the timing and level of our dividend. In June, our board declared an $0.08 per share dividend which was paid just last week. Please turn to Slide 9 and I\u2019ll review our outlook. On our Q1 call, we discussed a number of scenarios based on a combination of macroeconomic projections like GDP, indicators more directly tied to our business like new housing starts, order trends, reasonable expectations, as the severity in duration of the crisis and likely recovery path. In light of our more favorable second quarter performance combined with a broader improvement in the market conditions. We\u2019re raising the bottom end of our prior outlook range for full year 2020. We now expect sales between $15.5 billion and $17 billion given the pleasant surprise of a stronger demand in June especially in the Americas. This raises the lower end by $500 million. We also increased the bottom end of the adjusted operating profit range by $100 million and are now projecting adjusted operating profit to be between $1.8 billion and $2 billion. And as mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve taken this opportunity to restore $25 million of the investment cutbacks we announced in the Q1 call. This is consistent with our comments at that time, that the pace of timing of bringing it back would track the recovery. Lastly, while much of the Q2 cash flow favorability was due to timing. We\u2019re now comfortable projecting at least $1.1 billion of free cash flow this year up from at least $1 billion identified in our previous outlook. This comes even after restoring some of the capital spending reductions we made earlier in the year. Capital spending is now expected to be in the $250 million to $275 million range compared to the prior $200 million to $225 million as we invest for future growth. We continue to reiterate that our outlook expects the current momentum in order and sales to continue. One additional note is that a number of the items you may need to bridge the adjusted operating profit EPS such as interest expense, tax rate and share count are in the appendix of this presentation. With that, let me turn it back over to Dave to say a few words before we open up for your questions. Dave Gitlin : Thanks Tim. We remain on track to navigating through this uncertain environment. We continue to focus on aggressive cost actions while driving key strategic initiatives. The quarter was better than we expected that enables us to increase the low end of our previous outlook while investing more in the second half to position us for growth in 2021 and 2022. Key trends around healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions position Carrier well for sustained growth. We feel confident in our medium-term outlook of mid single digits sales growth, high single-digit EPS growth and cash flow equal to net income. With that, we\u2019ll open this up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] and our first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : I just wanted to kick off on the resi debt [ph] point. I think you said down 13% or 14% some in the quarter. You\u2019re obviously all pretty much independent distribution so you\u2019ve got the [indiscernible] economic so, getting that Wasco [ph] had pre-significant inventory draw down. I\u2019m just wondering if you got any intel on how the sell through look so we can sort of judge, how market share trended versus some of comps [ph], that would be my first question. Dave Gitlin : Yes, we look at resi and like you said Nigel. We sell through distribution. So when you look at the shared number AHRI. You\u2019re really comparing the sales from our distributors direct to the dealer network comparing to some of our competitors that shipped direct. What was very encouraging to us, is a few things coming out of the quarter. Number one, as I mentioned in the remarks June was the highest orders month that we\u2019ve hand in our company\u2019s history. It was plus 100% and a lot of that strength in orders has continued into July where resi orders in July have continued to be extremely strong north of 50% year-over-year. The inventory levels at our distributors ending last quarter were down about 25%. So we\u2019re really - we started the quarter with low inventory levels at our distributors. We\u2019ve done our best to reacted as very strong demand that we saw coming into July that\u2019s continued into June that\u2019s continued into July. So we feel pretty well set up for 3Q. The biggest we have right now is supporting that demand operationally with our logistics team. Nigel Coe : It\u2019s a good problem have to, isn\u2019t it? And then on your [indiscernible] framework. Obviously, a little bit of a bump to the midpoint and I think -- of the prior framework call for mid-teens declined HVAC [indiscernible] down 10% and then refrigeration down 20% and I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m missed this. But how does that look right now, maybe in the second half of the year would be better sort of data points. How has that changed relative to what you saw back in early May? Tim McLevish : Nigel, this is Tim. I would say that I mean the same impact is hitting all of our businesses and roughly proportionally so. I would say that, the guidance we gave are overall for the company would be largely reflected by each of the business units. The one exception from an operating income standpoint would be our operating profit that we probably will have a bigger hit to profits for HVAC attributable to the decline in JV income and also that we probably have heavier investments of the $100 million incremental investment we talked about, this portion of share but will go into HVAC. Nigel Coe : But to be clear, the performance that translate [ph] in 2Q it doesn\u2019t change your view, that\u2019s going to be bit more of a good guide [ph] relative to the other segments. Tim McLevish : No, I\u2019d say they\u2019re going to be pretty proportional. Nigel Coe : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just first question around your overall perspectives on the non-residential markets across I suppose foreign security and HVAC in particular. But what are you expecting rather for the order intake there over the balance of the year? And maybe clarify for us, what proportion of your non-residential activities are tied to greenfield investments as opposed to replacements or aftermarket. Dave Gitlin : Okay, well. First Julian, just a reminder that when you look at our applied business. It\u2019s about 70-30. We\u2019re more heavily weighted towards OE versus service on the applied side. When we look at 2Q and then we\u2019ll kind of look forward with you. We feel on the applied side that, we had strengthened in the US and China I think in terms of share. We felt positive. We had committed. Chris had committed to getting us to number one within five years which really looks at about 50 bps of improvement a year and we felt pretty positive about the share gains that we saw in the US and China. We lagged in Europe and we need to fix that and we will. But we felt positive about US and China on the OE side. Services is an area where when we look at it some of our peers had a quicker jump on that trend and we did, so we\u2019re playing a little bit of a catch up there. There\u2019s a lot of focus, a lot of momentum we\u2019re putting the framework in place to really lean forward on services. But that scenario that there\u2019s a huge opportunity ahead. When you look at some of the macro trends overall ABI, is a really good leading indicator of course, the architectural billing index. You want that north of 50, it had been north of 50 coming into March, April, May it dropped down into the 30s and then June it was back up to 40, so positive trend there and we\u2019ll see if that bodes well as we look out six months. Light commercial was pretty rugged in April and May. It started to show better signs of progress a we\u2019ve gotten into June and July. But that for us is 80-20 on replacement over OE. So we\u2019re starting to see more activity in the light commercial space but some of those end markets remained challenged. Julian Mitchell : Thank you very much. And then maybe just a second question on the margin profile. I think Tim you talked about a one-timer perhaps weigh on decrementals. Maybe if you could just clarify sort of what you meant by that. And then also, as we look to the second half. It looks like the implied decremental margin is similar to what you had seen in Q2, just clarify that that\u2019s the case and is the main driver a sort of narrower sales decline, but perhaps some of those more steps up investments as you look ahead. Tim McLevish : Yes, I think you\u2019ve got it about right, Julian. So if you do the calculation and we come in about 34% decremental in Q2 and there\u2019s about 1% of it is, the impact of the public company cost relative to the last year and the second one is really in accounting adjustment to our long-term liabilities, is about 3%. So that brings you back to kind of the targeted 30% that we usually expect to see. With respect to the second half, again if you do the calculations. I mean we would prefer not to -- for everybody to assume this we\u2019ll be at the midpoint of each of the sales operating income etc. but if you did take that and you would calculate probably 45% decremental and about 10 percentage points of that is attributable to the investments. You recall. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we really, if you think that we didn\u2019t do much as we\u2019re part of UTC in the first quarter. Second quarter, we were quite distracted by responding to the COVID crisis and our customers and keeping our employees safe, etc. that Dave mentioned. So we spent very lightly on those investments. So the majority of what we had said was $75 million now incremented by $25 million, so $100 million in the second half of the year is about 10 percentage points. And the remainder about 5% bring us down to that 30% range would be attributable to the public company cost that will step up in the second half of the year as we particularly exit a lot of the TSAs and so forth from United Technologies and digital spend etc. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Steve Tusa : 100% increase is not that bad. Can you give us an idea of just regionally kind of the complexion of what you saw in residential? Were there any differences by region whether it\u2019s shortages in certain areas - different types of behavior in different parts of the country as the heat came on here or obviously 100% everything was up a lot? Just kind of curious as to what you saw on the ground regionally, if there were any major differences? Dave Gitlin : Steve, the Northeast as the heat hit there, we did see a nice pick up there and including in the West and into the Midwest. The South and Southwest was strong, but it had been strong. So when you look at cooling degrees up 12% in June. It was pretty wide spread and I do think that areas that had been pretty well shutdown, there was some pent-up demand. So we did see a nice snap back in some of those regions that hadn\u2019t been as strong as they had been in other parts. Mix, also although you didn\u2019t ask. I\u2019ll just mention that. On the product mix side, in the last call we said there was a bit of mixing down that we saw earlier on in April. But it kind of mixed back up to sort of normal levels on the [indiscernible] side. So that was encouraging as well. Steve Tusa : And then price for that business in the quarter. Dave Gitlin : Yes. Look we had thought there\u2019ll be a little bit of price tailwind. I mean it\u2019s sort of flat to slightly up. But it\u2019s - price is really neutral right now. Our biggest focus is honestly just supporting our customers. We really did not anticipate of course. It\u2019s hard to anticipate orders being up 100%. But the tremendous order activity that we saw has been significant. We were little bit fortunate in the sense that, we had pre-provisioned some inventory and we really did it because we were worried that COVID could impact operations. So we used some of that inventory [ph] that we had pre-provisioned to help delivery. But the key right now is for our resi operations and our logistics to just keep supporting our customers. Steve Tusa : And are suppliers like Copeland kind of keeping up with you guys? Dave Gitlin : Yes, it\u2019s not an operational issue. I mean we\u2019re having through [indiscernible] right now. If you look at both our facilities and our suppliers. Everyone\u2019s all hands-on deck supporting the activity. In fact the biggest challenge we have right now is on the warehouse and logistic side. Getting supporting warehouse activity into the trucking, into our logistics channel is, the bigger challenge we have right now operationally just given the sudden spike in demand. But operationally, I\u2019m pretty proud of our own team and our supplier partners. They\u2019ve really stepped up. Steve Tusa : And then one last one, are you re-evaluating it all in your portfolio analysis? The value of the more security type assets on the commercial side with this pandemic I know that you know some have gone after integrated buildings as a strategy. I think you guys were I feel like you guys were kind of still making that decision around what you kind of wanted to do with portfolio. Does this change it all that portfolio analysis when it comes to keeping that kind of content and that channel outside of HVAC with the security stuff? Dave Gitlin : Steve, we said that we would put every part of the portfolio through a very rigorous and clinical set of lenses. And if you look at the fire and security portfolio. It\u2019s really 60% products and 40% is that Chubb business, which is that field and installation business. The field and installation business is pretty agnostic. It doesn\u2019t pull through products so that gets a different assessment. The products piece that 60% of the business. What we\u2019re finding is there\u2019s tremendous synergy on a product side between that and our healthy building initiative. We\u2019re seeing it with some of our touchless offerings. We\u2019re seeing it even last night we announced this partnership with FLIR, where we\u2019re going to be reselling their thermal imaging camera capabilities and we\u2019re going to integrate into the BlueDiamond app. So when you look at a holistic set of one stop shop ecosystem of healthy buildings. The fire and security product portfolio fits very, very well and we see that in terms of real application. Normally, we would measure CO2 levels and then adjust the ventilation. But you can use the fire and security contact tracing to anticipate CO2 level rises and get into artificial intelligence and then use that to pre-ventilate. So there\u2019s some really interesting parts of that portfolio and some synergies that seemed to fit quite well. Steve Tusa : Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Jeff Sprague : Maybe just a pickup on Chubb there for a second. Fully understand what you said about kind of nature of it. But in essence it\u2019s also kind of an important customer touch point, isn\u2019t it? If you kind of look back maybe wish you had more distribution on the HVAC side and alike. Is there something more creative to do with that field force than what\u2019s been done historically? Dave Gitlin : Yes, look Chubb is a very solid business. And the interesting thing about Chubb is there\u2019s tremendous room for improvement in growth. It\u2019s no secret that UTC had, had it on the market and decided to take it off at the end of 2018. And that\u2019s been an obvious area that we\u2019d assess. There\u2019s sort of two aspects to the assessment, does it strategically fit and if it does not, when is the right time that you would look at divesting it? We\u2019re in the first phase of really assessing that right now and Chubb was hit very hard because it\u2019s very European centric. So if you look at 2Q, I think Chubb was down around 25%. So we really have our work to do in the second half to get the EBITDA and the performance up to levels that we would expect of the business. And then we\u2019ll asses the kind of question that you\u2019ve asked, does it fit from a distribution and touch point with customers or is it worth more in the hands of others and our focus right now is just on improving the performance for our customers and for ourselves. Jeff Sprague : And maybe second sort of related question, you also have other assets that maybe you could deem non-core, not the size of Chubb. Things like [indiscernible] if I\u2019m pronouncing that correctly and other things. What is your thought on monetizing some of the stuff and how it actually fits in your portfolio going forward? Dave Gitlin : Yes, we\u2019ve said that not only for every part of our product and service portfolio. but including our JVs you mentioned where we do have a stake in European distributor of refrigeration other equipment and it\u2019s a 37% stake and we said that, we would assess every aspect of our portfolio including the JVs and we will decide, is it worth more to us to continue to invest in those or is it worth more to monetize those and we\u2019ll make those decisions as we go forward. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Your line is now open. Gautam Khanna : Thanks for the great detail. So I had two questions. First just on the resi HVAC side, can you speak to any trends on mix and are you seeing patchwork repairs relative to system replacements? Any sort of trade down or what you would expect to be a trade down given the consumer is under some pressure or we\u2019re just seeing the opposite right now? Dave Gitlin : Yes, Gautam we\u2019re not seeing any mix down and we\u2019re not seeing customers favoring parts over full replacement. So we had been concerned about that. We\u2019ve been watching it closely and we haven\u2019t seen that materialize. I think that we\u2019re seeing a very positive combination of a lot of forces that is driving a lot of near-term activity. People are spending more time at home. They\u2019re not eating out. They\u2019re not traveling as much. So there\u2019s a lot of consumer spend on the home itself and I think that\u2019s helping. Of course the weather was some nice tailwind. I think our distributors were a bit under provisioned coming in so we\u2019re catching up with that. So there\u2019s a lot of forces in play to drive some very strong order demand. But we\u2019re not seeing a pickup in parts or mixing down. Gautam Khanna : Okay and just as a follow-up on the indoor air quality assessments that you\u2019re going to do for the commercial customers. How should we think about when these manifest in orders? Some of the solutions that you\u2019re now offering is this - I mean its early days but do you anticipate that we\u2019ll start to see meaningful bookings on this front in the second half of this year or is it more of a first half type of opportunity of next year? Dave Gitlin : This is thematic and we\u2019re at the early stages. But it\u2019s something that we would continue to anticipate would accelerate significantly as we go forward. We were seeing orders in 2Q on some of our - we introduced it as OptiClean, HEPA filter. The air scrubber machine and we\u2019ve seen very solid order activity. Whether it\u2019s a dentist office adding on or K-12 we\u2019ve seen very strong demand there. We\u2019ve seen it where we even thought chillers and some of the building operators have come back and said, can I upgrade the filtration system. So we would put that in a healthy building category. And we think that this is a trend that will withstand the test of time. So even post vaccine, whenever that comes. There\u2019s society shining a light on the criticality of the health and safety of indoor air environments. And the nice thing about Carrier\u2019s that we have a one stop shop ecosystem where we can address all vectors of what would create a healthy indoor environment. So we\u2019re in early stages. I would call the first phase of what we\u2019ve done is taken our core offerings and put those together for our vertical customers in a stop shop approach. Phase two, what you saw with FLIR last night is we\u2019re starting to add partners and fill other gaps into the ecosystem. So Carrier does become the go-to place for healthy and safe indoor environments. Gautam Khanna : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Deane Dray : I\u2019d like to stay with this indoor air quality theme and just the idea of how does the market develop. We understand holistically why there is a need. But do you expect this to be regulatory driven building codes or will it start from just building-by-building engineers deciding this is what they need? Dave Gitlin : I think the answer is yes. I think it\u2019s going to be a combination of code driven and customer-by-customer. I think what you\u2019re seeing is a lot of verticals looking to give their customer\u2019s confidence in coming back into these public environments. So whether it\u2019s university or K-12 or other schools globally. They\u2019re stepping up and asking the right questions about what changes do I need to make and you\u2019re seeing it for commercial office buildings. You\u2019re seeing it for hospitals and airports. So I think there\u2019s an element of individual customer demand state-by-state, country-by-country. But you\u2019re also seeing some of the regulatory bodies and it could be an organization like ASHRAE coming forward with specific standards that, I know us and our competitors would all support. So I think that there will be a balance between customer demand and the regulatory piece. But I can tell you that the amount of activity and questions and quoting that we\u2019re doing is really picking up in a positive way. Deane Dray : That\u2019s great to hear. Can you spend a moment talking about how you\u2019re differentiating competitively in terms your go-to-market? Again on this indoor air quality. You mentioned the OptiClean, the filter. Are you looking at UV as a potential add on? And talk about the monitoring capability beyond just CO2? Dave Gitlin : I think what really differentiates Carrier is the holistic capabilities that we have. So obviously we have all aspects of HVAC. Within HVAC and indoor air quality. We have a multi-prong approach to filtration. So yes, for homes we use electrostatic filters. We have HEPA filters, we\u2019re using bipolar ionization and we have capabilities around UVC. So we have a pretty comprehensive portfolio when it comes to filtration. But the same comes with our ability to do customized ventilation approaches because it is very application specific. And the same with controlling humidity levels. Then you get into the controls and we have our ALC business that has controls capability. And then when you integrate all of the HVAC and sensing and controls capability that we have there with our fire and security portfolio and then you can make it a one stop shop for customers through a natural interface point. Whereas you picture walking into a restaurant and you look at a computer screen, it can give you a red, yellow, green and all aspects of that healthy and safe indoor environment. So we can provide the controls, we can provide the user interface experience for our customers whether it\u2019s through the controlled system or an overlay-controlled system. We have the ability to connect the dots. I think in a fairly unique way for our customers. Deane Dray : That\u2019s real helpful color. Thank you. Sam Pearlstein : Can we just go to one last question, Gigi? Operator : Of course. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vlad [indiscernible] from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Unidentified Participant : Maybe just one more follow-up on the healthy buildings and indoor air quality. Maybe it should be obvious but you mentioned that you are implementing this in your own facilities. So can you talk about as you begun to roll this out in your facilities what you started to learn about the ease or difficulty of implementing some of these measures and what the employee response has been in terms of the feedback or feeling of the security in the facilities as these measures have come out? Dave Gitlin : Yes that\u2019s the beauty of - even the building that we\u2019re doing this call from today is our Center for Intelligent Buildings here in Palm Beach Gardens in Florida and this is basically a showcase of our capabilities and it\u2019s also kind of an existing lab we have to make it the best in class building for healthy and safe indoor environment. So for example, we have significantly more ambient air in this facility than most commercial buildings. We have a designated outdoor air system. So we continue to leverage that to maximize the amount of ambient air. When COVID hit, we started to use more bipolar ionization. We have a relationship with a company called GPS. So we implemented their capabilities in our filtration system there. It\u2019s combined with a HEPA filter as well. So we\u2019ve been using this building to really validate a lot of our apps. So we have our BlueDiamond app that\u2019s part of our LenelS2 business. And what we\u2019re hearing from our employees in this building because right now for office employees at Carrier. It\u2019s still voluntary whether to come back to the office. But we\u2019re seeing an uptick in people coming back to the office because they know we\u2019re investing in the health and safety of the indoor environment. They see it when they get their temperature taken when they come in the morning. They can see it through their app interfaces. So it\u2019s really having a direct correlation to employees coming back in the investments that we\u2019re making. Unidentified Participant : That\u2019s great to hear and then maybe just a last follow-up from me. You had mentioned earlier in the call, a back-office review that was underway with a look to go to more of a shared services model overtime. Can you just clarify whether that cost potential savings from that - would that be all under what you\u2019ve anticipated under the Carrier 600 umbrella or is that sort of new initiative that can be incremental savings overtime. Tim McLevish : Well [indiscernible] this is Tim. It\u2019s an initiative that we had envisioned for since kind of the inception. It is part of the Carrier 600, we carved out about $100 million of the Carrier 600, that what we call the G&A savings. And we\u2019re setting up what we call - it\u2019s a GBS, it\u2019s a Global Business Services center and we will centralize a lot of the back-office activity. We\u2019re starting with the cash application. We\u2019re starting with accounts payable. We\u2019re starting with some of the accounting back office routine activity. We call it in the reporting of accounting and we\u2019re setting up facilities and probably three or four places around the world. We have one in Prague today. We\u2019re going to set one up in India. We have one in the United States. We\u2019ll put another one down in Mexico and we anticipate it\u2019s a labor arbitrage of the cost structure, but it\u2019s also an efficiency. We\u2019ll employee state-of-the-art tools, to reduce cost and yes, that is part of the Carrier 600 and is well underway. I won\u2019t say that to-date we have realized the savings. We\u2019re still in the process of the setting it up. But you\u2019ll see them soon. Unidentified Participant : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I\u2019m showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks. Dave Gitlin : Okay, thank you. And thanks everyone for joining us always. Sam is available for follow-up questions. We look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming months and thank you for your time today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With me here today are David Gitlin, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim McLevish, Chief Financial Officer. Except as otherwise noted, the company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a nonrecurring and/or nonoperational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Carrier's registration statement on Form 10 and the reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. This morning, we will review our financial results for the third quarter of 2020, discuss the full year 2020 outlook, and we'll leave time for questions at the end. Once the call is opened up for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue if time permits. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Thank you, Sam, and good morning everyone. Before we get going, let me first comment on the upcoming CFO transition that we announced last week. Patrick Goris currently the CFO at Rockwell Automation will be joining us as our CFO in a couple of weeks. At that point, Tim will take on the role of Senior Advisor, helping us with a smooth transition to Patrick and taking on specific key projects until his retirement in mid-February. For context, when we hired Tim, he was very clear with us that his role would be to help effectively stand us up as a public company, including building the finance team and function, strengthening the balance sheet, helping us establish our strategic priorities, working with the rating agencies and investment community and charting the course for his successor. Doing all that in more, Tim has been the perfect CFO at the perfect time. I can't thank him enough for everything he has done for me personally and for Carrier. After a thorough search, I could not be happier to have Patrick joining us. I suspect most of you know him well. During his time at Rockwell, Patrick transformed the finance function, helped drive industry-leading top and bottom line performance and a shift toward a recurring revenue model. And he was instrumental in guiding strategic capital allocation and portfolio optimization. We look forward to welcoming Patrick to the Carrier team. With that, please turn to Slide 2, where I'll discuss our Q3 highlights. In short, Q3 was a very encouraging quarter. Sales of $5 billion were up 4% year-over-year and substantially exceeded our expectations. Adjusted operating profit was up 6% year-over-year. We had strong incrementals in the quarter putting our reported year-to-date decrementals at 30%, but operationally at 26% factoring in the $53 million of additional public company costs. Our performance was driven by continued strength in North America residential HVAC, which was up 46% in the quarter and by continued traction on our costs and growth initiatives. In resi, this was our highest quarter ever for both sales and operating profit. We are pleased with our free cash flow generation in the quarter, which was $880 million, primarily driven by higher net income and better working capital performance. And we realized $300 million of cash before taxes from our sale of 9 million shares in Beijer. We continue to aggressively reduce costs via a strategic disciplined approach, including reducing G&A and simplifying the back-office. As a result, we are now raising Carrier 600 to Carrier 700, which cost for $700 million of recurring costs takeout by the end of 2022. This will allow us to fund investments in growth, while driving margin expansion. We remain on track to invest in incremental $100 million in growth initiatives this year. Based on our Q3 strength, we are again raising our 2020 full year outlook on sales, adjusted operating profit and free cash flow. Given that we had $3.8 billion of cash at the end of the quarter, we plan to pay down $1.5 billion of debt in the fourth quarter. Next year, we expect to do more while supporting our dividend and preserving flexibility for M&A opportunities. Pivoting now to Slide 3 on our progress and our overall priorities, we put in place a playbook that is gaining traction. Adoption of the Carrier Way has created a profound cultural transformation, which is resulting in an agile, innovative, aggressive, winning focused organization, all of which is helping fuel our growth agenda. It starts with ensuring a performance culture, putting our customers first. And through a rigorous deployment of Carrier Excellence and our Supplier Excellence program, our on-time delivery has increased in 96% and our quality and performance has improved 30% year-to-date. We continue to invest in our growth initiatives. We have added an incremental 450 sales and sales support personnel this year and have introduced a number of innovative offerings, including the first fully autonomous, all-electric engineless refrigerated trailer system in Europe, and a new multipurpose cloud-connected commercial fire detector that combined smoke detection with advanced sensing capabilities. And in terms of services, aftermarket and digital initiatives, our commercial HVAC business closed the quarter at a 27% attachment rate globally, on track to achieve 30% by the end of this year. We have signed over 300 BlueEdge contracts since the program launched in June. We are also continuing to drive connected offerings across the network. For example, in the commercial refrigeration business, we completed a very successful pilot on our condition-based maintenance program, improving uptime by about 33% and improving technician productivity by over 20%. In Fire & Security, our Kidde Fire Systems business shipped its first orders for in IntelliSite, a remote health monitoring service for industrial fire alarm and suppression system control units. At a Carrier Enterprise level, we are truly leaning into the emerging trends around healthy, safe, and sustainable building and cold chain solutions, which you see on Slide 4. Starting with healthy, safe, and sustainable buildings. Our strategy here is to be the leading one-stop shop provider, which is driving strong customer interest and new product introductions that continue to gain traction. We obtained independent validation through a rigorous testing process that our Infinity air purifier\u2019s capture and kill technology inactivates 99% of coronavirus trapped on the filter, the first of its kind. Orders for those filtration systems were up 140% year-over-year in the third quarter. We also have orders for nearly 15,000 OptiClean units, and we are working in active pipeline for 1,000 more. Through our relationship with Cushman & Wakefield, we were able to upgrade a Denver-area office campus with air purification systems with needlepoint bipolar ionization technology for every rooftop unit on its campus, along with service by Carrier's BlueEdge platform. And we just signed a strategic HVAC deal at the 54 One Court Square Tower in Long Island City, which we estimate will save up to 20% in energy cost annually and deliver improved comfort and air quality. For the healthy building space overall, we now have an active pipeline of potential order activity of $150 million. And we're still in the early stages of putting the comprehensive strategy in place to maximize our offerings and capture the opportunity ahead of us. Similarly, we recently launched our healthy, safe, and sustainable cold chain program. I am thrilled with our new relationship with Amazon Web Services, with whom we are partnering to develop a robust and powerful data ecosystem for cold chain operations. We also introduced Carrier Pods monitored by our Sensitech business to support added mobile cold chain capacity and cargo insights. With key partners, we're working to connect the dots to provide a one-stop shop approach for cold chain solutions for both food and pharma distribution. So we've made progress on our financial results, our performance culture, strategic growth initiatives, and capital allocation. Before I turn it over to Tim, let me give you some color on current order trends. Slide 5 outlines our three segments, which we have broken into two key business lines each. We also provide color by geographic region, starting with HVAC. You see here that our Residential & Light Commercial orders were up 60% year-over-year on the quarter, driven by resi. Movement from distribution to dealers with strong and distribution inventory levels are now in balance. For Commercial HVAC, orders improved from down about 15% in Q2 to almost flat in Q3. In our Refrigeration segment\u2019s transport business, order trends indicate that Q2 was the bottom for our truck trailer business. Unit order rates more than doubled from June to September, container orders were down in Q3, but these tend to be lumpy and we have seen solid October orders. Commercial Refrigeration orders were also down in the quarter, but improved sequentially from Q2. For Fire & Security products, orders improved from down 20% in Q2 to down about 10%. We saw improvement in commercial and residential fire, China and the controls business while the small and medium-sized business, oil and gas and hospitality markets were weak. The F&S field business orders improved from down almost 30% in Q2 to down around 5% in Q3. Installation and non-recurring service orders were down around 10%, given the discretionary nature of that work, while recurring service and monitoring orders were flat. Our business has reflected the bifurcated macro economy, where residential, healthcare, education, data centers and warehouses have remained strong, while the oil and gas, small and medium businesses and hospitality verticals remain challenged. Fortunately, the latter verticals are a much smaller part of our portfolio. We see the same bifurcation geographically, where the U.S. and China remains strong. Europe is recovering and Asia, excluding China is very challenged. While we're encouraged by Q3 order trends, we recognize the continued global uncertainty and we remain prepared to adapt. With that, I'll turn it over to Tim and then come back to summarize before Q&A. Tim? Tim McLevish : Thanks, Dave. Good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. As Dave just mentioned the quarter surpassed what we had expected as we saw very strong demand in residential HVAC and continued recovery in the broader markets in which we participate. Recall that last quarter, we said that we believed the Q2 year-on-year sales decline would be the low point for the year. That proved to be the case as Q3 sales of $5 billion did not decline, but in fact, we're up almost 4% over the prior year and 3% organically. This is driven primarily by residential HVAC, while we saw sequential improvement across the company since the second quarter, we still had modest year-over-year sales declines in the majority of our businesses in Q3. GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion and that includes a $252 million gain on the sale of about 9 million shares in Beijer. Adjusted operating profit of $867 million was up 6% from last year. Our incremental margin was 27% and this number would be materially higher absent the incremental public company and TSA costs. Accelerated productivity and continued cost control drove a strong performance on margins. Our Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.84 and adjusted EPS was $0.67. Since we\u2018re not a public company last year, the year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful. Our free cash flow was strong, considerably higher than we had expected. The biggest driver was higher net income, but we also saw a working capital improvement and a favorable timing impact from interest and tax payments. All things considered a very strong third quarter for Carrier in a very difficult environment. Let's now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide 7, and note that the year-over-year numbers to which I will refer are organic comparisons. The HVAC segment sales were up 11% from last year, within the segment residential was up 46%. We are very proud of how well the team executed on unprecedented levels of demand that enabled us to gain share. Recall that we ended Q2 with field inventory levels down about 25%. At the end of Q3, we saw field inventories back to prior year levels and expect a more normalized Q4 in that business. COVID created very atypical seasonality for residential as Q2 was down materially and Q3 was unusually strong and we expect the full year 2020 will likely end up as a fairly normal year in total. In North America Light Commercial, we saw a sales decline of 13%. We did see sequential improvement during the Q3, as reopenings continued, but we expect light commercial to continue to lag this year. Commercial HVAC sales were down 7% with modest declines in most of its business lines. We saw a low single-digit decline in applied and a high single-digit decline in the services businesses. Applied sales were down less than the overall commercial HVAC, as we entered this slowed down with a healthy backlog in this longer cycle business. All of these year-over-year declines improved from those in the second quarter. From a regional perspective for commercial HVAC, China sales were up about 10% in the quarter, but Asia excluding China was weak, especially India, as it remains heavily impacted by disruptions related to COVID. We are confident we gained share in China and North America in applied. Now over to refrigeration, where segment sales were down 6%. North America truck trailer was down about 30%, but that reflects almost a 50% improvement from the trough we saw in Q2. Europe truck trailer was down close to 10% and container was up mid single-digit. We saw improving order trends for both North America and Europe truck and trailer and believe we have turned the corner on the down cycle in both businesses. Commercial refrigeration sales were flat in the quarter, as a modest decline in EMEA was offset by mid single-digit growth in Asia. Moving over to Fire & Security segment, which was down 7%. The products business was down consistent with the segment, declines in the Americas and Europe were partially offset by double-digit growth in China. Within the Americas, our residential fire products business grew low single-digits, which was offset by declines at some of our security businesses that are more impacted by the slowdown in the small business and hospitality markets. The field business is also down in line with the segment. As restricted building access and lagging commercial construction activity drove mid-to-high single-digit declines on install and repair jobs, that effect was partially offset by low single-digit growth in the recurring service piece of the business. Bottom line, we saw continued encouraging trends across the company with a pace of recovery differing in some areas. While we have observed more normalizing market conditions, we continue to focus on controlling the controllables and on aggressive cost management that will help us fund investments to position us for future growth. Please turn to Slide 8. I'll provide an update on our cost programs. In each quarter this year, we have accelerated our in-year savings plan for Carrier 600. With that success, we are now confident in increasing the three year target to $700 million and renaming the program Carrier 700. On this slide, you'll see that the $250 million target for 2020 for Carrier 700 and the planned investment of $100 million remain unchanged. We had previously discussed spending about $300 million over three years for investments in R&D, digital and sales, and we still expect to do so. You'll notice that our savings from cost containment actions is now $250 million, down from $300 million that we discussed last quarter, because the business has been executing at a much higher level, in the fourth quarter, we are restoring some of the temporary people related cost actions taken earlier this year. Also updated from last quarter is the headwind from productivity and absorption issues related to the pandemic. Better than expected volumes as well as strong execution has resulted in the absorption headwinds not being quite as bad as we had anticipated. If you recall, our original model for Carrier 600 was at the savings we generated would fully fund our growth in investments and the remainder would drop through. With about $100 million in year-over-year headwind expected for 2021 from the reversal of one-time cost containment measures, it will require a larger portion of our Carrier 700 benefits. This means less of the savings should drop to the bottom line and could impact our incremental margins next year. Continuing on Slide 9. As we've said, a key priority during the pandemic has been to maintain ample liquidity. And as you see on this slide, our strong focus on cash has enabled very good free cash flow, which was driven by better than expected earnings and tightly managed working capital. We exited the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash on the balance sheet, which was helped by the partial sale of our shares in Beijer. As conditions in the market have improved, we now plan to pay down $1.5 billion in debt before the end of the year, a big step towards our debt repayment plans. With a healthy balance sheet, we are well positioned to emerge from the pandemic on a stronger footing and capitalize on the opportunities as we returned to a more normalized environment. As a result, we expect to be in a position to communicate more details on our capital allocation priorities early next year. Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll review our outlook. On our Q2 call, we gave you guidance ranges that reflected the broader uncertainty associated with the economic climate we were experiencing. Now was two months to go in the year, we can provide a more precise and improved outlook from what we gave you in July. We now expect sales to be about $17.3 billion higher than the high end of our prior guidance range, this is based on the significant strength we saw in residential HVAC in Q3 and the broader economic improvement. We expect adjusted operating profit of approximately $2.2 billion, which is also above the high end of our prior range. This reflects the drop through from the higher sales outlook. On free cash flow, we now expect to generate about $1.5 billion in 2020, a significant improvement from our prior outlook of at least $1.1 billion. The biggest driver of the cash flow is higher net income along with continued tight working capital management and a few timing items. With that, I'll hand it back to Dave to wrap things up before Q&A. David Gitlin : Thanks, Tim. Our results demonstrate that we are successfully navigating through this unprecedented environment. We continue to focus on aggressive cost actions while driving our key strategic growth initiatives. We remain confident in our three to five year medium-term outlook of mid single-digit sales growth, high single-digit EPS growth and strong cash flow. Given the lower base from the COVID driven disruption in 2020, recent order trends and the execution of our strategy we anticipate pulling those medium-term growth rates into next year. With that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. David Gitlin : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So I just want to understand that just the full year guidance a little bit better. So clearly 3Q turned out to be just a lot stronger than we anticipated, and as I think about the 4Q sequential, is it the way to think about it that sequentially 4Q is going to be lower this year? Just because 3Q it turned out to be a lot stronger than expected driven by resi. I'm just trying to understand I mean 4Q guide. Tim McLevish : Yes, Joe. This is Tim. Well 4Q we have some I mean, yes, resi was particularly strong in Q3 and that drove a lot of our Q3 favoribility. We're expecting a bit more normalized Q4 as they are transitioning kind of from splits of air conditioners into furnaces. So it will be a bit more normalized than we saw in Q3, but also in Q4, we are anticipating, remember, we have about $25 million of quarterly impact from year-on-year effect from our public company cost. And we do anticipate that we're going to spend about $75 million of the $100 million that we've set aside for investments. You might ask the question why, so back-end loaded. But the reality of it is, this year we started out with an expectation, we're going to invest $150 million before the COVID hit, we scaled that back considerably. And now we reinstated as things are looking better, but it takes a little bit of time to ramp down and ramp back up. So we have baked in there about $75 million of our investment to hit. And there is about $20 million of other kind of transition related things from UTC as we standalone as public company. So adjusting for those things, you would see that as much more normalized fourth quarter. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Appreciate the color there, Tim. I guess my follow-on question is, as you think about 2021, obviously, really encouraging to see Carrier 600 step up to Carrier 700 and also the non-recurring cost containment action stepping down this year. As we kind of think about the puts and takes, especially on the margins for next year, I guess is a way to think about this belief that there is probably going to be more goodness than from the cost reduction savings from Carrier 700 and then less of a headwind also from the temporary cost actions that you took this year? Tim McLevish : Well, Joe, this is Tim. I'm unbalanced, I mean, if you look at the cost containment measures, and we step that down to 350, we probably will still get some carryover, probably travel will not snap back fully, but also we identified that our \u2013 the impact from productivity related to the COVID has stepped down a little bit, unbalanced across that we probably have a $100 million of headwind \u2013 net headwind from those actions. And it probably is going to take a little bit more of the Carrier 700 than typically would experience. I mean, we haven't set up think about the average remaining of 450 on a Carrier 700 versus the 250 we've experienced already, and then subtract out the investments and then probably we'll use a little bit of the Carrier 700 remaining to cover some of that year-on-year document. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. I'll get back in queue. Thank you all. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Stephen Volkmann : Hi, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. It appears that your share is improving pretty broadly, so I guess I just wanted to touch on that. Maybe you could talk about areas where you think you've done best in share relative to the market. And Dave, I think you said the salesforce was up like 450 people or something. Is that process kind of done now? Or is there anything else that these guys are doing, any change incentive compensation? Just kind of how are you managing the salesforce and driving those share gains? Thanks. David Gitlin : Yes, let me hit the first one first. On resi share gains, yes. I mean, look, we grew 46% in the quarter, we were really 2x the overall market. So clearly we picked up share in the third quarter. But it's really not, I think fair for us to look at just one quarter at a time. If you look at it over a 12 month period, we picked up about a 100 basis points of share, which is I think a better indicator. But look, we've said that we were going to really lean into growth and focus on really winning out in the marketplace. And I think our team, Chris Nelson, Justin Keppy, and the team have done a really nice job of that partnering with our distributors. So we've seen it really across the U.S. and it's not just splits, we've seen it on the furnace side as well. I think part of it was the fact that operationally we were able to perform and provide units to the dealers, there is been some dealer conversion. And I think the other factor is that we came into the quarter with somewhat depressed inventory levels with our distribution channels, inventory levels coming into 3Q were down about 25% year-over-year. And then you kind of look at the sudden spike we saw in orders in June that carried forward into July and August. We really had to turn up the heat to make sure that we could support our customers. And frankly, it was a challenge. Our customers have done a great job working with us, but we did - it was quite a ramp to support them. But on balance we've been very pleased with the share gains, the key is that we sustain that going forward. I think in terms of the salespeople, the 450 we refer to is that's really mostly outside of resi where we've been looking at that in both the applied space on the OE side, as well as in services and aftermarket. And that's a very much global phenomenon, we've been adding those mostly in China, in North America a little bit in Europe, which has been a bit more challenged to add them there. But \u2013 and I don't think that's the end of it, we had come into this year saying that we had a deficit versus some of our competitors, we said, we'd add 500, we've added 450 and I think we'll end up adding more as we go into next year. Stephen Volkmann : Great. Thanks. And then just quickly anything to call out relative to the resi trends in October so far? David Gitlin : So far so good. I mean the orders that we've seen in October have been strong, so we'll have to see how things play out. We're trying to work with our distributors to give them the product they need when they need it. So orders have remained strong and we're working with them to work on managing that delivery schedule. Normally at this time a year, we'd be ramping down and we're not doing that, we're continuing to support our customers through the off season as we kind of gear up for 1Q and beyond. Stephen Volkmann : Okay. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe \u2013 and want to say Tim, thanks for all the help since the spin. But maybe a follow-up question on the savings versus investments. So as you said, there is sort of $450 million of savings left after this year. And you implied maybe around $200 million of extra investment, just wanted to check that, and any thoughts around the split of that $450 million and $200 million between next year and the year after? And is there any sort of baseline operating leverage number we should dial in? I think you talked about 28% to 30% previously. Is there any kind of minimum level that you calibrate around? David Gitlin : Yes. Julian, let me start at a high level and then ask Tim to add on. I think as we think about 2021 and going forward, we do think ourselves \u2013 let me start even on the sales side is that we had said that we would grow on the top line mid single-digits. What I would have told you a couple months ago is that we were kind of at the high end of mid single-digits, but we've been a bit surprised by the resi strength that we've seen over the last couple months. So it's probably still mid single-digits, but more at the low end of that. And we've been consistent that incrementals would be in that 30% range, give or take various moving parts in the system. And then you have all of these costs puts and takes between our increase on Carrier 700, so we have 450 to go, you could probably consider 225 a year, next year and the year after that. We have the $100 million of sort of one-time headwind going into next year because of the one-time \u2013 $100 million of one-time savings that we incurred this year. And then we have incremental investments. So I think what you're really looking at is the sales growing mid single-digits, probably at the lower end and then the drop through on those sales. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you, Dave. And then maybe my second question would be around the sort of portfolio, and you started I think some cleanup actions with that partial Beijer stake sale a few weeks back. Do you think that the macroenvironment is now conducive to a sort of steady pace of maybe some of that portfolio rationalization? And how quickly do you want to try and take that process to help with the balance sheet delevering? David Gitlin : Yes. We've remained consistent that the single best thing we can do to create shareholder value is execute on our long range plan. You actually just reviewed it with our board. We've done a very detailed assessment by business unit, we've done our strat reviews, we've done our LRPs and the way we run the business is that for all of our strategic initiatives, we track those with significant clarity and focus. And we are very confident that we can create significant shareholder value by making sure that we have a performance culture that we're laser focused on the cost side, but also on our growth initiatives, which is really using some new muscles within Carrier, but it's getting great traction. And then we've said that we would take a very clinical look at our portfolio, including the 58 JVs, and you saw some actions that we did take in 2Q, we continue to look at every JV to make sure that they really are the best use of our capital. And we'll look at some bolt-on M&A, and perhaps some divestitures over time, but in terms of sort of the bigger transformative transactions, our biggest focus right now is executing on our LRP. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. David Gitlin : Good morning, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : David, just want to dig into the commercial side of the house. Order is flat, pretty spectacular there, anything more that you can tell us on the order front? I know it's not really a channel, especially on applied where there is inventory, but anything from a replenishment standpoint or a comp that we should keep in mind? Because I guess just given the mix of business there and what we're seeing in non-resi construction, there should at least be a little bit of headwind. So that surprises me as being particularly strong. David Gitlin : Yes. Look, I think that it's quite bifurcated, there is some real strength in applied, when you look at things like data centers and healthcare and warehouses. We're seeing continued strength globally, especially in China and the U.S. Education has picked up quite well, not only K-12, but universities, commercial buildings, a bit of a watch item. We know there is some real headwinds things like retail, hospitality, restaurants that has a more acute impact on our light commercial business. So when we look at it one encouraging metric that we did see pop up a bit was ABI, the Architectural Billing Index, which is a good forward-looking indicator, it's been hovering around 40, we saw it go up to 47, we would like to see that north of 50. Dodge construction year-to-date is down about 20%, but only about 15% of our business ties to that metric. So I think when you put that all together, it's a watch item, there is some encouraging areas and where it's strong. I think we've really leaned into and seeing some share gains, China has been particularly strong and I'm quite proud of the team there and North America has been continuing to recover. So I look at it, I think we're going to exit this year with our applied business backlog up around 5% or 10% going into next year, but it's clearly a watch item and we'll have to keep monitoring it. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's very helpful. And then I think this whole kind of industry group has turned into the collection basin for IAQ and discussion around building energy efficiency. And it sounds like Carrier is clearly part of that with some of your opening remarks. Anything that you can talk about in terms of seeing this actually show up with customers, sizing and opportunity. You mentioned some rooftop opportunity there. I think most people would consider this kind of applied first, unitary second. I know there is kind of a lot to unpack in that question, but maybe just kind of level set us on what you're seeing out there and how that would fall into kind of the various slices of Carrier\u2019s exposure. Thanks. David Gitlin : Yes. Josh, I would tell you that we are very encouraged by not only the trends we're seeing in IAQ, but the opportunity. It starts with the premise that people spend 90% of their time indoor. So if you're 50 years old, you've spent 45 years on this earth indoors. And you look at the amount of indoor square footage that's going to double over the next 40 years. So when you look at something like COVID, it's really shine to light on the criticality of making sure that people have healthy, safe and sustainable indoor air environment. So the way we've approached it is really twofold, one is introduce new products, things like OptiClean, the certification of our electrostatic filters for the home. We're working on air purifiers, we're working on new types of filtration, whether it's UV or bipolar ionization and really round out the portfolio and get those to market and there is been significant pull. On top of that, we've been working on more customized solutions that look at more broader ventilation solutions about airflow and air changes per hour that are more holistic changes. And then the broader solution is ultimately going to be something that gets into independent assessments about the healthy and safe and indoor air quality, we'll work on a digital solution. So tenants have visibility to whether or not the indoor air environment is up to standard. And then we'll be rolling that out in a more holistic way. When we look at the market size, we get this question a lot and here's what I'd say, if you look at the products that we sell into, our HVAC systems, our Fire & Security systems, that total market is about $90 billion to $100 billion. And we think that the additional opportunity created through IAQ is about 10%. So call it $9 billion to $10 billion. And one thing I can tell you is that I'm extremely confident that we'll get more than our fair share of that piece. Now it takes some time to build up, I talked about a pipeline of $150 million, we continue to see real traction, real customers making orders. So it's going to take some time to build up to that number, but we do think it's certainly within our sites over time. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey, that's great color. Thanks so much, Dave. And I feel like I've had 45 years just in 2020, so I can certainly speak for myself there. David Gitlin : I\u2019ll endorse. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. And Tim thanks for the health and good luck next chapter. Tim McLevish : Thanks, Nigel. Nigel Coe : I'm guessing there won't be too many coupling questions today. And so I'm just guessing that. But going back to the resi performance and I understand that obviously benefits from channel is still there. But I'm just curious, do you have any intelligence on your sell-through of the Carrier brands to your channels? Because obviously the market looks like it's up high-teens, but I'm just curious how your sell-through compared from be back out that impact from the channel? David Gitlin : Yes. We closely track the movement from our distributors to our dealers and it's been consistent with what we would have thought. I think the encouraging thing is the inventory levels at our distributors ending 3Q is about what we would have seen at those inventory levels last year. So when you look at the very unusual swings that you saw Q3 down something like 13%, excuse me \u2013 Q2, Q3 up 46%. When we get into next year there is going to be unbelievably unprecedented compares as we're trying to explain what happened in 2Q and 2Q \u2013 and 3Q of next year. But when you look at it more holistically for the year, the whole market is going to be up mid single-digits, we\u2019ll be up high single-digits this year. So not an incredibly unusual year, just unusual phasing within the year. Nigel Coe : Yes. That's the show. And then speaking of compares, I think last year you had a really tough compare on furnaces with the kind of the rebuild that happens through the spring and summer. So I'm expecting you to do quite well both with the markets in 4Q, just given that dynamic, is that fair? David Gitlin : Well, I think that our 4Q should be strong on resi, clearly not 46%, but I would guess in the 15% to 20% range. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's great color. And then maybe just one more question, can we just touch on the federation margins? They were a little bit weaker than what we expected. So just wondering, what we saw there in terms of mix and maybe [indiscernible] leverage. And then as we now going to come into 2021, expecting strong trends from truck and trailer. Would you expect the further margins to be north of that 30% range for that segment? Tim McLevish : Yes. And Nigel, I'll take it. First of all I will say, when you look at detrimental for that segment of the business and refrigeration, first of all, you get kind of what I call the law of small numbers. There was a $46 million decline in sales and the operating profit decline was a small piece of that. But within it, you had a mix between CCR, our commercial refrigeration business and transport. Commercial was a top line, pretty flat and modestly down in the bottom line. Transport, obviously our high margin business was down about 10% on balance across that business, and down saved $15 million to $20 million on the bottom line. There were a couple of other small charges in there. So that really explains the very high detrimental for the business, but it \u2013 I would say to your last question, when we see that turnaround and we expect that we're kind of at the bottom or have seen the bottom of that cycle, you will see very strong incrementals on the way back up, the transport is a nice \u2013 very attractive margin business, and you will see strong incremental as we see that recover. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Steve Tusa : Hey guys. Good morning. David Gitlin : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : What was price realized in revenue for the company and then for HVAC in the quarter? Tim McLevish : Flattish Steve. Steve Tusa : Okay. Got it. And both for the company and HVAC? Tim McLevish : Yes. Steve Tusa : Okay. When you're kind of looking at how you kind of moved down from the increase in guidance to cash, I think you said some timing items. What were those timing items? And do you think, I assume you can grow cash next year but maybe a little bit less than revenues \u2013 less than net income because of those timing items? Tim McLevish : Yes. Most of the timing we would expect actually to play out in the fourth quarter, if you kind of use a subtractive method of where we are year-to-date in cash flow and where our guidance is for the year, you will see that the fourth quarter is not what is \u2013 what we typically would see in the fourth quarter of this year. Some of that is, the strength we had in resi and the relatively short receivables terms and the long payable terms. So you're seeing a lot of the purchases we had for that as positive cash flow in Q3, that interchange between them. We'll pay those mostly back in the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit of a bleed into the first quarter of next year. And then also somewhat COVID related and somewhat startup related, we have some tax deferrals for practical purposes. So for instance, there's $50 million, $60 million of tax on the sale of Beijer. We obviously recognize the gain in the third quarter. We will pay the tax for it in the fourth quarter. And then there was some estimates as probably another $30 million, $40 million, $50 million of tax timing. So it's really some working capital items, some tax impact. Steve Tusa : I see, the timing in the fourth quarter, right. I got it. And then just lastly, Dave, what's kind of your call on the resi market next year? Lennox has said mid singles, I think Trane said up a bit. What's kind of your view on the high level on the resi market trend here? David Gitlin : Yes. I think it feels in that sort of low, perhaps it gets up into the mid single-digit range. I think when you look at some of the underlying factors, I do think there is more demand for IAQ. We are seeing more demand for that. We'll have to obviously see, we'll see about weather, but you look at the, a lot of the underlying fundamentals that have driven the strength that we've seen now. They'll continue into next year. A new construction should continue to be strong, up mid this year, probably up mid next year. And we have good position with resi new construction. We do see that the whole state home phenomenon of people putting additions on their house for their studies or people really prioritizing spend on resi, residential air conditioning because their families are spending more time at home. I think that will certainly continue into next year. So there's going to be some compare issues, but it certainly would feel low and it may get up into the mid-range. Steve Tusa : Thanks. Tim, thanks for all the help and congrats to both of you on a pretty good start to in a very tough environment coming out as a public company for sure. So kudos to you guys on the execution. Great job. Tim McLevish : Thanks Steve. Appreciate it. David Gitlin : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning, guys. David Gitlin : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : Hey, just a couple questions on commercial service. I think you said it was down high single-digits. Just a little surprised that that's not starting to get more resilient here. So what's the outlook as you look at service going forward? And then just on the attachment rate comment, you seem encouraged, you're adding feet on the street. What do you think entitlement is for attachment rates, a couple of years out? David Gitlin : Yes, look, we had \u2013 we originally thought this year was going to be 25 and we test ourselves to get the 30, we're at 27% attachment rate. And we'll exit this year at 30. So we're getting really, really strong traction there. And our AssuranceONE program is helping that. The playbook is clear, we know what we have to do, the feet on the street, as you mentioned, will help. Look, I see that number getting up to 50% over the next few years, we just got to keep chipping away at it. I will say that a couple of our peers had a bit of a jumpstart on us with their focus on things like modernizations and attachment rates. So in all candor, we're playing a little bit of catch up, but we know what to do. We know the playbook, we have confidence in it. If you look at our overall service backlog, it's actually up about 30% because some of the orders that we've had have been pushing out to the right, when you look at some customers pushing out modernizations and some other tasks. So as we get into next year, we think that we'll see some real growth on the service side. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then just on the apply backlog, it was encouraging to hear backlog up, kind of mid singles exiting the year. What is the mix within that and just kind of within the order rates this quarter that kind of normalized or got more resilient. What are the key end markets or verticals that are kind of helping you there? David Gitlin : Yes. I was mentioning a little bit around things that are helping us. It's really \u2013 it's by location and it's by vertical. It's kind of like when you fish, you go where the fish are, right now, you go where the customers are. And they happen to be in places \u2013 in places like data centers, healthcare, warehousing, education has shown some positive trends. So those have been quite positive. Our light commercial business is down 10% to 15%, but that's very much a replacement business. 80/20 is replacement. So eventually as those start to come back, we would expect that to recover as we get into 2021. But we have seen \u2013 I'm really, really proud of the China team. They've continued to pick up share and do a very nice job. And in North America, we've seen some real traction here and some recent wins even over the last few weeks. So I feel confident that coming, even in a very challenged environment, we're continuing to get some key wins here in North America. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Appreciate the color. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good day, everyone. Hope you're doing well. David Gitlin : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Maybe two questions, one first, a little bit in the weeds on data center if we could. ALC struck an agreement with data center information management company, Nlyte, not too long ago. Maybe just a little color on what incrementally you're doing in data centers on top of kind of the core, kind of cooling play that we're all kind of thinking? David Gitlin : Yes. You look at data centers has been a big focus area for us. We've actually had a number of key wins. And when we look at data centers, it kind of plays into the Carrier story overall, which is that we have a group that sells across Carrier. It covers every one of our verticals. So it'll include ALC and complete digital solutions. It'll include, of course our HVAC systems, chillers and others, but it can include everything from our Marioff business that provides a very kind of purpose fit suppression system for things like data centers, the rest of Jurgen's portfolio on fire and security, many aspects of that play well for data centers. So when we look at our building systems group that we have that sells into verticals, we have a holistic data center solution. We do the same for things like hospitals, where we had a significant win with Emory University that we're now talking to other hospitals across the country on. So that group can really look at holistic offerings Jeff Sprague : Interesting. And then just a follow up on some of these kinds of variance items, just to be clear on the investment spend, that's $100 million incremental this year. Are we at run rate or you're suggesting that goes up to a higher level in 2021? And I \u2013 also just a kind of similar question on CapEx what kind of a variance might be into 2021 on that. Thank you. Tim McLevish : Yes. So let me start on that, so if you recall back at Investor Day, we kind of dimensionalize the investment back into the business to position it for growth was 150, 100, and then 50, and as COVID hit, it kind of changed that pacing. So we're 100 this year. Again, I said earlier, we've spent 25 to-date most of the third quarter, we're anticipating 75 in the fourth quarter. That will be the 100. In 2021, we expect another hundred. And then in 2022, we would expect to finish out that program at 100 and we'll have to see from there what further investment may make sense. So that's kind of that, and that's all baked into what we said earlier. From a CapEx standpoint, we do expect considerable still $125 million, $150 million of capital spend in the fourth quarter of this year. That also contributes to the, what you might consider a weaker cash flow in the fourth quarter. So there is considerable capital spend there. You also may recall back in Investor Day, we said we would spend 350 to 400 as kind of foundational capital expenditure in 2020. That was scaled back considerably because of the COVID. But we do expect that that will push out into 2021. So you would see that level in 2021. So there will be some cash headwind there. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. John Walsh : Hi, good morning, everyone. David Gitlin : Good morning, John. Tim McLevish : Good morning. John Walsh : Obviously, when you talked about commercial earlier, you called out U.S. and China. I'm curious about what you're seeing in Europe, especially around some of these green stimulus plans that are being announced, thinking about France in particular, where they're trying to really intact their installed base. Is that a big opportunity or is that an opportunity you see going forward? David Gitlin : It sure is. We just introduced our R32 air-cooled scroll chiller that we've seen initial early traction, but that the GWP focus is probably globally most acute in Europe. We think we have some very strong technology on the sustainability side. We continue to invest with new products coming out next year. So I think a real differentiator in Europe is going to be the focus on low GWP offerings. And we continue to lean into that, that does present an opportunity. And look, we were a little bit critical of ourselves, of our Europe performance in 2Q, we've seen some order trends recently. We'll have to see how things play out with what's happening with COVID in Europe. But I do think the team is starting to gain some traction over the last couple of months. John Walsh : But it sounds like you feel like you have the right product and the right position within the market to participate in that? David Gitlin : We do. We feel well positioned. I will tell you that we have more products on the come, we have a mag-bearing offering that's coming out next year. So we continue to invest in the technology and the portfolio. We like the products we have, but certainly innovation is going to be key as we get into next year and the year afterwards. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe just a separate question here, as we think about into next year, and you gave that kind of bridge on, on the investments a couple of times. I still get asked the question, why 300 is kind of the right number for the investments. Obviously, that's probably a much larger discussion than an earnings call, but it seems like you're taking up your savings. And so all else equal, we have an extra 100 million of drop through relative to what we were thinking before, is that right or could you actually, over time take up that investment number to kind of offset it? David Gitlin : Look, we'll have to assess the investment levels over the time. We have an LRP, we've factored in, what does it take to consistently grow in that mid single-digit reign and that's where we've come up with that investment level. And we've also consistently said that we would expect to improve ROS 50 bps a year. So we keep all that in balance in our algorithm, but I could tell you something that is very \u2013 a little bit new, but very thematic at Carrier is that we are going to grow. We are going to invest in growth and we're going to be consistent. We're not going to do a lot of fits and starts. We're going to make commitments on growth areas and we're going to stick to them. John Walsh : Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Tim McLevish : Good morning, Deane. David Gitlin : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Just want to follow up on that indoor air quality theme, and I appreciate that you all are the first to size this among the big HVAC players. And it does make sense in terms of what the opportunity is. And if you just give us the context of the 150 million orders that you called out that would \u2013 we should group that that's part of your bucket of the assessment for the healthy buildings and so forth. How does that split between equipment sales and then the recurring side of this, the BlueDiamond piece? David Gitlin : Yes, the 150 that was a pipeline. We are an active \u2013 they're not all firm orders yet. We've actually, we have a number firm orders, like I mentioned, with the OptiClean and others. And we actually have \u2013 this is something, obviously we review often and I was looking at our top 20 projects where we've been pulled into the project that I mentioned in Colorado, where through Cushman & Wakefield, we would have had a typical chiller sale, which would have been significant. But we added a number of UV lights and other kind of bipolar ionization, other kind of filtration add-ons to another wise typical order that was really quite significant. We've seen it with a university in Southeast Asia where we had a very significant dedicated IAQ sale where they were very focused on is they were welcoming students back. So look, some are firm order. Some are, I think, soon to be converted into firm orders. And it really has been primarily on the HVAC side, but Jurgen and his team have some really creative offerings. The BlueDiamond piece is going to be part of our overall digital solution because that's the piece that can have that customer intimacy, where you can look at your smartphone and you can use that to, excuse me, see how are the actual indicators for IAQ, whether it's your CO2 levels or your \u2013 the amount of ventilation that you're seeing, or other things that you may be measuring. We were looking at about seven attributes that we'll be looking at. And BlueDiamond will be a great source for us to kind of monitor those seven attributes and also give the end customer insight into those attributes. BlueDiamond also gives you capabilities around contact tracing. We have the announcement that Jurgen and team drove with FLIR around thermal scanning. So there's a number of things in his portfolio that are attractive, but become a lot more attractive when they're part of the Carrier Solution. Deane Dray : Terrific. And look, I know we're at the top of the hour, but I did just want to squeeze in one last question. Your HVAC peers all are scanned favorable within the ESG community in terms of holdings, you all are new \u2013 as a new public company, you really haven't cracked the top 10 yet. Would be interested in how you expect to position Carrier for this ESG demand that we expect is will be interested in the stock. But what has to happen before you'll start seeing the ESG and sustainability investors considering Carrier? David Gitlin : Yes, Deane, I'm glad you ended on that question because we're very energized about ESG and we just reviewed with our board, our specific targets that we will be committing ourselves to, and we'll be releasing publicly. Obviously, it's going to be a big focus on sustainability. And I think folks will be quite pleased by how we're stepping up around our sustainability targets. But it includes everything from D&I where I'm \u2013 really believe that we've leaned into the moment around diversity and inclusion. And that's just the profound impact that that's had on us this year, that's going to be sustainable. In all other aspects of D&I, how we deal with our suppliers and various elements in our own operations. So I think this will be very, very thematic for Carrier, it's thematic for our space, but we're really looking to differentiate ourselves. And I think you would expect us to be within the top quartile on an ESG basis. Deane Dray : Great to hear, Thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dave Gitlin for any closing remarks. David Gitlin : Okay. Well, thank you. And thank you all for participating. Sam is around of course, the rest of the day and beyond for any questions. Thank you all. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being carried live on the internet, and there is a presentation available to download from Carrier's website at ir.Carrier.com. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With me here today are David Gitlin, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. Except as otherwise noted, the company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-recurring and/or nonoperational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items.  The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. This morning, we\u2019ll review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020, discuss the full year 2021 outlook, and will leave time for questions at the end. Once the call is opened up for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to give everyone the opportunity to participate. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Okay. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide a quick summary of our fourth quarter performance on Slide 2, and Patrick will provide more color. In short, no surprises. Sales were up 2% on a reported basis, flat organically, as residential HVAC remained very strong, with a 25% year-over-year increase. We produced $453 million of adjusted operating profit, executing on the cost actions that we planned and communicated, including accelerated growth investment, incremental public company costs, and some one-time items that Patrick will cover. And we are very pleased with our free cash flow generation in the quarter. Excluding the Beijer tax payment of $272 million, we would have exceeded our forecast by about $100 million. Importantly, we continued to consistently execute on our long-term strategic growth agenda, while maintaining strong traction on our Carrier 700 and G&A cost reduction initiatives. All of this positions us well for 2021 and beyond. Turning to Slide 3, before we dive into 2021, let me provide a broader look back at 2020. I look at 2020 as both a foundational and a transformational year for Carrier. With the spin from UTC, it was clear that we had a unique opportunity to create tremendous value, but to do so, we needed to create a new Carrier. We started with our culture, and took an intentional and deliberate approach to launching the Carrier Way. Our culture reinforces our value, and is centered around customers, agility, innovation, talent, and winning, and the energy level within Carrier is tremendous. In addition to culture, we have invested in and promoted existing employees, while infusing the team with key outside talent, who have brought fresh perspectives and proven leadership. We also launched several new initiatives designed to further enhance the agility and effectiveness of our organization. For example, we launched Carrier Excellence, our new operating system, Carrier Alliance, our new supply chain program, and we undertook a holistic and structural approach to driving sustained G&A reductions and simplicity across the business. We put a disciplined process in place to drive $600 million of recurring cost savings over three years, Carrier 600. And given our strong progress, we recently increased our target to $700 million under the renamed Carrier 700.  We also dramatically improved the balance sheets and spend. We now have increased financial flexibility to invest in growth, execute both on M&A, and return capital to shareholders. In December, we announced a 50% increase in the dividend. And today, we announced a share repurchase program. And we leaned in to becoming ESG leaders, committing to significant, achievable, and important goals, such as, by 2030, reducing our customers carbon footprint by more than one gigaton, and achieving carbon neutrality in our operations, commitments that are not only good for the environment, but also good for business. We also made progress on our profile commitment to improving our diversity representation, and creating a truly inclusive culture. And we reframed our focus to position Carrier as a growth company. While the COVID pandemic in 2020 presented unprecedented challenges, it also served to reinforce our position as the world leader in healthy, safe, and sustainable building and cold chain solutions. With this as our enterprise strategy, supplemented by our three-pillar approach to driving sustained growth, we are confident in our topline opportunities for 2021 and beyond. Slide 4 shows the flywheel that I used in our last earnings call to help explain how our key focus areas, will drive shareholder value. As COVID shined a light on the criticality of healthy, safe, and sustainable buildings and cold chains, we acted on our ambition to become a world leader in both. There has been a tectonic shift in how business, government, and society value the safety of indoor environments, and the importance of robust systems for distributing food and medicine. There has also been a groundswell of recent focus on sustainability, all of which represent opportunities for Carrier's business now and in the future. On the building side, we introduced new products like our OptiClean unit that Time Magazine recognized as a top innovation of 2020. More recently, as part of our healthy home strategy, we introduced an air purifier for the home. This is our first direct to consumer product focused on improving air quality. And we also are now selling Carrier one-inch filters directly to consumers. Overall, we have over $100 million of orders for healthy building products and services, and have a pipeline of more than $200 million. The next milestone is the release of a new digital solution that we're calling Abound that will work with building management systems to provide visibility to indoor air quality and other key healthy building indicators. Using machine learning, this solution will connect to building control systems and auto mitigate deficiencies. The overall goal is to work with our customers to give their patrons and tenants confidence to reenter indoor environments. As an example, we recently signed a sponsorship with the American Hotel and Lodging Association, where Carrier will help define the AHLA Safe Stay guidelines for guests and staff around indoor air quality and contactless solutions. And then we'll play our part to help hotels implement those solutions. On the refrigeration side, we continue to see traction on connected cold chain offerings that address the critical challenges inherent to food and pharmaceutical distribution. Sales at our industry-leading cargo monitoring Sensitech business, were up about 10% in the fourth quarter, and we entered 2021 with a backlog that is up over 170% over the same period last year. And we continue to push for adoption of our cloud-based Lynx platform that we are co-developing with AWS to extend our current digital offerings. Our growth levers are further fueled by delivering against our three strategic pillars. First, in terms of growing the core, we can say with confidence that we gained share in many of our core markets. We met our objective of adding over 500 sales and sales support people, invested over $400 million in R&D, enabling us to introduce over 120 new products last year. We continue to have key new wins. Our team never needed to be pushed to win, just given the freedom and the investments needed to get back to our market-leading roots. We also continued to push product extensions, such as VRF and geographic coverage, with a focus on increasing sales in China. Our third pillar, growing services in digital, has yielded very strong initial results, as we push our business models to focus more on recurring revenues. To kick start progress, we focused last year on our conversion rates. That is, converting new OEM units coming off warranty to long-term agreements. We started the year at 20% conversion rates. We committed to end the year at 30%, and we did. Going forward, our focus will be on overall coverage. That is, of our overall installed base of chillers in the market, how many of those are under some sort of long-term agreement? Today, we have coverage of about 50,000 units, and our plan is to increase that by about 10,000 units per year. We have similar objectives in other parts of our business as well.  Increased coverage is enabled by digital solutions. Our truck trailer segment launched eSolutions 2.0, with a web-based dashboard that provides critical fleet information, enhanced visibility, and improved geo-fencing. And in F&S, we launched our Edwards EST4 network, fire alarm, and emergency communications platform, to tie multiple remote buildings together, to provide more flexibility and cost-effective solutions to our customers. We also continued to invest in and grow our ALC building automation and controls business, where customers have embraced our open architecture solutions. 50% of our 2020 sales in that business came from recently introduced products, and we are complementing that with continued investments in our channel and field network. From its culture and our growth mindset, we are taking a very disciplined approach to capital allocation. In the span of just nine months, we reduced our net debt from about $10 billion to approximately $7 billion, and ended the year with over $3 billion of cash. Our balance sheet improvement now opens the door to bolt-on M&A. our acquisitions will align with our focus on healthy, safe, and sustainable building and cold chain solutions, and more broadly with the three pillars of growth that we have laid out.  Before I turn it over to Patrick, let me give you some color on how we're thinking about 2021 on Slide 5. Our outlook for the year reflects our objective of being a consistent, mid-single digit organic growth company. We expect sales to grow 6% to 8%, and that includes 2% tailwind from FX. And with strong conversion, we expect adjusted EPS to increase by about 14% at the midpoint. We\u2019ll continue to invest in growth, while we project improving margins by about 70 basis points, and producing strong free cash flow of about $1.6 billion.  While we are starting this year with continued uncertainty around the global economic recovery as the pandemic continues to impact people and economies around the world, we are optimistic that the uncertainty will subside as we get into the second half of the year, following more widespread vaccine distribution. The good news for our first half is that our backlog is solid, given the strength in orders in 4Q that has continued very well into January. As we get into the second half of the year, we expect some of the businesses that were acutely challenged by the pandemic to start to recover, particularly in retail, hospitality, and small to medium-sized businesses.  So with that, let me now turn it over to Patrick. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Good to be with you on the call today, and very excited to be part of the Carrier team. I've spent the last two months gaining a deeper understanding of our strengths and the opportunities we have in front of us. I see tremendous opportunities to create value, given our focus on innovation, accelerating profitable growth, driving internal efficiencies, free cash flow generation, and capital deployment and portfolio management. I will sharpen this focus and drive execution so we can continue to deliver long-term superior financial returns to shareowners. Let me share some detail around the quarter. Please turn to Slide 6. As Dave discussed, Q4 was broadly in line with our outlook. As you can see on the right side, we exceeded the outlook we gave you an October for sales and adjusted operating profit. Sales of $4.6 billion were up 2% versus the prior year, and flat organically. Currency was a two point tailwind for sales in the quarter, about $100 million, but with little profit contribution. The sales growth was driven by continued strength in our residential HVAC business, which was up 25% in the quarter. We saw continued sequential improvement across our other businesses. As expected, adjusted operating profit of $453 million, was down versus the prior year, as Carrier 700 cost savings were more than offset by the reversal of some temporary costs actions related to COVID-19, the expected $75 million of investments, about $25 million of incremental public company costs, and about $50 million of one-time items in the quarter. These one-time items were about $20 million higher than we expected, and included a pre-spin vendor contract termination, and legal and related costs. Free cash flow of $38 million in the quarter, included $272 million in tax payments related to the sale of the Beijer shares. We anticipated $50 million to $60 million of that from the September sale, but the remainder associated with the December transaction, was not captured in our October outlook. Moving on to the full year. Sales of $17.45 billion, were above our most recent outlook of about $17.3 billion, due to currency translation. Full year adjusted operating profit was $2.23 billion, just over our October guidance. And excluding the tax payments for the sale of Beijer shares, we would have exceeded our free cash flow targets by about $100 million.  Let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on Slide 7. HVAC organic sales were up 4% in the quarter, driven by the 25% increase in residential. As expected, field inventory levels have now normalized, and we should see more typical growth trends in that business going forward, but recognize there will be a much easier compare in the first half versus the second half of 2021.  Commercial HVAC sales were down mid-single digits organically. Light commercial was down 10% and continued to lag, but the rate of decline improved sequentially. Turning to refrigeration. Sales of $949 million were down 3% on an organic basis, but improved sequentially. This was by far the best quarter from a year-over-year perspective for this segment. Organic sales of the fire and security segment, also continued to improve sequentially in Q4, and were down 5% compared to last year. We saw a 6% decline in the products business, and a 2% decrease in the field business. Within the product businesses, which represents about 60% of the segment sales, residential and commercial fire continued to be solid, while access solutions in our industrial businesses remained challenging. Now, let me review the order activity we saw in the fourth quarter, because that is important to understand what is driving our 2021 outlook. As you can see on Slide 8, our residential and light commercial businesses continued to see strong orders, driven by residential. We intentionally worked with our channel partners to exit 2020 with more normalized inventory levels. Backlog in residential is up almost threefold compared to a year ago, and puts us in a solid position for shipments in the first half of 2021. Commercial HVAC orders were about flat compared to last year, and we exited 2020 with backlog up mid-teens year-over-year. For refrigeration, order activity for the truck trailer business continued to improve sequentially. North American truck trailer orders were up well over 100% in the quarter, and Europe was up about 10%. Container orders up almost 50%, pointing to a recovery in 2021. Commercial refrigeration orders were up mid-teens organically, as the business is also seeing pent-up demand. Strong order intake and backlogs exiting the year, positioned the refrigeration segment for the strongest growth of the three segments in 2021. Order intake for our fire and security segment also continued to improve sequentially. Product orders were down low single digits. Like prior quarters, industrial end markets and global access solutions, remain weak. Field orders were up low double-digits year-over-year, and we exited 2020 with record backlog for installations in this business. Overall, a generally improving order trend gives us confidence in our ability to deliver solid growth in 2021.  Please turn to Slide 9, as I walk you through our 2021 outlook. Based on current exchange rates, we expect reported sales to be up 6% to 8%. We expect organic growth of 4% to 6%, and a currency translation tailwind of about 2%. We expect HVAC and fire and security organic growth to be low to mid-single digits, and expect refrigeration to be up low teens. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand by about 70 basis points at the midpoint to around 13.5%. We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 25%, one point lower than last year. And adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.85 and $1.95. This represents about 14% EPS growth at the midpoint. We expect about $1.6 billion in free cash flow, which represents about 95% conversion, despite higher capital spending, and about $100 million more in interest payments.  Moving to slide 10, let's walk through the pieces in our 2021 adjusted EPS bridge. Adjusted EPS growth will come almost entirely from operational performance, as the increased volume converts to earnings. Core earnings conversion, which excludes the impact of currency, the 2020 Beijer sale, and the 2020 Q4 items, is about 30%. We anticipate additional benefits from Carrier 700 of about $225 million in 2021, and expect the absence of COVID related inefficiencies and disruptions in our factories and supply chain, to benefit us by about $125 million. Offsetting that is about $200 million of cost containment snapback, and about $150 million of planned incremental investments.  We previously talked about the three-year plan as $100 million of investment in each year of 2020, 2021, and 2022. We are accelerating some investments into 2021. And therefore, currently expect incremental investments in 2022 to be only $50 million. We expect the net impact of pricing and input costs to be neutral for the year. Interest expense will be a headwind in 2021. We raised most of the debt in late February 2020, so we did not have an entire year's worth of interest expense last year.  Lastly, we currently have some restrictions in our debt covenants on the total number of shares we can repurchase. And so, while we target repurchasing about 5 million shares in 2021, the average number of shares used for EPS in 2021 will still be above 2020. And so, that represents about a $0.02 headwind \u201821 versus \u201920. Page 16 of the slide deck includes some additional items related to our 2021 outlook.  Let's shift focus to the balance sheet and our leverage profile on Slide 11. Carrier completed the spin in April, with substantial leverage. Since that time, we've been able to reduce leverage significantly through strong free cash flow performance and the sale of our stake in Beijer. We repaid the entire $1.75 billion term loan in the fourth quarter, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved from about 3.4 at the time of the spin, down to about 2.8 at the end of fiscal 2020. We expect 2021 year end\u2019s net debt just north of $6 billion, which would bring our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio closer to 2.1 by the end of 2021, that is assuming no impact from potential acquisitions or divestitures. The bottom line is that we're in a much stronger position today, given the improved health of our balance sheet, which provides more flexibility with respect to capital deployment.  That takes us to Slide 12. During 2020, it was clear that the focus had to be on reducing leverage. As we enter 2021, we plan a more balanced capital deployment, while remaining within our overall capital structure of an investment grade credit rating. We expect 2021 CapEx to be about $375 million. Dave talked about some of our priorities with respect to inorganic investments. We're not putting a dollar amount placeholder here, but we will be opportunistic on bolt-on M&A that help achieve our strategic objectives and meet our financial criteria. We plan to reduce debt by $500 million in 2021. And in light of our pending redemption, we will not have any debt maturing until 2025. In December, we announced a dividend increase, and we now expect 2021 dividend payments to amount to about $425 million. And today, the Board authorized a share repurchase program of $350 million, and our outlook for \u201821 incorporates repurchasing about 5 million shares this year. Before I turn it back to Dave, let me just add that the volatile quarters in 2020, should lead to some unusual comparisons in 2021. We expect strong double-digit organic growth in the first half of 2021, and closer to flat organic performance in the second half, given the residential comparisons. In addition, we expect the first quarter to have the lowest incremental margins for the year, probably in the high teens, due to having more Beijer income in last year's Q1 than other quarters, a larger currency conversion headwind, and some prior year deferred comp favorable items. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave. David Gitlin : Okay. Thank you, Patrick. Our results demonstrate that we successfully navigated through 2020. We remain focused on driving key strategic growth initiatives, alongside aggressive cost actions that will fuel future investment and innovation. Our balance sheet improvement provides additional flexibility to create shareholder value through bolt-on M&A, dividends, and share buyback. All of these factors, combined with the tailwinds from important megatrends, position us well for strong top and bottom line growth in 2021 and beyond.  So with that, we'll open this up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question. Stephen Volkmann : Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I'm hoping you can just talk a little bit more about the commercial HVAC business. Obviously strong backlog headed into \u201921, but orders kind of flattish. Maybe you can give us a little bit more color, either by market or by type of product, or anything that - to sort of give us a sense of the cadence on commercial HVAC. Thank you. David Gitlin : Yes. Good morning, Steve. Yes, we are pleased with the backlog being up in the mid-teens, but clearly, there are some watch items there. The ABI, being at about 43 in December, has been below 50 since April. So we have a watch on it. Remember that commercial new construction is about 15% of our overall business. The things that give us a lot of confidence are, some verticals remain very strong globally, data centers, warehouses, education, healthcare, have all been strong. Number two is, we are seeing traction in our whole focus on indoor air quality, healthy buildings. We have a pipeline of $200 million there. So it's clearly a watch item, particularly North America.  I was pleased. China has continued to be strong. Europe, we actually saw coming back. You may recall earlier in 2020, I felt like we weren't gaining the share in Europe that we had been in North America, China. The team made a number of changes in Europe, and we're seeing traction there. So, signs of life in Europe. Orders were up about 5% there in the fourth quarter. Asia Pacific actually showing a bit of strength towards the end of last year for the first time in eight or nine months. So signs of progress, but clearly a couple of watch items, probably the biggest being North American new construction. Stephen Volkmann : Great. that's helpful. And do you feel like people are able to get out into the field now and do more of the kind of service maintenance, upgrade stuff that is probably - sort of represents pent up demand for 21, or is that still on the com? David Gitlin : No, we do. The good news for the aftermarket is that we actually come in - HVAC services backlog ended the year up about 20%. So we are seeing people get out there, even in Europe where it's a bit spotty and some markets are more closed than others. Even though they've been distributing the vaccine in England, we still see some pockets of closed down locations there. Same with Germany. But by and large, we are getting our field support and our technicians out into buildings, certainly in the United States. So, we're looking at double-digit HVAC aftermarket growth in 2020, and it'll be fueled by folks getting back into the buildings. Stephen Volkmann : Super. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Hey, can you guys maybe provide a little bit more color around the $50 million charge that you took this quarter, and then whether all of came through on HVAC margins this quarter? Patrick Goris : Yes, Joe, Patrick here. So really one big item, as part of those one-time items is, as I mentioned, a vendor contract renegotiation. Think of it as a pre-spin contract that we had from another UTC umbrella. We think we can do better than that specific contract. So we decided to terminate it. There were costs associated with that that we incurred in the quarter. We'll benefit from that in future years, and the NPV obviously was positive on that transaction. That was by far the biggest item within the $50 million. And I would say that clearly HVAC had the biggest part of that one-time cost of about $50 million in the quarter. So clearly, HVAC margins were impacted by that more than the other segments. Joe Ritchie : Okay. That's helpful, Patrick. And maybe my just - my one follow-up, maybe just sticking with HVAC margins. I think that was probably the area where we're hearing the most from investors today. Can you guys just kind of parse out what really kind of happened within the quarter outside of this one contract, because margins still would have been down outside of - you've seen growth in the quarter? And I recognize that you spent about $75 million in investment. But maybe just kind of parse out what were kind of the key drivers for the margins in HVAC this quarter? Patrick Goris : Sure. So within HVAC, currency helped us. Currency translation was a tailwind on sales of about $40 million. So basically with no operating profits to the contribution. We did see a benefit of the higher volume, particularly in Resi, which was up 25%. Mix was actually a headwind in the quarter, and actually that relates to commercial HVAC. The applied equipment piece of commercial HVAC returned to growth. We saw that up low single digits, which is a good thing. We saw good growth in China.  We have not yet seen service in aftermarkets return to growth. Service in aftermarket was down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. They tend to have better margins. Now, the good thing is, backlog for service in aftermarket was up double-digits for us in the quarter. So that bodes well for future periods. Other items that impacted the HVAC margins in the quarter, one, you referred to investments. Investments were up $75 million in the quarter for the overall company. HVAC saw the vast majority of that. And so that, together with the one-timers that I referred to earlier, is really the story around HVAC margins. For next year, we expect for the full year, HVAC margins to be close to 16%. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. And Patrick, good to hear your voice again. (Indiscernible), but here we are. So I think you just kind of addressed the HVAC margin issue quite well, but when you say the vast majority of the investment spending, are we talking about like over 50 of that 75 would have been within that segment? Just trying to size the impact of that investment spend. Patrick Goris : Yes. North of 50 million would have impacted the spend, Nigel. Nigel Coe : And then the nature of this investment spending, is it primarily headcount spending? And I'm wondering if the (K full) of that 150, if it's mainly just the analyzation of what is being spent in the second half of this year. David Gitlin : Yes. Nigel - good morning, Nigel. It's Dave. Yes. Recall that we really look at our investments in three categories. We said that we'd add - the first is selling and salespeople. We said we'd add 500 sales and sales support people last year. We ended up adding more like 550. And a lot of that, we started to see in the fourth quarter. We also invested in R&D. that was a big chunk of it. We had tapped the brakes a little bit on some of our investments in 2Q. We started to release it in 3Q into 4Q. So we did accelerate R&D investments.  And also the third piece is digital, a little bit less than the R&D side, but we're going to come out with some new digital products here at the beginning of the second quarter, especially tied into healthy building. So we really tried to lean forward because that's what we see as one of the most transformational opportunities, has to be - has to do with a digital offering that's going to be an extraction layer that has - that gives customers visibility into things like indoor air quality. So we really accelerated some of our investments there in the fourth quarter. Patrick Goris : And then Nigel, of the 150 million, about half of it would be carryover from investments made late in 2020. Nigel Coe : Thank you. One question from sort of the attach initiative, you\u2019re (indiscernible) increasing in the install base of chillers being serviced. What is driving that uptake? What are you doing differently today than you weren\u2019t doing this time last year? And then secondly, as part of that, would you be pointing towards double-digit service growth going forward? David Gitlin : Well, certainly, we feel positive about double-digit service growth in \u201821. And we'll have to see as we get into \u201822 and beyond, but you look at that - we have a relatively small percentage of our say chillers under some form of long-term agreement. It's less than 25%. And the reality is, it should be something that's exponentially higher. One of the ways to do it is having those chillers be connected. So we're going out of our way to add edge devices to the chiller so we could have more of a two-way communication with the customer. So we can not only do things like diagnostics and prognosis - diagnostics and prognostics, but other value-added services, such as energy efficiency through making the devices connected.  So connecting the devices is one. Adding the salespeople is another key one. One of the reasons we were successful in our conversion rates last year, was simply putting people in the building, working with the building operator to say, while it's under warranty, or while it's under an agreement with someone else, there's value-added services that we can provide. So increasing our sales forces in a very targeted way, so for example, in China, at some of the tier two cities, in the North America at some of the underserved regions that we have today. So really it's a lot of blocking and tackling. I am very confident in the double-digit aftermarket growth this year. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. You may proceed with your question. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you could address a little bit more of what you're expecting on the price cost side. Was it an issue in the quarter? You did go through a lot of the margin dynamics in Q4, but I don't think you mentioned price costs. But more importantly, as you look forward into 2021, what do you see and what do you have modeled? Patrick Goris : Yes, Jeff. For 2020, price realization was really about flat. Our lead for \u201821, we\u2019re very closely monitoring commodity prices, especially steel, copper, aluminum. We expect price to offset commodity inflation in 2021. We announced our price increase during the normal cycle, which is early in our first quarter. And then from a blocking or locking point of view, currently over 75% of our 2021 requirements are locked or blocked. If prices stay high, of course this could be a watch out in for 2022, but we'll be continuing to look at this closely and looking, of course, at continued recovery through pricing as well. So overall, neutral for fiscal \u201821. Jeff Sprague : And I'm also just wondering kind of new core independent Carrier. You provided in the appendix kind of the outlook on corporate expense and the like. Are we largely at run rate, though, coming out of Q4 on public company costs, anything that's left over on TSAs, that sort of thing? Maybe you could just address what, if any, kind of nuances or headwinds we should be thinking about as you kind of get into your full - first full independent year here. Patrick Goris : Yes. Jeff, I think this will be de minimis in fiscal 2021. There might be a little bit in the first quarter, but really not a big number for the full year. David Gitlin : And I would add, Jeff, that look, we've been clear that our G&A is just too high. So, it's - we have a very structured focus around taking G&A out. It's not something that you can kind of do the right way overnight. What we're trying to do, rather than just give kind of headcount targets or things like that, we're trying to make structural changes. We have a leader that reports to me, Eva Azoulay, who's leading a whole low cost center of excellence approach. We're outsourcing some aspects. We\u2019re moving some of the work to low cost COEs, and we're really trying to reduce our G&A in a structured way. \u201821 is a lot of putting that in place. So we'll start to see a lot of the benefit of it as we get into \u201822 and beyond. So our G&A should come down for sure. And $100 million of the Carrier 700 is G&A. So we expect to start seeing that drop through, certainly as we get into \u201822. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. You may have proceed your questions. Steve Tusa : Hey, good morning. Can you just clarify what the raw material impact is, just so we have an idea of what those two components are? Just following up on Jeff's question. Patrick Goris : Oh, for the full year? Steve Tusa : Yes. Patrick Goris : Yes. We see a headwind of several tens of millions of dollars. Steve Tusa : Okay. Got it. And then what did Carrier\u2019s 700 ultimately come in at for the year on the benefits side? Patrick Goris : Carrier 700 came in at 250 in fiscal \u201820. We expect \u201821 to be about 225. Steve Tusa : Okay. Got it. And then just one more on resi. You said your backlog was up like 3x. Is there any buy-in there ahead of those price increases that's influencing that number? I mean, that just seems like a pretty big number for December - the year-end, December 31st. David Gitlin : Yes. Certainly, we were pleased with backlog coming in 3x higher than it was at the same time last year, Steve. What we've really worked very purposefully on with our distributors, is to make sure that we were trying to match our flow to them with their movements at the dealer base. So, as Patrick said, we had sales in the fourth quarter up 25%. Movement from the distributors into the dealers was about 20%. Inventory was up around 10% coming out of last year into this year. So fairly normalized.  We saw order strength continue to be very, very strong in January. Now, part of it is that you know that we have a good position with new home construction. That was up about 8% last year. We expect it to continue to be strong this year, but we're working very closely with our channel partners to make sure that we're giving them what they need when they need it. And there's just a lot of demand in the system, but we're trying to modulate that to make sure we're there to support them so they can support the dealer network. Steve Tusa : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning, guys. So Slide 10, great color on the different moving pieces in costs. Just wondering how you think of cadence for investments. And you gave good color on incrementals on 1Q, just how some of those moving pieces impact kind of cadence and incrementals as you kind of move through the year. Patrick Goris : Yes. Jeff, I think from an investment point of view, you can expect that to be fairly even throughout the year in 2021. From a incremental point of view, as I mentioned, Q1, a little weaker than the other quarters. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then just on kind of the first half, second half, I understand - I mean, I guess that things have been - were improving through 2020, but outside of residential being so strong in the second half, where else do you see \u201ctough comps\u201d to kind of get you to that flat dynamic in the second half? Patrick Goris : I think it's really driven by residential in the second half. So obviously we had a very strong resi second half in 2020, with very high growth rates. As we lap these, some of those headwinds get partial - get offset by what we expect to be a pickup in light commercial, commercial HVAC in our fire and security business. And so, that's really the - what we're counting on in the second half of the year, there is a recovery related to COVID that helps offset some of those headwinds in resi. David Gitlin : Yes. Jeff, I\u2019d add that I think we really view this as a tale of two halves. You look at the first half, we're coming in with very strong backlogs. Orders, Patrick mentioned, were up 15% in the fourth quarter. Some were quite high, like in our transport refrigeration business, very strong there. So we like our opening backlog position. Orders continued to be very strong in January almost across the portfolio. So we expect that the backlog in orders to carry us through the first half. Clearly you have the compares, but as you get into the second half, there's pent up demand in some of the key verticals that have been acutely challenged.  So, our light commercial business, we start - we would expect to see recovery as we get into the second half of this year. You start looking at some parts of our fire and security business that were hurt by small and medium sized businesses and the impact of retail and some of the big box retail impacts that we've seen. So we expect that first half carry through with backlog, second half as economy starts to reopen and there's some pent up demand, we expect that to give us some lift in the second half. Tough compares, but progress in some acutely impacted verticals. Jeff Hammond : Okay. If I could sneak one more in, just selling versus sell-through, your sense for residential as you look at your independents, or just kind of what your distributors are telling you, what sell-through was in 4Q. David Gitlin : Well, we looked at - we were looking at 20% movement in 4Q from our distributors into the dealer. So we were trying very hard to really match our sell in and sell out. It was a little bit higher on what we sold to them than what they moved out, but not materially. So there is significant demand in the channel. I would say that one thing that is positive is that we have gained share. It's always complicated when you look at share on a quarter-to-quarter basis with all the different moving parts on selling, either direct to dealers or selling through independent distribution.  But if you just step back and look at 2020 as a whole, our resi sales were up 10%, and you're looking at probably a market that was up 7% to 8%. So we feel positive that we're gaining share the right way. Our partnership with our distribution partners has been very positive. New construction is - new home construction has been positive. So, we feel positive about where we are and where we're going on Resi. And we're trying to be very careful to not get out over our skis, ourselves or our distribution partners. Jeff Hammond : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And Dave, congrats on being named Chairman. David Gitlin : Thank you, Deane. Appreciate that. Deane Dray : First question for Patrick. You don't often hear about covenants that restrict buybacks. I know it does happen, but the expectation, if you're going to be at 2.1 net leverage by year end, you would think those covenants would not be in play and maybe they can get rolled back. I know you negotiated covenants last year. Might this be an opportunity as well? Patrick Goris : Yes. Under our current covenants, we have those restrictions and those remain there until the end of the year. We could decide to renegotiate them. The other factor that's at play here is that our current capital structure, we're kind of growing into our existing credit ratings. And so by the end of the year, our capital structure will be much more aligned with our existing credit rating. And so, this would not be the time to buy back significantly more shares, as we're trying - as we\u2019re still working our way into our existing credit rating. And so that's the other element that's at play here, Deane. We could renegotiate it, but there's still the credit rating that's in play as well. And it's clearly our intention to remain a solid credit rated company. Deane Dray : Appreciate that. And just, if you could expand on the opportunities in bolt-on M&A. it's interesting, the covenants don't restrict that, it would appear. Just what's the funnel look like, especially like across the product lines? David Gitlin : Deane, we're in the process of building up that pipeline. We\u2019ve had some that we've been working. We\u2019re adding more to the pipeline. So it's something that as we continue to look at the portfolio, there's still some things that we would say that we're assessing whether or not they would be of more value in the hands of others. And then we look at our overall strategic priorities, healthy, safe, and sustainable buildings, is a big ecosystem, the cold chains and other ecosystem, our three pillars of growth. We want to grow the core. We want to look at adjacencies. We\u2019re underrepresented in China. We\u2019re underrepresented in BRF. So those are areas. And anything that builds out our services in aftermarket offerings as we continue to shift to recurring revenue. So we have some things in the pipeline that we've been working. We're trying to add to that pipeline as we go. Deane Dray : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. You may proceed with your question. Vlad, your line is on mute. Please unmute. Vlad Bystricky : Hi. Good morning, guys. Sorry about that. So, lots of great color on the quarter as always. One thing that was a little surprising is, looking at the order trends, it looks like APAC, outside of China, was actually stronger than China in terms of orders. Can you talk about what drove that strength in APAC outside of China, and how you're thinking about the sustainability of the strong order growth in the APAC region? Patrick Goris : Yes. I would say that the whole Southeast Asia is still fragile. I mean, it actually caught us a bit by surprise because it had been quite negative in the second and third quarter. Even places like India, we started to see traction. Other places, Singapore, Australia. Hong Kong is still a mixed bag because of a multitude of reasons there. But we were pleasantly surprised by some of the traction we started to see in parts of Asia outside of China. And look, China has just remained just continuously strong, really across the portfolio, on the cold chain side, both in commercial refrigeration and transport refrigeration.  Overall, look at Carrier, our China - in the fourth quarter, China sales were up 10%. Orders were up about 5% in China. Particularly strong in refrigeration, where it was up about 20%. So we remain very, very bullish on China overall, and it was nice to see progress in Southeast Asia, but it's still a watch item. We\u2019ve got to see more vaccine distribution in places like India, and then we'll get more confidence on the sustainability. Vlad Bystricky : Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just thinking about the \u201821 free cash flow outlook, can you just maybe help to level set us in terms of how you're thinking about the seasonality of free cash flow in 2021? Patrick Goris : Yes. Vlad, we would expect - and which is typical for our business, that the first quarter would be our weakest quarter of free cash flow. And that the second half would generally be stronger than the first half. So generally Q1, we\u2019d expect to be our lowest quarter of free cash flow, followed by stronger quarters and a significantly stronger second half than the first half. And that's, of course, related to some of the seasonality in our business, especially in HVAC. Vlad Bystricky : Right. Some more typical seasonality than we normally see. Patrick Goris : Correct. Vlad Bystricky : That's helpful. Thanks. I'll get back in queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe I'm just trying to hone in a little bit on the Q1 context, and understand that in general, this year's seasonality may be a little bit different, at least on earnings, if not cash flow, than normal. So any extra color on that. But if I start with Q1, you'd mentioned the high teens incremental. That compares with, I guess, the full year guide of more like 25%. For revenues in Q1, should we be thinking that sort of up high single digit, and so you end up with about 50 bps of margin expansion against 70 bps for the year as a whole? Is that roughly the right framework? David Gitlin : Yes, we do expect double-digit organic growth in the first quarter, and we do expect margin expansion as well in the first quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, we think that the timing of the investments is pretty even throughout the year. Patrick Goris : And also, Julian, again, because of the strong Q4 orders that continued into January, our coverage for Q1 is solid. So we feel positive about that. Julian Mitchell : Thank you very much. And then just thinking about the free cash flow guide for the year as a whole, understood the context on seasonality that you just provided, Patrick, but for the year as a whole, if I back out the Beijer tax payments, it looks like you're guiding for around flattish operating cash flow year-on-year in \u201821. Just wondered about any moving parts within that. You have that $100 million interest expense, I think, called out. Maybe help us understand what you're dialing in for the working capital scale of headwind. Patrick Goris : Yes. Actually, so for the full year, free cash flow, we expect it to be about flat year-over-year. Obviously, adjusted net income is expect to be up year-over-year. That's a tailwind there. There are two items that are large offsets. You mentioned one of them. Interest table is - we will make an extra $100 million of interest payments. And in CapEx, we expect also to be up about $65 million. And so that offsets most of the adjusted net income. We do expect working capital overall to be a slight tailwind. On the headwinds associated with free cash flow, we expect comp and benefits to be a little bit of a headwind there in fiscal \u201921. So those are the biggest pieces. It's really higher adjusted income, offset by $100 million extra interest payment, and $65 million additional CapEx. And then some minor items to make it flat year-over-year. Thanks, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. You may proceed with your question. Daniel Flick : Yes. Hi, guys. This is Dan on for Gautam. Thanks for the question. Could you discuss how you see permanent restaurant and brick-and-mortar closures impacting the near term versus longer term fire and security demand? If that has any impact on your long-term view of that business. Thank you. David Gitlin : Yes. I look at it. The - it impacted (indiscernible) as we start to see some of the brick-and-mortar. We saw very strong e-commerce sales in our residential smoke detector business, but we did see an impact on more of the brick-and-mortar piece of that business. So we are expecting, with the vaccine distribution, some recovery there as we get into the latter part of 2021. Another piece of the business is some of the security portfolio that some of that piece of that business is tied a little bit to - more towards SMB and small and medium sized businesses. So if you take our S2 business, for example, we start - we would expect to see that to start open up with pent up demand with the SMB side of the business as we get into the second half of the year. Daniel Flick : Okay. So you would expect the pent up demand aspect to be stronger than say, like - I don't know, what do they say, like one third of restaurants may have closed permanently now? David Gitlin : Yes. I mean, I think, look, the restaurant closures, I mean, it's something that we watch, not only for our fire and security business, but our light commercial business. We look at that business. That was down 10% in the fourth quarter, and we have that business up mid-single digits this year. So we do - clearly there's been a big impact on that whole industry, but we do expect to see some pent up demand as people start to reenter society in the second half of the year. Daniel Flick : Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. I think first question on service versus equipment in commercial. I think, maybe relative to some of your peers out there, those folks were a little bit more sanguine on service and saw equipment kind of lagging behind. You seem to have a bit of the opposite experience, but I know you're still sort of working your way up the curve on service market share. Is there something about either the timing of being able to actually schedule that, or the nature of the service you guys are winning that would suggest that there's sort of a lag? Just curious that that building access phenomenon, I suspect is kind of similar for everybody, and that seems to be impacting you more, but you're doing better on equipment. A lot of moving pieces there, but yes, I guess, it kind of comes down to, how do you feel about either timing or kind of the nature of service maybe versus the broader market? David Gitlin : Yes. On the equipment side, look, we've added the salespeople. We've introduced some new products. It's not really putting a new machine, a new construct in place. It was really accelerating, doing what we know how to do, with more focus and energy. So the ability to turn that in an effective way, has been positive and a bit easier than it has been on the aftermarket for us, because it hasn't traditionally been as big of a focus area for us as it has been perhaps for a couple of our peers that have done well in this area. So, I would say on the aftermarket, we added a new head of aftermarket, Ajay Agrawal. He\u2019s been working tightly with the new heads of aftermarket that we put in place in the BUs and the BU presidents. And now we\u2019ve put in place a playbook that we know works, but it's not a playbook that you can effect overnight. So adding the sales and sales support people, adding a blue edge tiered offering, adding digital offerings that can really differentiate the overall offerings. So a lot of this playbook of how we think about pricing parts and how we can provide more value-added to our customers, that playbook is in the process of being rolled out. But when we talk about a 20% increase in our chiller coverage this year, that's a pretty big percentage. And a lot of 2020 was putting that foundation in place. 2021, for us, is the show-me year. And now we\u2019ve got to kind of go realize a lot of that foundation that we put in place last year. Josh Pokrzywinski : Okay. And then on the portfolio side, clearly asset prices are high out there. I know parts of fire and security, namely Chubb, got a peak under the hood a couple of years ago now. What\u2019s the appetite to maybe explore some dispositions, just given that multiples are fairly high in the marketplace? David Gitlin : Look, we said consistently that we would be very objective as we look at our current portfolio, and that's continued. We started that process day one, and that's going to continue really forever. So we look at all aspects of the portfolio, whether they're worth more to someone else than they are to us, and whether they fit in our long-term strategy. And that applies - I mean, you mentioned Chubb. It applies really across the board. So we will continue to assess. We will continue to do what's right for our shareholders. If we make that determination, we will look at what to sell and what's the right time to sell. And then the exciting thing for me is that we now have the balance sheet flexibility to start looking more aggressively at bolt-on M&A. So, we're hopeful to see some of that in \u201821 as well. Josh Pokrzywinski : All right. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Dave for any further remarks. David Gitlin : Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining. Sam is around to take your questions, and we appreciate all of the focus and attention this morning. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available to download from the Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com.  I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer.  Except as otherwise noted, the company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-recurring and/or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items. The company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings, and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. This morning, we\u2019ll review our financial results for the first quarter and discuss the full year 2021 outlook and we\u2019ll leave time for questions at the end. Once the call is opened up for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to give everyone the opportunity to participate.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Thank you, Sam, and good morning everyone. Starting on slide two with an overview of the quarter. Q1 was a great quarter for us and an early indication that a global economic recovery is underway. Areas of our portfolio that have been performing well have continued to improve, and those businesses and verticals that were acutely impacted by the pandemic are showing early indications of recovery.  Overall, volume came in stronger than we planned. Reported sales were up over 20%, including organic growth of 17% driven by another very strong quarter in North American Residential, which was up 50%. We also saw strong growth in commercial HVAC and transport refrigeration. All of our segments contributed to the organic growth in Q1 as the organization continued to execute well on our growth initiatives, including the aftermarket, which grew close to double digits. Notably, compared to the first quarter of 2019, we grew sales about 6% organically. This was coupled with strong order trends leading to a healthy backlog at the end of the quarter. Orders were up over 30% compared to last year driving the organic backlog up 13% sequentially and up close to 20% year-over-year. We produced $608 million of adjusted operating profit, up approximately 40% year-over-year. Given supply chain constraints, we are incurring some additional inflationary pressures and higher logistics costs and meeting customer demand. We are working to mitigate these headwinds through additional cost and pricing actions.  Finally, I am encouraged by our free cash flow generation in the first quarter. Though we do not expect to regularly adjust guidance for the full year after just one quarter, we are increasing guidance on sales, earnings, and free cash flow given our stronger-than-expected Q1 results and confidence in the macro trends that we're seeing. We now expect reported sales to grow 7% to 10%, including a 2% tailwind from FX. We expect adjusted EPS to increase by about 20% at the midpoint, and we are increasing our projected free cash flow for the year by about $100 million to about $1.7 billion. Slide three shows the flywheel that I've used in prior earnings calls to explain how our key focus areas will drive shareholder value. In the upper left, we continue to ensure that we drive a performance culture. We are now one year into our journey as a standalone public company, and we are building momentum. We started off by putting a playbook in place, and a year later I can say that we are a fundamentally different company from our culture to our strategy, to our targeted investment prioritization, balance sheet, and capital position.  Carrier 700 is the cornerstone of our unrelenting focus on cost reduction, and we achieved about $60 million in Q1 in a tough environment. Increased input costs are putting pressure on our $225 million target for the year, so we are driving additional cost and price actions to offset the unplanned headwind.  Also core to our new culture is a focus on profitable growth. We are gaining traction on all three pillars of our growth strategy. We are gaining share across the portfolio helped by innovation arising from our increasing R&D spend from $400 million in 2019 to about $475 million this year, and an additional 600 sales and sales support people that we've added over the past nine months.  Regarding aftermarket and digital offerings, we are gaining significant traction as we push our business models to focus more on recurring revenues. We are on track to deliver double-digit aftermarket growth this year, and we continue to expect a number of chillers under contract to increase from 50,000 to 60,000 this year. Increased service coverage and traction on our BluEdge offerings are enabled by our digital solutions that we are implementing across all of our segments.  Lastly, we continue to take a very disciplined approach to capital allocation, which Patrick will cover. We also said that we would continue to invest in solutions for healthy, safe, and sustainable building and cold chain solutions and inorganic growth, both of which I'll discuss on slide four.  In Q1, we had over $80 million of orders for healthy building products and services, and we currently have a global pipeline of sales opportunities of more than $500 million. We created a new healthy building solutions organization under Ajay Agrawal\u2019s leadership with a seasoned team dedicated to this effort.  We also introduced differentiated sought-after offerings, and we're energized by this week's release of our new digital offering called Abound. It is all about giving customers confidence to re-enter crowded indoor environments and providing a healthier indoor experience. Abound gathers performance data from different systems, sensors, and sources and presents it in a smart, simple interface. It gives a clear view of building systems and sensor performance data and identifies and helps to address anomalies. This solution is not a simple rebranding of digital offerings that we had in our portfolio. It is an open architecture SaaS, Coud-based platform and acts as an intelligent layer interfacing with not only our automated logic controls platform, but also with third-party building management systems and sensors throughout the building.  We have had pilots under way with key vertical customers in the office building space, the educational sector, and the sports and entertainment vertical. Those have gone tremendously well. A huge vote of confidence is that we signed a deal to support the Atlanta Braves as they start to welcome fans back to Truist Park. Abound will monitor the indoor space covering a range of food and beverage locations and club spaces for guests.  As a SaaS platform, Abound is expected to drive more recurring revenues, including subscription and services and also to help pull through additional Carrier equipment sales. We are seeing equally strong progress on our other key ecosystem of focus, healthy, safe, and sustainable cold chain solutions.  Sensitech, our cargo monitoring business, had a record Q1 with sales up 16% due in large part to demand related to the distribution of COVID vaccines. Similar to Abound, a key differentiator is our cloud-based digital offering that we are building in partnership with AWS called Lynx. As a key launch customer, SeaCube recently selected the Lynx fleet solution to deliver enhanced digital capabilities for 2,000 refrigerated containers.  And finally, on the right side of the chart, we highlight our inorganic growth progress. We were very pleased to announce our agreement to acquire Giwee, which we referred to by its brand name of CHIGO. This acquisition will help accelerate our growth in the attractive variable refrigerant flow and international light commercial markets, which have consistently had outsized growth rates over traditional markets.  With the acquisition of CHIGO, we will own important VRF technology, design capabilities, and low-cost manufacturing that we can scale globally. We expect to close the transaction with a majority shareholder in 2Q, and we are excited to welcome the CHIGO team to the Carrier family.  We also continued to add and promote superb talent as we lean into the deployment of the Carrier Way. As an example, we recently welcomed Jennifer Anderson to Carrier, leading corporate development strategy and serving as our Chief Sustainability Officer. She will help drive another key strategic focus ESG. ESG remains a very important focal point for Carrier as we work toward delivering on our 2030 commitments. We are tracking to our commitment of reducing our customers\u2019 carbon emissions by more than one gigaton as we introduce more energy efficient and electric solutions.  Last week Carrier improved to a top quartile score with Sustainalytics and we are now number five within the building products category out of 129 companies. And we also continue to make good progress on our D&I initiatives. Our number of diverse executives has increased significantly since 2015 and we are leaning in to making sustainable changes to ensure that we have a truly inclusive culture.  With that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave, and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide five. As Dave discussed, Q1 was a great start to the year. Sales of $4.7 billion were up 21% versus the prior year. Currency was a 4 point tailwind for sales in the quarter, about $150 million. On the top line, we saw a return to year-over-year organic growth in almost all of our businesses in Q1, and all three segments exceeded their organic growth expectations for the quarter.  Organic sales growth of 17% was significantly better than we expected, and March was particularly strong across our businesses. Adjusted operating profit was up 39% compared to last year, and operating margin expanded 170 basis points. Strong sales growth and benefits from the Carrier 700 were partially offset by investments. Results also included some higher freight costs and a product trouble issue at a minority JV. Price/cost in the quarter was about neutral.  Earnings conversion was better than the high teens I shared with you in February, driven by the stronger-than-expected sales performance. We delivered 21% conversion despite the one-time items we previously discussed; the loss of buyer related income, the impact of deferred and equity compensation, and lower conversion on currency.  Excluding these items, conversion was about 30% in the quarter. Free cash flow of $131 million in the quarter mainly reflected better than expected net income and improved working capital performance. During the quarter we repurchased about 976,000 shares at an average cost of $38.40 per share.  Let's now look at how the segments performed starting on Slide six. HVAC organic sales were up 25% in the quarter, driven by the 48% residential growth. Distributor movement was very strong at about 20%, and we believe there was some earlier than expected seasonal inventory build in the channel.  Commercial HVAC sales were up in the mid-teens organically. Strong growth in applied and service more than offset continued lower volume in North America Light Commercial, which was down mid-single digits. Light Commercial order rates were up over 10% in the quarter and field inventory levels are down over 30% compared to last year, positioning this business for a strong Q2. The HVAC team expanded margins by 240 basis points driven by growth in residential and in services. The segment remains on track to generate about 16% margins this year.  Over to refrigeration on slide seven. Sales were up 19% organically as the cyclical recovery in transport that we\u2019ve seen in orders have started to materialize in sales. Transport refrigeration was up 22% in the quarter, driven by over 40% growth in container and truck and trailer recovery, particularly in Europe and Asia. North America truck and trailer grew high-single digits with each month improving. Commercial refrigeration grew low double digits as pent-up demand and re-openings in Europe drove strong growth.  Margins were up 50 basis points in the quarter compared to last year. We continue to meet customer demand, but are incurring some higher costs to do so, including air freight. We expect operating margins to improve as growth in the higher margin North America truck trailer business accelerates.  Flipping to slide eight, organic sales at the fire and security segment grew 3% and both the products and field businesses grew at similar rates. Within the products business, which represents about 60% of the segment sales, residential and commercial fire continued to be solid while access solutions in our industrial businesses remained challenging. Of note, the product business saw a significant pick up in the month of March, leading to a strong end of the quarter. Our field business Chubb generated organic sales growth of about 4%. The growth was largely driven by Europe and order rates were strong especially in Asia. As you can see on the slide, Chubb booked its largest installation order ever. Strong Carrier 700 performance helped drive a 220-basis-point margin improvement in this segment.  Now, let me review the order activity we saw in the first quarter on slide nine. As you can see, our residential and light commercial businesses continued to see strong demand. Backlog in residential was up sequentially, and it's still up almost threefold compared to a year ago and puts us in a solid position for shipments entering Q2 and the cooling season.  Commercial HVAC orders were up high teens compared to last year, and backlog increased over 10% compared to last quarter in that business. For refrigeration, order activity for the truck / trailer business continued to improve sequentially. North America truck / trailer orders were up well over 100% in the quarter, and Europe was up over 50%. Strong order intake and backlogs exiting Q1 should position the refrigeration segment to achieve closer to high teen\u2019s organic sales growth for the year.  Order intake for our fire and security segment also continued to improve sequentially. Product orders were up 5% year-over-year with a strong end to the quarter, especially in residential and commercial fire. Like prior quarters, industrial end markets and the hospitality vertical remained weak, but comparisons get better in Q2.  Field orders were up about 15% organically as activity begins to pick up in Europe and against an easier Asia comp. Installation orders were solid, and we continue to have a record backlog.  Let's walk through the EPS bridge on slide 10. As I mentioned, Q1 EPS of $0.48 was $0.13 higher than prior year, and the growth comes largely from operational performance as you can see on the bridge. Strong sales growth is the main driver here as well as Carrier 700 savings of about $60 million. Operational performance was also impacted by some of the headwinds I referred to earlier, including higher freight costs and the product trouble at a minority JV. While inflationary pressures continue, we're working to offset this through additional costs and pricing actions. We recently announced a second price increase in our residential HVAC business for June as well as an increase in transport refrigeration, and we're implementing similar actions in other areas of our portfolio.  The loss of buyer-related income and the year-over-year impact of deferred and equity comp was about a $0.03 headwind in the quarter. All the other items on the bridge are pretty much in line with what we expected except for the favorable tax item, which will carry through the year.  Let's move to slide 11, updated outlook. Based on stronger-than-expected Q1 performance and an improving outlook, we are increasing our organic sales outlook from a range of 4% to 6% to a new range of 5% to 8%. A bit less than 0.5 point of the incremental organic growth represents incremental pricing actions we already have or are taking to offset higher input costs.  We continue to expect price/cost to be about neutral for the year. We expect our adjusted operating margin now could be a bit over 13.5%. The Q1 favorable discrete tax item means that our full year tax rate should now be around 24% rather than 25%. This all leads to an adjusted EPS outlook range of $1.95 to $2.05, a $0.10 improvement at the mid-point from our initial guidance. Our updated outlook does not include the CHIGO transaction. Finally, as Dave mentioned, we now expect free cash flow of about $1.7 billion.  Slide 12 shows the bridge for the $0.10 improvement in our adjusted EPS outlook from the midpoint of our prior guidance to the midpoint of our current guidance range. The biggest driver is the operational conversion on the additional sales volume. Lower interest expense and the tax item are each adding about $0.02.  Over to slide 13, where I\u2019ll reiterate our capital allocation priorities for 2021. There are no changes to our priorities since the Q4 call, but you have started to see us execute on some of these items. During Q1, we paid down $500 million of long-term debt and with the transactions that have closed or have been announced to date, capital deployment on M&A will exceed $200 million this year.  Last week, we declared a quarterly dividend, and our share repurchase we're making progress to work towards our target of 5 million shares this year. Before I turn it back to Dave, let me just reiterate that the volatile quarters in 2020 should continue to impact the comparisons in 2021.  We still expect strong double-digit organic growth in the first half of 2021, and closer to flat in the second half given the residential comparisons. We expect about half of the full year earnings to be in the first half. So, a good start to the year puts us in a position to raise our full year outlook across the board.  With that, I'll turn it back Dave. David Gitlin : Thanks Patrick. We are pleased with a very strong start to the year. Though much work remains to be done, we are confident in our raised guidance for the balance of the year. With that, we'll open this up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. You may begin. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. David Gitlin : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Maybe I just wanted to circle back on the margin guidance, so you did a low 20s incremental margin all in, in Q1. It looks like the guide for the year maybe imbeds similar to that figure. So, I just wanted to understand, sort of as you look out over the balance of the year versus Q1, it sounds like price/cost isn\u2019t very different from the first quarter, but refrigeration margins should improve. So, maybe help us understand some of the other moving parts around maybe the phasing of cost savings and investment spend over the remaining nine months. Patrick Goris : Yes Julian, good morning, Patrick here. Maybe I\u2019ll answer it as follows. Reported conversion in the first quarter is about 21%. For the full year, we expect reported conversion to be closer to 25%, adjust that for buyer and currency and the one-time items from last year, we get to 30% for the full year. We expect reported conversion to improve from here on out, and so in future quarters, we expect that conversion to improve from the 21% up, and for the full year as I mentioned closer to 25% earnings conversion reported, operationally closer to 30%.  In terms of the investments, we did about 40 million in the first quarter. I think it will be pretty much evenly split throughout the year, and so I don't expect big swings from an investment point of view throughout the quarter. I think you also asked about the input costs compared to our prior guidance. You know, our prior guidance with several tens of millions of dollars of incremental headwinds from inflation and the current guide, that went up by another $70 million or so, so $70 million.  And our current guide assumes that we're offsetting that with about $70 million of incremental pricing. And so, from a timing point of view, for the full year, price/costs will remain neutral. In the second quarter, that maybe the one quarter where price/cost is a little bit unfavorable. Julian Mitchell : Thank you very much. And then maybe secondly, just focusing on that refrigeration segment, the incrementals as you said were weighed down a little bit perhaps in the first quarter, some mix and supply chain issues, maybe help us understand how quickly those improve over the balance of the year in terms of getting that refrigeration incremental up. Patrick Goris : Yes Julian. So, within refrigeration, which had a good sales growth quarter, the growth was as we said, particularly container, international truck and trailer commercial refrigeration. Those carry lower margins than our highest margin North American truck and trailer business. We expect North America truck and trailer would actually perform \u2013 was up high-single digits in Q1. We expect that growth to accelerate from here on out, and so for refrigeration we expect the earnings conversion to improve from here on out. We expect the margins to improve starting in Q2, and for the full year for that segment we expect segment margins to be about 14%. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. David Gitlin : Thanks Julian. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. You may begin. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. David Gitlin : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question on the sales guidance and the organic increase. How should we think about the impact of recent price increases because the scope of price increases that we saw, I think in March was I think 5%, 7% across the industry in resi and applied, and it seems that most of them will become effective in May and June. So, how do you incorporate that in your outlook? Patrick Goris : Yes Andy, so we have announced price increases throughout our businesses. The timing of which and the exact yield of that, of course is always a little bit different than the actual announced price increase. The way you can think about this is, of the 1.5 point increase in organic growth for the full year at the midpoint, so going from 5% organic growth to 6.5% organic growth at the midpoint, a little less than half of that relates to incremental pricing. That gives you, give or take, $70 million of incremental pricing that we\u2019ve assumed in our current guidance, which offsets the $70 million incremental headwind on input costs that I referred to earlier. The balance of the increase in organic growth for the full year is really in HVAC, both resi and commercial, some of that of course includes that price and in transport refrigeration. Those are the areas where we've really pushed up our outlook for the year in terms of organic growth. Andrew Obin : That was a great answer, thank you. And the second question I have for you, with the recent stimulus bill, I think you guys have highlighted \u2013 [indiscernible] has highlighted, we\u2019ve heard it from other folks. You know, a lot of money is going to schools, I think something to the tune of $67 billion a year for the next three years. I think the last stimulus, 70% of this money ended up being spending on capital projects, right. There\u2019s this designation that it should go for air quality improvement, HVAC system improvement.  When we talk to the folks in the industry, people have a really hard time getting their hands around what it actually means. You know, I know that it hasn't been too long, but do you guys have a framework of how to think about the impact of this money in the school vertical (a) this year, and what does it mean for demand for HVAC refurbishment upgrades over the next two years. Thank you. A - David Gitlin : Well, Andy we think it's significant. You look at the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, $130 billion of that went toward school reopening, and then if you look at the President's new proposed infrastructure bill, the American Jobs Plan, it includes an additional $100 billion for schools. So how and when that gets spent will remain to be seen.  Obviously, it needs to flow from the federal to the state to the local school districts, but it's significant because The GAO had a report that said 40% of the school districts have insufficient HVAC. So, when you look at that potential $230 billion of spend, we think a material amount of that will go towards upgrading the HVAC systems, because it's long overdue and it's needed. K-12 is an important part of our business. It represents about 10% of our sales in North America in applied in light commercial. We\u2019ve come out with a very targeted kit offering, which makes it easy for the 16,000 school districts across the country to make a selection and move quickly to implement it. We have a dedicated sales team. We have innovative solutions that we've now come forward with things like Abound and our OptiClean solutions, and we also think it's important because these are sustainable solutions. So, how it plays out this year and next, you will have to see the specifics, but we do think this will provide us with multi-year tail end for our HVAC business.  Operator, can we have the next question \u2013 [Cross Talk] oh! Sorry. Go ahead Andy. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. You may begin. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey, good morning guys. A - David Gitlin : Hey Josh! Josh Pokrzywinski : Okay, so maybe just first question on residential. You know you mentioned the strong sell-in\u2019s \u2013 you know sell-through still good, but not quite as high, backlog still high, so maybe that the channel was still low, but how are you thinking about 2Q here? Can you guys match sell out in 2Q or is inventory for your distributors brimming to the point where maybe they need to de-stock a little bit? A - David Gitlin : Well, 2Q Josh still feels strong. You know, we came in with a nice backlog into 2Q. We do think that it's going to be hard to track quarter-to-quarter. You almost have to step back and look at the full year. I think what we're going to see is normal growth rates for the year with abnormal calendarization.  So, what we saw in the first quarter was sales up 50%, and what we're looking at for the first half is sales probably up around 35% in the first half, and then given the very difficult compare, given the strength we have in the second half of last year, the second half is probably down closer to 20%. So, we're raising \u2013 we had originally thought the year would be low-to-mid single digits. It's clearly looking like it's in the mid-single-digit range for the year, which is not an abnormal kind of year. What's really encouraging is that movement was very strong in the first quarter. It was up over 20% and movements continue to be strong here in 2Q. Now, the inventory levels as you said, they are higher than normal. They are at 30% year-over-year, but having said that, if movement continues to stay at the pace that we've been seeing it, we think that we would end Q2 inventory levels probably 10% to 15% higher than 2019, which is the better compare, which is not completely abnormal. Housing starts continued to be very strong. They'll be up 11%, 12% this year, and we're seeing continued pent up demand, and a lot of the strength we saw or at least a material amount of strength we saw in the first quarter was furnaces, which would not really indicate for a lot of pre-stocking and inventory. So look, we're going to have to keep an eye on it of course, because you know third quarter was up 50, fourth quarter up 25, this quarter up 50. While we continue to take share, we continue to support our customers, we continue to see strong movement, so we feel well positioned certainly in 2Q, and then we'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out. Josh Pokrzywinski : That was helpful. And then I guess just thinking on Carrier 700 and you guys are in the midst of a pretty substantial transformation across the board, including in trying to build out a service organization. I think that comes at a point in time where maybe there\u2019s some bottlenecks out there, whether it's finding new suppliers for sourcing initiatives, hiring folks, training them up. Anything that you're seeing out there that you know maybe kicking some of those initiatives to the right, simply because it's hard to onboard new suppliers, new technicians, you know whatever it is across the board. A - David Gitlin : No Josh. Those are not \u2013 I mean look, there's challenges on Carrier 700, but it is not driven by the ones you mentioned. Clearly, we're seeing inflationary headwinds coming our way. Commodities, we're seeing some headwind there. Of course, input costs from our tier one, tier two suppliers, we have to manage that.  Logistics remain a challenge, and frankly we have to manage productivity because there are some labor shortages in places like our Collierville, Tennessee factory where we're in the process of hiring a few hundred people there, and we got to keep up with not only the short term demand, but the sustained demand that we see coming over the coming quarters. So, there's challenges out there, and I'm really proud of the operations team. I think they are managing it best-in-class, but it's certainly not without its challenges. But I think the things you mentioned were actually try to get out in front, and one of the things that I think has helped us is that as we saw this demand coming, we actually pre-stocked some inventory. Patrick and I authorized a bit of inventory in December and then in January to make sure that we had parts that we were going to need, some buffer stock in the face of a lot of the demand influx that we were anticipating. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Good call on that. I appreciate the color. I\u2019ll get back in line. A - David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. You may begin. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning everyone. A - David Gitlin : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Hey! So, the commercial HVAC growth of mid-teens wouldn't have been something we would have probably guessed coming into the quarter, and that\u2019s with like commercial down mid-single digits in the U.S. So, I am just wondering can you probably just dig in to the next level in terms of the moving pieces you know within that mid-teens. And then you talked about light commercial accelerating in 2Q on a much, much easier comp. Maybe just talk about how you see commercial evolving over the balance of the year? Thanks. A - David Gitlin : Sure. Let me start on the applied side. You know, we were very pleased with that mid-teen growth we saw on the commercial applied side. Obviously, China had some easy compares with sales up there. Sales in China were up over 100%. We were pleased with the growth in Europe. Europe was up in the mid-teen range.  North American equipment was a watch item. We did have a couple of very short-term issues in one of our factories that probably is a short-term issue, so we'll catch up with that here in 2Q. So. North American equipment for us was actually down a bit, and the aftermarket in North America was up double digits. So, I think the North American equipment is poised for a nice recovery, especially when you look at the ABI, the Architectural Billing Index. You know, we looked at 11 months below 50, and it got as low as 29, but now we've been above 50, and in March, it was at 55, which is a very, very good level.  So, of course, a big leading indicator of commercial construction activity, so we're very encouraged about what we're seeing in the applied space in North America, and especially in the verticals like data centers and warehouses, education, which I mentioned on the stimulus package and then healthcare, so \u2013 and we continue to lean into aftermarket growth, which we anticipate will be up double digits and the backlog is strong. Light commercial, it was down a bit. You know it sequentially improved from the fourth quarter. So, every quarter, light commercial has been getting better, but as restaurants and retail start to open up, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing with order trends. So, it's really set up for nice growth.  We were thinking that light commercial would be up mid-single digits. It's probably going to be up around 10% this year, and what we're seeing in light commercial is strong order trends. We're seeing improved backlogs. I mean, it\u2019s not a \u2013 it\u2019s obviously a very easy compare, but the backlog is up 100%, and what's really encouraging is field inventory levels are down. They are down about 35%. So, it's set up for a nice rebound as we get into 2Q and beyond. Nigel Coe : Amazing, amazing, thanks for that great detail. And then on CHIGO acquisition, congratulations on putting in the VRF whitespace, but what\u2019s the plan? Are you going to globalize that product and bring it to the U.S. and then how does the CHIGO fit in with Toshiba, your relationship with Toshiba. Thanks. A - David Gitlin : Yeah, we look at CHIGO as a first step of many. You know, you look at the entire VRF space and international light commercial. We see that as a $25 billion market in 2025, and the reality is if you look back in 2015, VRF, I mentioned this in the prepared remarks, but VRF was half the size of the traditional chiller market, and now they're about the same size, so you can imagine the CAGR for VRF is exponentially higher than some of the other markets, and the issue that we had is we really did not \u2013 we didn't have design capabilities and we were not really a manufacturer, and that's not what we are as an OEM, we\u2019re not a distributor.  So, this was one of the few but important plays that we could make to become a design and manufacturing VRF player with a great operation there outside of Guangzhou in China. So very, very pleased. It gets us to become a more meaningful player. We've been clear that we do have partnerships with folks like Toshiba, with Midea that we're very proud of. I mean these go back decades, and they are great partners. Are there opportunities to more optimize those into win-win relationships? We frankly believe that there are, and we\u2019re in very constructive discussions with those partners, but we see the CHIGO acquisition enabling that to not only be a player for China, but for it to being a global player. Nigel Coe : Thanks David. A - David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. You may begin. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning everyone. A - David Gitlin : Good morning Mr. Sprague. Jeffrey Sprague : Yeah, I've gotten two Spragues this earnings season. It\u2019s like my Italian roots are coming through at the back [ph]. A lot to cover. I just would \u2013 I\u2019d be interested in maybe just Dave circling back to kind of the Healthy Buildings, the dynamic. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on how you're actually kind of defining that, because you know does that pipeline mean it\u2019s kind of around the Abound opportunity or just kind of flush it out a little bit for us, how you would differentiate the pipeline there versus what you're seeing kind of maybe in the core business? A - David Gitlin : Yeah Jeff, the way we try to -- we try to take a very strict and disciplined definition, which is these are sales that we would not have gotten prior to the focus on really Healthy Buildings. So, a lot of the IAQ-type offerings that really became much more prevalent when the pandemic hit, we really put that in the healthy building $500 million pipeline that I talked about.  So, examples would include OptiClean, you know we have orders for more than 30,000 OptiClean units, and we put that in the Healthy Building category. When we sell upgrades that are really driven by filtration or UV lights, we put that in there, and you know we're really, really excited about the new Abound offering.  You know Bobby George and the team have been working on this with almost a skunk works type group over the last six months or so to come out with a differentiated digital offering and that will be a big enabler for Healthy Buildings, because what it'll do is it'll make it visible to the end consumer, how safe and healthy is the indoor environment. You know, we think about it like an Intel Inside strategy, where you start to have end consumers ask for certain chips in their PCs. What we're going to see is certain consumers having expectations that before they make a restaurant reservation or go into a commercial office building or come back into crowded indoor spaces, they're going to have an expectation that they can see the health of the indoor environment, and that the building manager is taking steps to mitigate any anomalies with that, and that\u2019s exactly what Abound will enable, so we will put Abound subscription sales in the Healthy Building category as well. Jeffrey Sprague : Yeah, well that was the second part of my question. You talked a little bit about chiller service attachment, which maybe kind of part of this equation, but are you seeing a different kind of service attachment rate with these offerings, and I guess you kind of alluded to even some new evolving business models there. Maybe just a little more color on that. David Gitlin : We anticipate so Jeff, but it's too early to say. I mean we really \u2013 we've been working for the last few months in the first quarter on pilot projects with a commercial office building. We were very excited with the Atlanta Braves and welcoming - as they welcome fans back to Truist Park. That was a really profound win for us that we are excited about.  We worked with a school, a K-12 school outside of Atlanta as well. So, we've really been proving out the technology. We made it an official offering earlier this week. So, it's too early to say in specific response to your question, but it's clearly \u2013 we have this tiered BluEdge offering, and we believe Abound will drive more of recurring revenue through subscription sales, but also pull through more LTAs and more of our elite BluEdge offerings and equipment sales. Jeffrey Sprague : Right, thanks. I\u2019ll pass the call. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. You may begin. Deane Dray : Hey, good morning everyone. David Gitlin : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : I just want to follow up on Jeff\u2019s line of questions there, just to clarify the definition of the indoor air quality. Is all the school upgrades of the HVAC systems because that is a COVID-related concern and probably would not have had the kind of focus had there not been the pandemic? Are you including that in the indoor air quality opportunity? David Gitlin : No, we\u2019ll base it more on the offering that we provide as opposed to the driver behind it. So, if we go to a school district and what ends up happening is it's a much more kind of an energy efficient play, which is what we do all the time, and the modernization is more around energy efficiency. We probably would not put it in that healthy building category, but if the offering is driven by the underlying premise of driving more healthy and safe indoor environments, yes, we would put those in. Deane Dray : Okay, good. So, that's helpful in terms of framing what's in that indoor air quality pocket. A - David Gitlin : Yes. Deane Dray : And then the second question is, I know it's relatively small, but it did get called out. Is this operational issue at a minority-owned JV? Just if you could flesh out what the issue was? Does it broadly put the spotlight on Carrier\u2019s portfolio of minority JVs, and what's the approach and time frame to address that, you know the number of them there and how might that get rationalized? David Gitlin : Well, on the second part your question Deane, yes, I mean one of our big themes for Carrier since we spun has been focus and simplification. So, if you think about our JV portfolio, we started with 40 minority JVs, and we\u2019ll end this year closer to 32. So, we have been taking a very clinical approach to reducing the number of JVs for various reasons. There are some that really pose risk, but not a lot of value to the overall business.  So we have reduced some of those, and then there are some that we still have that we are in discussions to, you know, reframe them a bit, especially if it's in a very strategic area for us, and we're not consolidating sales or EBIT, that's an area that we're in discussions with our partners on.  With respect to the specific product issue that was in one of our minority JVs, I wish I could say that in things we control we've never had our own product issues, so you know we're not disparaging the JV because of that one issue, but it does highlight that we do want to have more controls in place in some of our critically strategic areas. Deane Dray : Okay, thank you. Patrick Goris : And Deane in terms of the size, it was about a penny. Deane Dray : I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Joe Ritchie : Yes, thank you. Good morning everybody. David Gitlin : Good morning Joe. Joe Ritchie : Since we are on the topic of Healthy Buildings, I may as well ask the question as well. So, it seems like you've grown your opportunity. I think you highlighted 500 -- $500 million this quarter, I think it was $200 million last quarter. But it seems also like the opportunity is pretty broad based. Is there any commentary around like where you're really seeing the uptick, and then also $500 million probably isn't the stopping point? I guess how you're thinking about the addressable opportunity for you guys? David Gitlin : Well, we think Joe that the opportunity you know is significant, and it is, it's broad based across a number of verticals. So, clearly education, K-12 is a key focus area, but even universities. We've been in discussions with universities as they look at -- they are very \u2013 they have a very broad footprint at most of the universities in the United States, but globally as well. Healthcare and hospital is a key focus area for us as well. Commercial office buildings, as people reimagine the future of work and various models there, they do want to make sure that as people come back into the office to providing a safe indoor environment. Stadiums, you know I mentioned the deal with the Braves, but we are optimistic that that would be the first of other deals we would do. So, anywhere where you have kind of people in a somewhat crowded indoor environment, there are starting to be more discussions.  I had dinner with a friend who owns restaurants a couple of weeks ago, and he wants to add OptiClean units for his various restaurants, so we're seeing a lot of interest. You know the question we get a lot is going to be how sticky is it. We know that sustainability is a sticky theme.  In healthy, once the pandemic is more under control globally, will Healthy Building be a thing of the past, and I think that especially when you think about our Abound offering, that is one of the keys to really making sure that this is a sticky trend for years to come. Because what it's taught us is that COVID isn't the first airborne transmitted disease and it won't be the last, and people are much more in tune with having safe indoor environment. So, to make it visible to them and then how do you ultimately use AI and ML [ph] to anticipate and correct any deficiencies with indoor environments, I do think this is a trend that will withstand the test of time. Joe Ritchie : That\u2019s helpful color Dave, thanks. And then maybe my follow-on for Patrick. I mean you gave a lot of details around the guidance for the year. I guess if I try to look, it looks like slightly differently. The first quarter came in much better than expected at the segment level, I think about $100 million better. The guidance for the full year only kind of implies like maybe even half of that at the segment level. And so, I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand like the conservatism that's baked into the rest of the year versus like what you expect from incremental headwinds for the rest of the year. Patrick Goris : I think Joe, the way you can look at it is, as always one element is within residential HVAC. We mentioned that some of the strength we've seen, we believe could have been some of the acceleration of the seasonal inventory build. So, that would not necessarily change the full year outlook for resi, although we did raise resi a little bit for the year, but not as much as the [indiscernible]. The second element, this is for fire and security, we saw a very strong end to the quarter in March, and so it's a quick turn business. We have not updated our full year outlook for that segment at this point, and so would take another card there.  In terms of profitability, full year as I said $70 million more price, offsetting $70 million more of headwind, and then a little bit more volume leverage from what we raised. We did dial in a little bit more of the air freight costs as well for the full year. So that's kind of the \u2013 a little bit more detail and color around the full year outlook. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Thanks Patrick. I appreciate it. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Joe. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. You may begin. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning guys. David Gitlin : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : Just a clarification on North America applied, how much of that was the watch item more of the supply issue versus kind of demand still being choppy there. David Gitlin : No, it had nothing really. We did -- as we transferred over on 3PL and we made it, we had a couple of issues as we did that. So, it was a very short-term issue which is now behind us. Jeff Hammond : Okay, and then any supply chain issues leaking into the transport piece. We've heard a lot about just truck, but anything you are seeing in transport. David Gitlin : Yes, I mean the supply chain issues are fairly broad based. I mean there are electron \u2013 there are electronic issues, there are raw material issues, even things like resins that we put into our injection molding process. We have to work with a couple of key tier one suppliers in our transport refrigeration business that are key watch items.  So I think the team is managing it well, but there are some things that the team is having to do. In some cases, air freight over ocean which we would have done in the past, so it's not without its cost and challenges, but just like the rest of the portfolio, I'm really, really proud of how the team is working with the supply chain to manage them, but there are certainly issues that the team is battling every day. Patrick Goris : Jeff, we are meeting customer demand. We are just having a little bit more input costs in doing so, including freight. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. And then if I could just sneak one more in. Maybe just you know we are kind of through a lot of the pandemic, reopening, demand seems to be inflecting here. And just beyond, maybe just the minority interest stakes, how are you thinking about portfolio reshaping at a bigger level in some of the businesses that maybe don't fit longer term? Thanks. David Gitlin : Well look, we said that we would take a very clinical and structured review of our existing portfolio, and I can assure you that we started that on day one and that's something that will continue forever. So, we continue to look at every aspect of our portfolio and put it through a rigorous set of lenses to determine, is it the right kind of area for us to invest and improver or is it worth more in the hands of someone else and we would use those proceeds to invest elsewhere? So we continue to look at all aspects of our current portfolio.  We are very, very energized by the playbook we have in place. We have great confidence as does our Board in our strategic roadmap. We have our three pillars of growth funded by Carrier 700. We have these two big ecosystems we are focused on, you know healthy, safe, and sustainable building and cold chain solutions, so we'll continue to look at rounding out those portfolios.  We put our toe in the water with a bolt-on M&A with CHIGO, and we\u2019ll look at -- obviously we're looking at others as we go forward. And then we of course know there's more transformational opportunities out there in the portfolio, but we're really energized by our ability to execute on the strategic road map that we have in front of us. Jeff Hammond : Okay, fair enough, well thank guys. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. You may begin. Steve Tusa : Hey guys, good morning. David Gitlin : Hey Steve. Steve Tusa : What was price and cost in the quarter for you guys? Patrick Goris : It was about neutral, Steve. Steve Tusa : And the actual price capture? Patrick Goris : A little bit it \u2013 well, less than a point. In the quarter itself, it actually was \u2013 in the quarter, in Q1 itself, it was less than 0.5 point. For the full year, it will be a little less than 1 point for the total company. Steve Tusa : Yeah, okay, got it. And you were neutral on commods [ph], okay. When you talk to the channel, and I know we kind of talked to your channel as well, obviously. But when you talk to others in the channel, maybe outside of Watsco, what are they saying about what\u2019s actually happening on the ground. The sell-through is pretty good. Is there a little bit of catch up from people not be able to get product last year, so they kind of scheduled it for the spring? I mean what\u2019s -- what are you hearing from like some of your key contractor customers? David Gitlin : Well, what we hear from really both our distributors and our contractors is that demand is strong. That it\u2019s real demand and that they're pushing for the right mix from us so they can support the customers. Obviously, new construction continues to be extremely strong, and then what you're seeing is we had anticipated that in previous downcycles what you would have seen is more repair over replacement. We actually haven't seen any of that.  We've actually seen a lot more replacement of entire units, entire condensing units or entire systems, and I think it's because -- partly because there's more stay-at-home, and partly because there's more liquidity in this down cycle than we saw in previous. So, people are prioritizing the spend they have on their homes, and we're also seeing people buy a lot of new homes and often when you buy a new home, one of the things you do in your inspection is look at the HVAC system, so that's probably driving some of it.  But what we're hearing, we were actually on the phone recently last week with a key distributor down in the Texas area, and they said that they're very encouraged by what they're seeing from their contractors. They are encouraged by Carrier\u2019s ability. It's not that we haven't had our hiccups, but our ability to support them and I think that's helped some of the share gains that we've seen, and we'll have to see. Obviously, there's inventory out there in the channel, but we'll have to see. If movement can continue to be north of 20%, then it\u2019s an encouraging sign. Steve Tusa : And you mentioned share gains, would you at the margin given everybody else\u2019s kind of raising price dramatically, I mean would you at the margin make targeted efforts with price to allow distribution to kind of go after some share in local markets selectively? David Gitlin : We\u2019ve been consistent on a price that I think others have announced. We came in with a price increase coming into the year. We announced for resi up to 7% increase in June, so look, there\u2019s clearly inflationary pressures on there on our side, and we really have no choice but to raise prices, not only in resi, but across the portfolio and I think customers expect it. So, we'll be doing that, and I think it seems like from what I've read from our peers that that's an industry wide phenomenon. Steve Tusa : Is there anywhere where price is down, that\u2019s my final question, sorry. David Gitlin : No. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. David Gitlin : Thank you. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen. You may begin. Gautam Khanna : Yes, thanks, good morning. David Gitlin : Good morning. Gautam Khanna : I want to ask about the competitive environment. You know last year, we had a couple resi competitors that couldn't produce to meet the \u2013 you know [inaudible] for example. Lennox mentioned on their call that they've seen some issues among resi competitors as well, and I was curious are you guys seeing that; and if so, kind of how is that manifested in your orders if there's any way to quantify it. David Gitlin : Yeah look, we will never comment on a competitor. We have a tremendous amount of respect for our competition, and I think we all go through various challenges during different times. So, I think that we are all experiencing various challenges. I think our operations team has gone a great length to support our customers, and I think that because we did pre-stock some inventory anticipating the ramp, I think that\u2019s helped us. I know our team has been working around the clock to support operationally. We\u2019ve tried to be very strategic with our supply chain and our own operations to have some level of redundancy, so if there is an issue in one place, we can ramp up somewhere else. So, we are not by any means flawless. We have our challenges, but I do think the operational performance has helped us pick up a bit of share along the way. Gautam Khanna : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And that\u2019s all the time we have for questions and answers today. I like to turn the call back over to speakers for any closing remarks. David Gitlin : Okay, well thank you. Thank you everyone for joining. Clearly, we are very energized by the first quarter and what we see in our performance and some of the macro trends, so we are energized by the quarter and what lies ahead, and we encourage you to please reach out to Sam with any follow-up questions. Thank you, all. Operator : This concludes today's program. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Samuel Pearlstein : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your flexibility in accommodating the earlier start time for the call.  Since we plan to discuss the Chubb transaction as well as the second quarter earnings, we have more flexibility if the call runs a little longer. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. Except as otherwise noted, the company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a nonrecurring and/or nonoperational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items. The company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. This morning, we'll review our financial results for the second quarter, discuss the full year 2021 outlook and the agreement we announced Tuesday to sell our Chubb business. We will leave time for questions at the end. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. It is great to be hosting this call from the Carrier-cooled New York Stock Exchange, and we appreciate the support that we've received from the team here. Please turn to Slide 2.  Before we discuss the second quarter results, let me address the press release that we issued Tuesday announcing that we signed an agreement to sell our Chubb business to APi Group for an enterprise value of $3.1 billion. To be clear, Carrier's Global Fire & Security products business is not part of this transaction and remains an integral part of Carrier's portfolio and our healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building strategy. We committed at our Investor Day last year to objectively assess our portfolio and do so through a rigorous application of our strategic and financial priorities. Within our Fire & Security portfolio, our products business is differentiated with leading market positions and attractive margins. Chubb is an industry leader with 13,000 employees that do a great job with installation and maintenance supporting our customers but it is an agnostic business that does not pull through our products and yields lower margins.  We concluded that Chubb is more strategic to APi Group than it is to us. Divesting Chubb will significantly simplify our business. Chubb represents over 20% of our employees or less than 10% of our adjusted operating earnings. Selling Chubb will increase our focus on our core businesses and enable us to reinvest the proceeds consistent with our capital allocation priorities to create long-term shareholder value. Patrick will discuss in more detail, but our capital allocation priorities have remained consistent : funding organic and inorganic growth, dividends and share buyback within a solid investment-grade credit rating.  Our intention is to use the cash proceeds and excess cash on the balance sheet for acquisitions, buybacks and debt pay down over 12 to 18 months to help position the company for strategic growth and to generate attractive shareholder returns. The net result will be a new, more focused Carrier with more product differentiation, faster revenue growth, higher margins and higher returns on invested capital. This was an important deal for Carrier, and I want to thank our team and advisers for their tremendous work. Now turning to our Q2 results on Slide 3.  Q2 was another strong quarter for us. Our growth continues to be fueled by broad economic momentum, our position at the epicenter of important secular trends and the benefit of our strategic investments. Managing the surge in growth has strained our extended supply chain, but our teams are navigating those challenges well to support our customers. You see our progress reflected in our 2Q results. Organic sales were up over 30%. Particularly encouraging was that the growth was strong across our portfolio and that we even grew 7% versus 2Q of 2019. Orders were up about 35% organically compared to last year, driving our backlog up 8% sequentially and up over 20% year-over-year, positioning us well for 3Q and the second half of the year.  We produced $821 million of adjusted operating profit up over 70% year-over-year. And consistent with what we said during the April earnings call, Q2 incremental margins improved sequentially from Q1. Free cash flow continues to be strong with first half free cash flow up more than 30% over the first half of last year. Given our first half performance, strong backlog and expectations around the balance of the year, we are again raising our full year guidance for sales, earnings and cash.  We now expect organic sales to grow 10% to 12%, adjusted EPS to increase by about 30% compared to last year, and we are increasing our projected free cash flow by $200 million to about $1.9 billion. Now turning to Slide 4. We remain confident in sustained growth in our end markets and that our new operating system, culture and team performance position us well to lead within our space.  Key secular trends are likely to propel sustained growth for our industry. With people spending 90% of their time indoors and increasingly returning to their offices and recreational activities, we see more spend being allocated to the health, safety, comfort and intelligence of indoor environments of all types, from homes to schools to hospitals to commercial office buildings.  Likewise, the need for safe cold chain solutions has been intensified by the focus on vaccine distribution and the increasing global middle classes demand for more fresh produce and other refrigerated products. And of course, the need for sustainable solutions. Given that the building sector contributes about 40% of carbon emissions and food waste contributes another 10% to 15%, we are confident that spend on sustainability will continue to drive demand for our green solutions.  We, therefore, remain laser focused on healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions, and we are leaning into those trends by executing on our 3-pronged growth strategy : Growing our core, expanding product extensions and increasing recurring revenues through digitally enabled aftermarket offerings. And we are seeing strong progress, as you can see on Slide 5.  We have booked $250 million in healthy building orders year-to-date, and our active pipeline sits at $500 million. We are confident that spend on healthy buildings is not only sticky but that it will accelerate as building owners will play both defense and offense on behalf of their occupants. Defensive spend is largely focused on defending against the spread of airborne illnesses. For example, 40% of classrooms in the United States have insufficient ventilation and studies show that better ventilation and filtration materially reduced the spread of microscopic particulates like COVID and other illnesses like the flu and common colds. Building owners are also starting to invest in better ventilation to play offense.  Recent studies have shown that people performed twice as well when the indoor environment is optimized. High CO2 levels, which can occur in crowded classrooms and offices with poor ventilation have been proven to impact brain-based skills while better ventilation and filtration significantly improved cognitive function. Because of the many benefits of healthy indoor air environments, our goal is to make indoor air visible. So good air quality becomes as important and expected as safe drinking water. Abound is a key enabler to make that happen.  We received favorable feedback from our key launch customers, which include a commercial office building and an elementary school, and we have deployed it in our company headquarters where we have been demonstrating its power to customers. We are now leveraging our global sales force to deploy Abound and have had significant interest from marquee customers. In addition to Abound, we recently launched a WiFi-enabled Carrier home air purifier with a HEPA-level filter as one of our latest healthy home offerings. We have now sold over 38,000 OptiClean units. On K-12, we have a dedicated team offering catered solutions to our customers, resulting in sales to about 15% to 20% more school districts so far this year compared to last year as part of what we expect to be a significant opportunity over the next few years.  Similarly, our connected cold chain offerings are gaining traction. Our cloud-based digital Lynx offering that we are building in partnership with AWS was recognized by Fast Company as one of 2021's world-changing ideas. In the container space, we are adding connectivity for thousands of units each month and now can support mixed fleets Carrier and Non-Carrier, thereby increasing our recurring revenues and reducing our customer maintenance and logistic costs.  We had significant Lynx wins this quarter with truck/trailer, including 1,700 more trailer refrigeration units for Prime and a 3-year supply agreement with U.K. grocer Sainsbury's for all of its truck and trailer transport refrigeration equipment. CORTIX is Carrier's AI and IoT platform that offers predictive insights, recommendations and autonomous actions to optimize equipment performance and building operations while minimizing our customers' energy consumption. Currently, over 220,000 pieces of equipment are connected to CORTIX. Digital solutions are helping to drive increased aftermarket and recurring revenues.  Aftermarket sales for Carrier were up about 20% in Q2 over last year, all helped by our differentiated BlueEdge tiered offerings. Our attachment rate in commercial HVAC was more than 35% in Q2, and we are on track to add another 10,000 chillers to long-term contracts this year from about 50,000 to 60,000. Likewise, in our Refrigeration business, our Europe truck trailer business sold nearly 6,000 BlueEdge service agreements in the first half of the year.  In addition, our Fire & Security segment continues to expand our key digital offerings. Earlier this year, LenelS2 was featured in the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, and we're excited to work with Apple on providing BlueDiamond mobile credentials in Apple Wallet, on iPhone and Apple Watch. As employees come back to office buildings, this work can increase the profile of access control solutions that help reduce touch points, enhance occupant experience and increased confidence in indoor environments. So very significant progress on healthy, safe and intelligent offerings and recurring revenues. And on Slide 6, you see similar progress on our focus on sustainability. In short, we are committed to providing environmentally sustainable solutions and our performance over the past year reflects just that. We are on track to meet our commitment of reducing our customers' carbon emissions by more than 1 gigaton and ensuring our operations are carbon neutral by 2030. Electrification and energy efficiency are major focus areas for us. Commercial heat pumps in Europe and residential heat pumps in North America were both up 20% to 30% in the quarter. Electrification is equally critical to our Refrigeration business. Interest in our Vector eCool unit in Europe remains high and our backlog continues to grow. This is the only 100% electric trailer reefer unit in the market today.  Our efforts in helping customers reduce emissions and creating more energy-efficient solutions are starting to be reflected in some of our external ratings, including improvements in both our MSCI and Sustainalytics scores in the past year.  As you can see on the slide, we are now considered a leader in the industry. So great progress on ESG, which is a fundamental aspect of who we are. So before I turn it over to Patrick, a word on a leadership change that we recently announced. In a couple of weeks, Tim White will join us as President of our Refrigeration segment.  Tim has been running GE's multibillion-dollar onshore wind business for the Americas region, and he ran key P&Ls within Collins Aerospace that included electric systems, environmental control systems and engine control systems. He is the perfect leader to take this well-positioned business to the next level as we focus on electrification, digitalization and sustainable solutions.  I also want to thank David Appel for his tremendous leadership of the segment. We are fortunate to have David moving to Paris where our commercial refrigeration business is headquartered to provide the focus that, that business needs to improve operational, strategic and financial performance. We appreciate David taking on this critical assignment. So with that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with comments about the quarter and the outlook and then provide additional color on the Chubb transaction. Please turn to Slide 7. As Dave mentioned, Q2 was a good quarter with sales, operating earnings, adjusted EPS and free cash flow all exceeding our expectations.  Sales of $5.4 billion were up 37% compared to last year. Currency was a 5-point tailwind for sales in the quarter or about $200 million and acquisitions, that's mainly Chigo, added another point of growth. Given the impact from COVID last year, this quarter obviously had an easy comparison. Nonetheless, organic sales growth of 31% was significantly better than we expected across all our businesses. Adjusted operating margin expanded over 300 basis points to 15.1%. Strong sales growth and benefits from Carrier 700 were partially offset by investments and higher input costs. As we expected, price/cost was negative in the quarter given the timing of price and cost increases, Much stronger-than-expected demand, combined with supply chain challenges negatively impacted factory efficiency. It also meant material purchases went beyond block positions. And as a result, we bought some materials and components at spot prices and utilized expedited freight. I'll address our outlook for the balance of the year with respect to price and cost in a few slides, but I'll share that we already announced additional pricing actions to offset rising inflationary pressures throughout our supply chain.  Reported earnings conversion of about 24% improved sequentially, and excluding currency and acquisitions, conversion was in the high 20s. Free cash flow of $482 million in the quarter reflected better-than-expected net income and was similar to last year's second quarter despite $180 million of higher interest and tax payments. Finally, we repurchased about 2 million shares at an average price of $44.33 during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to about 3 million shares.  Let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on Slide 8. HVAC organic sales were up 32% in the quarter with nearly 35% residential HVAC growth. As we previously said, we expect that residential field inventory levels to finish approximately 10% to 15% higher than the end of Q2 2019. Strong distributor movement of over 20% compared to last year led to field inventories ending the quarter only 7% higher than at the end of Q2 of 2019, a much more balanced inventory level. North American light commercial business saw a significant rebound with sales up over 60% in the quarter. Light commercial field inventory levels are now down just 3% year-over-year. Overall, commercial HVAC sales were up about 20% organically. HVAC team expanded margins by 300 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong growth across all businesses in this segment, including services. The segment remains on track to generate about 60% adjusted operating margin this year.  Moving to refrigeration on Slide 9. Sales were up 38% organically as the cyclical recovery in transport that we see in orders continue to convert into sales. Transport refrigeration was up over 40% in the quarter with very strong growth in both global truck/trailer and container. Our Sensitech business continued to benefit from the vaccine rollout and was up about 20% in the quarter. Commercial refrigeration grew about 30% as reopenings in Europe drove strong growth.  Margins for this segment were up 320 basis points in the quarter compared to last year, mainly as a result of the higher sales. We continue to meet customer demand but are incurring higher costs to do so, including air freight. We expect operating margins to improve in the second half as the higher-margin North America truck and trailer business recovery continues. Given the higher input costs, we now expect full year 2021 operating margin for this segment to be in the mid-13% range, a little lower than we previously expected.  Moving on to Slide 10. Organic sales at the Fire & Security segment grew 25%, and both the products and field businesses grew at similar rates. Within the Products business, which represents about 60% of the segment sales, residential and commercial fire continued to be solid. Given the easier comparisons, Access Solutions returned to double-digit growth our industrial businesses were up high single digits.  In industrial fire, we saw the recovery for upgrades and retrofits begin in marine services and in the oil and gas markets. Higher sales and Carrier 700 performance helped drive a 140 basis point margin expansion in this segment. With the higher sales outlook and the timing of price and cost actions, we expect higher margins in the back of the year compared to the first half of the year and overall margins to be in the mid-13s for the year.  Now let me review the order activity we saw in the second quarter on Slide 11. As you can see, our residential and light commercial businesses continued to see strong demand. Backlog in residential is up sequentially and points to a better second half than we previously expected. Commercial HVAC orders were up over 30% compared to last year, and backlog increased almost 20% year-over-year and up mid- to high single digits sequentially from last quarter.  For Refrigeration, order activity for the truck/trailer business continued to improve sequentially. Strong order intake and backlog exiting Q2 should position this segment to achieve the expected high teens organic sales growth for the full year. Order intake for our Fire & Security segment also continued to improve sequentially. The product orders were up a bit over 25% year-over-year, especially in residential and commercial fire. Field orders were up 25% to 30%, organic.  I'll skip Slide 12. So let's move to Slide 13, our updated outlook. To be clear, we will include Chubb in the outlook until the transaction closes. Based on stronger-than-expected Q2 performance and higher backlogs, we are increasing our organic sales outlook from a range of 5% to 8% to a new range of 10% to 12%. A bit more than half a point of the incremental organic growth represents incremental pricing actions we already have or are taking to offset higher input costs versus our April guidance. Last quarter, we said material and component input costs were about $120 million or so higher than 2020. We now expect those input costs to be up an additional $125 million. We intend to offset this through additional pricing actions. We recently announced the third price increase in our residential HVAC business for September as well as a third price increase in transport refrigeration, and we are implementing similar actions in other areas of our portfolio.  Our new outlook includes $125 million of additional pricing compared to our April guidance. For the full year, we expect price cost to be neutral though we expect it to be a modest headwind in Q3, offsetting higher input costs with incremental pricing on a dollar-for-dollar basis protects profitability, but of course, hurts reported margin and conversion.  Despite these cost inefficiencies, we now expect to deliver an adjusted operating margin of over 13.5% for the year, better than our previous outlook. Another way to think about the outlook is that the revenues are now expected to be about $1 billion higher than the April guide. Of that, about $125 million is priced to offset increased input costs and about $200 million is acquisition-related sales with little profit contribution this year.  The conversion on the remaining $650 million to $700 million of sales approaches the 30% we would normally expect. This all leads to an adjusted EPS outlook range of $2.10 to $2.20, a $0.15 improvement at the midpoint from our prior guidance. We also now expect free cash flow to be about $1.9 billion, up $200 million from our prior guidance. Slide 14 shows a bridge for the $0.15 improvement in our adjusted EPS outlook from the midpoint of our prior guide to the midpoint of our current guidance. The biggest driver is the operational conversion on additional sales. Moving over to Slide 15. I'll provide more details regarding Chubb's transaction.  You can see a brief profile of Chubb on the left side of the slide. We expect revenues for Chubb to be about $2.2 billion this year with high single-digit operating margins. Excluding Chubb, Carrier's operating margins would be about 50 to 100 basis points higher, free cash flow conversion about 100%, and we would also expect to have a higher growth and modestly higher return on invested capital profile. The remaining Fire & Security segment will include a portfolio of differentiated, high-margin businesses with leading positions in their respective markets. Sales would be about $3.5 billion and operating margin in the high teens. With respect to transaction details, the enterprise value is $3.1 billion, and net after-tax cash proceeds are expected to be about $2.6 billion. As part of the transaction, about 2/3 of Carrier's total pension and post retirement assets and liabilities will be transferred to APi. That is over $2 billion and significantly simplifies and derisks our balance sheet. Related to the pension, we expect most to all of our noncash, nonservice pension benefit on the income statement to go away. While this generates about $70 million in annual earnings, we do not believe it represents any economic value. As customary, the sale is subject to a consultation process and regulatory approvals. Expected close is late Q4 2021 or early Q1 2022.  As to the use of proceeds, we intend to use the approximately $2.6 billion in net proceeds as well as available excess cash for a combination of acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. We expect to delever by about $750 million post transaction to maintain our leverage profile commensurate with the EBITDA reduction. We have a growing pipeline of acquisitions that align with our strategic priorities, and our Board just approved an incremental $1.75 billion share repurchase authorization.  We will be flexible between share repurchases and acquisitions, and now expect 2021 repurchases to exceed the 5 million shares we previously discussed. In closing, we had a good first half with strong double-digit organic growth. Congratulations to our team in supporting stronger-than-expected demand in a very challenging supply chain environment.  With our performance so far, along with a solid order activity and backlog growth, we feel confident meaningfully raising our full year guidance. And the Chubb transaction simplifies our portfolio, enhances management focus, creates a more attractive company profile and generates cash to reinvest in higher share owner value-creating opportunities. With that, I'll turn it back to you, David. David Gitlin : Thanks, Patrick. We are very pleased with our performance as we are now halfway through 2021, and we remain confident in our team's ability to navigate supply chain challenges to support our customers and drive continued results in 2H and beyond. With that, we'll open this up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Congrats on getting Chubb off the board. Just a couple of questions around that, and Patrick alluded to it a little bit on the repo comment. But just kind of wondering how actionable some of the redeployment might be prior to the actual close of the deal, whether you have the appetite maybe to even get a more of a running start on share repo or some of the M&A that you're talking about in the pipeline possibly happens relatively quickly. Patrick Goris : Yes, Jeff, a couple of comments. One, I would say that what we're looking at from an inorganic growth point of view and the acquisitions there, I would say that is really unrelated to the timing of the Chubb proceeds. As we look at what's in the pipeline and actionable, we will go after those opportunities prior to any potential proceeds. Frankly, we -- given the amount of cash we have on the balance sheet, we may not need those Chubb proceeds. In terms of share repurchases, the prior guide that we provided you was about 5 million shares this year. At this point, we probably think it's going to be somewhat closer to $10 million -- 10 million shares not dollars. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. And then also just thinking about maybe strategically the Fire -- the remaining Fire & Security Field assets from here. Although Chubb didn't pull through as much as you would have liked, I think it pulled through some. And I'm just wondering how you might be reorienting your Fire & Security offering, pulling it through HVAC channels and that sort of thing to really kind of augment the overall package that you're trying to push forward here. David Gitlin : Yes, Jeff, we have a healthy channel. I mean Chubb was one of our many distribution channels. So it was -- it's an important piece of our channel, but it was agnostic just as other parts of the channel would be to us. So when you look at our Fire & Security segment, call it, $5.5 billion, you got a couple of billion with Chubb that was in the single digit -- high single-digit range for ROS. And then the remaining $3.5 billion of products you have highly differentiated products, #1 or #2 in all of our segments. It fits well with the whole healthy building trend and the other parts of the HVAC portfolio and the ROS is close to 20%.  So very, very strategic, something that we really want to lean into. And I think that Martin Franklin and the team over at the APi Group will really take what's a great business with Chubb to new levels. We had a choice should we kind of make the investments to take the margins higher of Chubb or let someone else do it and redeploy that capital for parts of our portfolio that are more core and more differentiated, and we elected to do the latter. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Congrats on getting Chubb booked in Carrier as opposed to UTX. I don't think Greg Hayes would given you the money, David. Just to clarify on the proceeds. So the way that it was framed earlier this week was $2.9 billion of cash, gross cash and then $0.2 billion of liabilities. But you're talking about $2.6 billion of net kind of cash proceeds. So I just want to confirm the tax leakage is $0.3 billion. That's the first part of that question. And then secondly, how is the cash conversion for Chubb been over time? I'm thinking here about things like pension funding and the like. Patrick Goris : Yes, Nigel, Patrick here. Maybe I'll give you a walk of the $3.1 billion for Chubb, $2 billion to $2.6 billion the estimated net cash proceeds to us. So at the $3.1 billion deduct from that assumed liabilities and other adjustments to the buyer that gets you to $2.9 billion, which is probably the number that you've seen in some of the press releases that went out from the buyer.  And then from the $2.9 billion to the $2.6 billion, it's mainly taxes on a transaction because we are booking a gain, but it also includes some of the fees associated with the transaction. So that's the kind of the walk of the $3.1 billion to the $2.6 billion. In terms of free cash flow conversion on Chubb, actually, Chubb was one of the reasons why our key cash flow conversion for the overall company was less than 100%. And part of that, of course, gets back to the noncash, nonservice pension benefit we saw in the income statement. That's about $70 million on an annual basis. we don't attribute any economic value to that. That headwind called on free cash flow conversion will go away.  I would also add that from an overall company perspective, whether it's from a working capital perspective or an ROIC perspective, Chubb was below the company average. And so without Chubb, all of these metrics, we expect them to improve, including, of course, our operating margin. Nigel Coe : Right. And sticking with Chubb for my follow-on question. Anything to think about from a stranded cost perspective for remainder of Fire & Security and any impact to the tax rates going forward? Patrick Goris : We don't expect a meaningful change on the tax rate going forward versus where we are today. And then stranded costs would be de minimis. When I say de minimis $0.01 or less. And obviously, we will do our best to make that go away. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Congrats on Chubb as well. Patrick Goris : Joe, we can't hear you all that well. Can you try and speak up? Joseph Ritchie : Sorry, is that better? Patrick Goris : Yes, much better. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. Great. So first question, I guess, maybe just use of proceeds. Obviously, you've highlighted the buyback. I'm just curious, from an M&A standpoint, as you think about the portfolio today, where would you prioritize potential M&A in the portfolio today if you were to go down that path. David Gitlin : We are going to go down that path, Joe. We've been clear that in terms of capital allocation, our priorities, our organic and inorganic growth, as Patrick said. Of course, we'll do share buyback and debt pay down, but we've been trying to really aggressively build the pipeline.  We start from our strategic mission, which is to be the world leader in healthy, safe, sustainable, intelligent building and cold chain solutions. So whatever we look at needs to really tie into that overall North Star that we have.  We've been clear on our 3 strategic pillars of growth. We want to strengthen and grow our core. So that would be keeping it right in the center of the fairway. Product extensions and geographic coverage. You saw us put our toe in the water on VRF with Chigo, and that would be in the category of a product extension. And then enhanced aftermarket and digital capabilities.  So you'll see us really leaning into a focus on recurring revenue. So we're still starting to build that pipeline and we're excited to really start to play more offense. And I should mention, by the way, when we talk about capital allocation, of course, as Patrick mentioned, the dividend as well, which is obviously a part of our priorities. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. That makes sense, Dave. And I guess, maybe my follow-on question. Clearly, you guys are dealing with inflationary pressure as is every company that we cover and handling it well.  I guess as you kind of think about the framework for 2022 and potentially the stickiness of some of those price increases, if we were to get into a more benign inflationary backdrop, what does that kind of mean for your margins if we do get more benign inflation? Patrick Goris : Yes, Joe, Patrick here. I'll take that question. It's -- I think it's fair to say that we probably spend more time on price/cost for 2022 than we do for 2021. And so first of all, this year, as you know, we're benefiting from some block positions. And so next year, when those roll off, we do need additional price to offset that. That's why we've announced additional price increases, our third price increase across our segments this year.  And so for next year, of course, we will focus on making sure that those price increases stick that we do get the yield, if price cost remains neutral next year, which frankly is our intention to be at least price/cost neutral for margin, of course, that's a little bit of a headwind. But of course, we always target to do better than that. And if that were the case, that it could benefit our margins. But our first priority is ensuring that price/cost next year remains neutral. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a couple of questions on the core business. I heard your guidance on revenue for the year on Refrigeration organically. Just wondered if you could put a finer point on the assumptions for HVAC and F&S, apologies if I missed it. And within HVAC, what are you assuming for second half residential revenues at this point? David Gitlin : Yes, if you go through the -- you look at the portfolio and Patrick could jump in as well. We increased overall sales, as you know, for the year, our organic is now up 10% to 12%. So HVAC is going to be higher -- for the full year, up higher than 10%.  Resi, we see up in the low teens. Prior, we had been thinking year-over-year, it would be up low to mid-single digits. But we see resi up low teens. And we're very encouraged by light commercial, it's probably up closer to high teens and applied is very strong, probably up in the high single-digit range. And then Refrigeration is likely to be up in the high teens for the full year, and then F&S is high single digits. Julian Mitchell : Perfect. And then just my follow-up question would be around you mentioned price cost in the profit bridge, also what's happening with M&A and FX. Just wondered if there was any updates around Carrier 700 savings in aggregate and also investment spend. And realizing seasonality has sort of messed up a bit for obvious reasons, anything you'd call out third versus the fourth quarter? Patrick Goris : Yes. So Julian, for Carrier 700, you probably recall that we are targeting $225 million this year. At this point, and given that Carrier 700 is a net number, i.e., it takes into account some of the headwinds from input cost inflation. We think that the Carrier 700 savings this year will be somewhat closer to $150 million. And so that's a $75 million less due to higher material and component costs. And as I mentioned earlier, we intend to offset these headwinds as well as some other headwinds such as airfreight with incremental pricing actions in the balance of the year. Operator : Next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Can you maybe just talk about the resi markets. And Dave, kind of what's your view around the status of like the cycle. There's been a lot of debate around, I guess, machines running more. I think the inventory is probably less of an issue, less of a debate now, obviously. But what's kind of happening at a kind of the end market, kind of the end demand level in the state of the cycle? What's your opinion there? David Gitlin : Sure, Steve. We were pleased that in 2Q movement remained strong, which is obviously something that we're tracking very, very carefully. So we thought that our inventory levels at the end of 2Q were going to be up 10% to 15% versus the same time at the end of 2019, which is an indicator we have been watching closely. And inventory level in the field for us ended up only up 7% versus the same time in Q2 of 2019.  And you look at a collection of factors that are driving the strength that we're seeing. Housing starts, it's going to be up 13% or so this year. We are seeing people obviously buying and selling more homes. And one of the things that happens when you buy a home is sometimes you replace the air conditioning system. So I think that's a driver. There's been a lot of talk about work from home, of course, but I think it's -- without being too quantitative about it, it just seems that units are running hotter and longer getting more cycles on them, and that has to be contributing to some of the strength that we're seeing. And we benefited from share gains. I mean we're up -- if you look at the last 12 months, you really can't measure share 1 quarter at a time, but you can look at -- over the last 12 months, our share is up over 200 basis points.  And it's a combination of converting dealers, but also I do believe that our operational performance, even though we have been far from flawless has helped us, albeit, frankly, at a higher cost, but we've gone out of our way to support our customers. So I think, Steve, you put that all together and as we start looking ahead, we want to -- we expect that when we come out of this year, our inventory levels should be in balance. We're going to carefully watch movement. We have announced our third price increase effective September 1 this year, which was really focused on 2022 as we announced that.  And housing starts, we'll have to see how that plays out. The estimates are all over the map, but maybe around that to flattish for right now, but we'll see how that plays out. And then we'll start to see some perhaps early buy because of the 2023 change. So you put that all together, I think we're trying to stay very close to our distributors, keep inventory levels in check and continue to support our customers. Steve Tusa : Is there a chance that you have a down year at any time in the next couple of years? David Gitlin : Well, there's a chance of anything. I mean you know, Steve, it's a short-cycle business and that we're coming off some very -- we're coming off a lot of strength. But right now, we see between the pricing, the underlying factors that we've been seeing, orders have remained strong. I mean we're very well booked not only for 3Q, we're booked into 4Q. And we see that we're very, very well positioned in the high-margin resi business.  And the nice thing with our portfolio is that light commercial remains strong, the applied business, we look at ABI indicators, which give us confidence around the coming months and years around the applied business, aftermarket growth. The whole portfolio, one of the things that I was particularly pleased about for 2Q is that every part of the portfolio showed strength. So working hard in resi, well positioned there. There's a lot of things to like. And then we have the rest of the portfolio that looks positive as well. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then sorry, one more, what were applied orders up in the quarter? David Gitlin : I think 20% or 30%. Let me -- before I answer it, we try to get a cheat sheet to help you here. Patrick Goris : About 30%. David Gitlin : Yes, 30%. Patrick Goris : Right, across all regions, basically. Actually, very strong double digits across all regions, North America, EMEA and China, all up over 20%. Operator : Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Thomas Moll : I want to talk to your incremental margins. If I'm interpreting your guide in the script correctly, it looks like for this year, on a reported basis, we ought to land somewhere between 20% and 25%. But Patrick, I think I hear you saying operationally, you're still high 20s or 30s. So if we could just confirm those. But then also as we look into 2022, is there any reason we shouldn't continue to see that roughly 30% conversion. And then in terms of the operational side. Patrick Goris : Yes, Tommy. So your understanding is correct. So we expect reported conversion to be between 20 and 25 and operational or core conversion to be in the high 20s. And the difference between the 2 is really FX, which is about a 4-point headwind for the full year on conversion. And then the Chigo acquisition, the first year with a lot of revenue and given some of the onetime costs, not a lot of earnings contribution yet.  And so that's really the walk between the low 20s and the high 20s from an earnings conversion point of view. And then, of course, what I'm not taking into account here is that as we raise price just to offset some input costs, that's somewhat of a headwind as well.  For next year, we're really not at a point where we can talk a lot about next year. What I can say is that, and I mentioned this before, we have a really strong focus within all 3 segments in ensuring that we take pricing actions now to offset any material cost and other inflation that we see in our businesses. And so -- if we are successful doing that, and I'm very comfortable with that, then of course, we would expect an earnings conversion next year that would be in line what we do this year. The biggest driver, of course, will be what are the levels of organic growth. And that is not something we're ready to talk about at this point. Thomas Moll : Fair enough. That's helpful. I wanted to follow up on BlueEdge. Good to see the attach rate on chillers up to, I think, over 1/3 in the second quarter. As we move forward from here towards your target of 50%, I think, longer term, what are the levers you're pulling in the business? Is it hiring more sales people? Is it tweaking the incentives for your existing sales force? What are the things you can do to drive that number higher? And then assuming you hit that 50% range at some point in the future, is there any way to frame up what the impact could be in terms of your HVAC growth rate or margin? David Gitlin : Yes, Tommy. Well, look, in terms of the aftermarket, I mean, if you turn the clock back, we were in the 20%. We targeted 30% attachment rate last year, which we achieved. And it was nice to see the attachment rate in 2Q for our chiller business up over 35% in 2Q. And I think it's a combination of what you said. We've added more feet on the street. We've added salespeople. We've added more structure and thought around our IC structure globally. And I think digital enablement is a big factor. You look at providing more prognostics and diagnostics and more digital differentiation is a big factor to create the kind of stickiness with our customers that really help differentiate us. So it's focus and it's those various things.  And then in addition to attachment rate, we're very focused on overall coverage because attachment refers to you sell a chiller, it comes off the warranty period, are we signing a long-term agreement. And our expectation is that we do. So I'd like to get that to 50% as soon as possible, then ultimately, even higher because that's just how we run the business. Our other focus is overall coverage. We talked about going from 50,000 chillers that are covered by a long-term agreement to 60,000.  We're on track to do that. And that goes beyond the initial sale that goes into units that are out in the field that we're converting them to long-term agreements covered by Carrier. So very pleased with the aftermarket growth. We make more money in the aftermarket than we do in the upfront equipment sales. So it will be margin accretive as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : So you highlighted K-12 opportunity in your slide deck. Anything at this point that you can quantify in terms of impact from the stimulus money that's already there. Can you see any discernible impact in the channel on what's going on from the money from the government? David Gitlin : Yes. We're encouraged, Andrew. You look at the stimulus bills that have been passed over the last 18 months, you combine all those together, and there's been $190 billion that's been allocated to school reopenings, that K-12 space. And that is, we expect a real meaningful amount of that to go to HVAC. And what we've done is put a dedicated focus on this effort through a sales force, through incentives, through a lot of structured intensity around making sure that we get our fair share of that. And look, there's 16,000 school districts in the United States. When we look through the year-to-date, our K-12 vertical is up 15% to 20%, and we think it's directly correlated to the additional funding that is in that space.  And I think with this new infrastructure bill, of course, we'll see how that plays out once it goes over to the House, but we expect more money to be allocated to schools. But also when I see infrastructure bills, it actually plays very well for our strategic focus, healthy buildings, especially in school. Sustainability, there's going to be funding in there for things like sustainability for airports, that's exactly in our wheelhouse and then intelligence and our ability to use our Abound system for both healthy and sustainable solutions in things like the schools and in airports, in infrastructure, I think, will be a really good opportunity. So we're encouraged by the infrastructure and the overall stimulus bills. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question. How do you guys think about Carrier 700 program in a highly inflationary environment, right? Because if inflation continues in the next year, sort of the framework becomes less meaningful, right, just because you get penalized for the inflation, which is not really in your control. Have you had the conversation with the Board about maybe changing some of the metrics? Or you think inflation goes away and we are back on track? Patrick Goris : Andrew, what I would say is that in the current environment with higher input costs or in higher inflation, it really only enhances the focus on driving cost out throughout our supply chain, actually, within our ops organization, which was already very focused on driving our cost. We're just setting up a Tiger team, adding additional people to get incremental cost out. And frankly, in addition to that, it just enhances our focus on what we can do on the G&A side as well to get incremental costs out.  And so yes, Carrier 700 is a net number. But I would -- I'll be very clear to say this does not at all negatively influence our focus on it. We're more focused on it than before. Same thing within our manufacturing facilities, a lot of focus on what we can do there also from an automation point of view, given that, as is well documented, we're not the only company that has some challenges with some localized labor. And so I'd say we're comfortable there that the focus will continue. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeffrey Hammond : Just back on commercial, I think you called out light as being up 60%. Can you just talk about what was going on there? And was that just a comp thing? Or -- and then it seems like the applied back is maybe a little longer dated, just how that flows in. David Gitlin : Jeff, light commercial is very encouraging. Clearly, easy comps. But when you're up 60% year-over-year, there's underlying strength there. we see it not only in the warehouse vertical, but it is an indication that things are reopening. You see it in retail, you see in restaurants. And it's clearly been one of the beneficiaries of the spend on K-12.  About half of our spend on K-12 is light commercial, the other half applied. So I think we benefited from that spend. We're also gaining share there as well. We've seen nice share gains probably in a similar range to what we've seen on the residential side over the last 12 months. So the thing that's particularly encouraging about light commercial is that the field inventory levels are in check. They're low despite the strong sales, down only a few percent year-over-year, which means that there's not inventory in the channel. And as demand continues to increase and we continue to go to great lengths to support our customers, we feel quite encouraged by what we're seeing in light commercial right now. Jeffrey Hammond : And then just I think the Chubb decision is a great one. But just kind of thinking about near-term dilution, the thought that between buyback and M&A, you can cover that up eventually? Or do you think there's a transition into '22 where there's a little dilution. Patrick Goris : Yes, the way we're thinking about this, first of all, we have capital available to us. I mentioned the cash on the balance sheet. We mentioned the proceeds. And so we will be focused on putting that capital to work in the best and most strategic way for us. And so think about -- we're looking at the next 12, 18 months that we're focused on redeploying capital. We're not going to get rushed into making any bad decisions or acquisitions that we will regret. But we think about a 12, 18 months' time frame to kind of make that up. Operator : Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Two questions, I think. First, just following up on Steve's question about residential. Do you guys see any evidence of shortened life expectancy of resi HVAC units given kind of the work from home and the high heat the last couple of years. I mean I don't know in your warranty data or elsewhere, have you seen any evidence that the life expectancy has changed materially. David Gitlin : Yes. It would indicate that the life expectancy would be with the fact that units are running -- putting more cycles on them than previously, and I do think that they're running hotter too. So I do think there's clearly indications that the overall life expectancy in terms of the number of years is going to be shorter as you put more cycles on it in a shorter period of time. So we're working internally to dimensionalize that better than we have in the past. So we're doing the data assessment on that. But I think anecdotally, I can tell you with high confidence that the life expectancy does seem to be coming down. Gautam Khanna : Any order of magnitude on how much it may be coming down 20%, 30%? David Gitlin : I'm hesitant to say because when we do say it, I want to make sure that we've gone deep on the data assessment of that. Chris Nelson and Justin Keppy and the team are looking at that. And it really is critical not only so we can answer your question more specifically, but for our planning purposes, we actually -- we came into this year underestimating our demand, and that's driving a lot of -- we're doing a lot of hiring that we didn't anticipate doing.  So we need to get as precise on that answer for you and for ourselves as possible, but I'm hesitant to throw out a number on this call until we've gone deeper on it. But we will be coming back to you on that shortly. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And then just a follow-up on the commercial HVAC demand, up over 20% in aggregate. Any sense for how much of that is sort of a catch-up of deferred replacement last year, if you will, sort of any slice of what's the underlying demand versus a catch-up, if you will. David Gitlin : Well, what I'd say is that what's really encouraging about commercial HVAC is you look at ABI, the Architectural Billing Index, and we did go through a stretch where it was quite well -- quite low, many months where it was below 50, which obviously we want higher than 50 as an indication of strength. And it was 57 in June. It's the fifth straight month that is higher than 50. And I think it's a combination of probably catch up the things that were put on hold and new construction that is now being built in anticipation of the economic momentum we're seeing more globally. We've had some key wins recently and not only things like data centers and warehouses, which generally were strong throughout the pandemic, but commercial office buildings, we've had some nice wins there, both in our HVAC business, but also in our controls business. And of course, in Fire & Security.  So education, health care, commercial buildings, there's a lot of indication that it's pretty broad-based. And one thing that we found particularly encouraging was it wasn't a U.S. phenomenon. Europe, was quite strong. Your orders in Europe were up over 50% in the quarter, and part of that easy comparable part of it is you're seeing some real pent-up demand there. And then, of course, it's not only applied, but our focus on aftermarket, which was up 15% in just HVAC alone in the quarter. So some encouraging signs. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : I'd like to circle back on price cost this quarter for Patrick, some more specifics. I know the policy, the practice is to lock in your input costs as best you can, 100% for the current quarter, but you said you did have to go into the spot market. Was that strictly a function of increased demand above expectations? Or were there any supplier issues in, let's say, steel or copper? Patrick Goris : I would say, Deane, it's really mostly driven by the much stronger demand than we expected. That is the main reason. In addition to that, of course, I would say the -- what we call Tier 2 is playing a role as well. I think some of the component, the electronic components, particularly in our Fire & Security business, and we've seen that as well spot prices as well as some expedited trade. And so that's really the main driver. Deane Dray : Patrick, I'd rather hear you talk about a price increases on those -- or the cost of those components rather than supply issues. So are there any supply chain disruptions on anything electronic printed circuit boards and so forth? Patrick Goris : I would -- clearly, there are some issues, but I would say that they are spotty. We continue to meet customer demand. Are there pockets where we are a little late in some instances? Sure. But by and large, we are managing our supply chain really well, and we are managing customer demand. David Gitlin : What I'd add, Dean, is that I have to give our kudos to the operations team who literally are working around the clock. So we have 24/7 coverage where we have folks spanning both sides of the world managing these challenges.  They're real. They're acute. We came into the year thinking our sales will be up mid-single digits. Now it's going to be up double digits. So what that means from practical terms is that you're adding 2.5 million manufacturing hours, you have to go aggressively hire talent and demand.  In places like Tennessee, we're competing for talent with Amazon and FedEx. So our operations team is dealing with challenges every day on the supply chain labor and really doing a phenomenal job to go to great lengths to support our customers.  So I think we'll get out in front. We're doing a lot of things to make our supply chain more robust, with more automation, more dual sourcing. But it's not for the faint of heart. There's real challenges that the team is addressing every day. Deane Dray : Yes. That's all good to hear. And then second question, Abound has come up a couple times on the call. And I know it's still in a pilot program. But Dave, could you take us through at a high level the economics of the platform, the percent of recurring revenues. And from the industry feedback that we've heard, the competitive advantages really has a lot to do with the open architecture and maybe you can address that as well. David Gitlin : Sure. Thanks, Dean. It's -- for us, Abound is really a long game. It's SaaS-based, so it's all recurring revenues. It's going to be a subscription model. It will be margin accretive. But the real focus of Abound is making indoor air quality visible. So we started with a commercial office building customer outside of the D.C. area. We've had it running in a K-12 school outside of Atlanta. We've gotten great feedback because as people come back to the office, as people go back into -- as people are going back into school in the spring, you can go into the school library and you have a dial that shows you that the air quality is good. And it gives you confidence as you go back into these indoor environment.  So I don't want to oversell like how many we've sold. What it is, is early phases. We've been working with the Atlanta Braves in Truist Park. We have it running in our corporate headquarters in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.  We've had a number of customers, very high-profile customers coming through and really trying to understand it, understand how it works not only for the tenants, but for the building operator. And I think it's going to be transformative.  Early phases, as you said, from a differentiation perspective. It is open architecture. It interfaces with other control systems. So it's not a proprietary that will only work with our ALC controls business. And I think it's one of the key enablers to making the whole focus on healthy and sustainable buildings sticky over the long term. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dean. And maybe before we take the next question, from a modeling perspective, I thought I'd add that we expect for the balance of the year and particularly Q3, we expect Q3 sales and adjusted EPS to be very similar to our Q2 performance. And so that might be helpful as we do the models. Operator : Our next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Appreciate all the details as usual. I wanted to come at the kind of input cost question a little bit differently. I was just curious if your best estimate on when you kind of hit the peak pressure either for ROS or supply chain availability or labor? Just curious if we've already hit it or if you're expecting it in the coming next quarters? Patrick Goris : That is a very good question. And I think the key takeaway that we have as a management team is our need to be able to be flexible and adjust quickly, whether it's from a supply chain management point of view or what is from an ability of passing through prices to our customers to ensure that we remain price/cost neutral.  And so of course, we've seen a tremendous increase in input cost. I mentioned that for the year now, we're sitting at about $250 million of input costs. Early in the year, it was several tens of millions of dollars. And so I'm not ready to call it this is it, we've seen the peak. But what I can tell you is that this is probably one of the most watched items within the company.  We're doing, as we always do. At certain times, we block in positions for commodities for next year. And so that is happening per our practice. And as I mentioned, probably the most important thing is our ability to remain nimble and to flex our supply chain and to pass through pricing. Dave, any..? David Gitlin : Yes. The only thing I'd add, John, is that at the end of the day, we control the controllables. So we are -- that third price increase, you saw it in resi, it's across the portfolio. There's really no part of our portfolio that has not been aggressive, not only announcing price increases, but realizing price increases. And then on the cost side, Patrick said it earlier, but it's across everything that we can control, including G&A, and we've set up this Carrier business services to really have a picture of tetra model as we move stuff to low-cost centers of excellence on the G&A side.  We're being aggressive in the factories, aggressive on supply chain. Look, steel is very high. So we got to keep a close eye, I mean, $600 a ton up to 2000 in the United States. So clearly, we would hope and expect that starts to modulate a bit. And then copper has been hovering. So we've been taking some blocking positions there. I think Patrick and I have become more aware of commodity pricing than we ever thought we would on a daily basis. But we're watching it, and we'll see how things continue to play out. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe just a follow-up. It seems to suggest on the residential side. New homeowners might be using the home purchase event as a way to replace the system before it goes end of life. Curious if on the commercial side, you're seeing any change in behavior from the customer. If they're proactively upgrading systems either for an ESG commitment or for a wellness commitment versus kind of letting everything run to almost a failure before they replace the system? David Gitlin : Yes. I think we're seeing -- and that's one of our biggest focus areas is modernizations and trying to proactively work with customers to replace systems before their end of life. And you can make a business case just on sustainability alone. If you look at the savings you can get and there are some government incentives. But as you move to more sustainable chillers then you can get very significant savings and also help customers hit their own ESG targets. Our customers are no different than us that they've been very public about some form of carbon neutrality, many of them, and we're helping them not only get to their commitments, but help quantify for them how they're getting to their commitments by an early replacement of a chiller and it also ties into healthy. I think light commercial and applied customers are going to great lengths, many of them to put in more healthy solutions. So we're seeing some upselling in healthy solutions there as well. Operator : We are taking our last question from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : So on the Carrier 700, I think a couple of questions have sort of picked around the edges of this. But Patrick, on the 225 kind of going to 150 using your definition of net, you spelled out the incremental price that's in guidance. I think you had $75 million of headwinds in the 225 definition, but an extra $125 million of price. So maybe on more of kind of a double secret net basis, you guys come out ahead. Is there another item we're missing? Or is they are on the more fully netted number, a little more positive? Patrick Goris : Actually, Josh, it's a good question, and I recognize that sometimes it could be a little confusing. The way you can think about it is versus the prior guide Carrier 700, as I mentioned, is worse by $75 million. That's mostly input cost on the material side. In addition to that, which is not part of Carrier 700, we have additional plant inefficiencies, actually inefficiencies from last year from COVID that we thought would get better and they're not getting better or not -- they're not getting better to the extent that we expected. That's $25 million in addition to the $75 million. And then the other part of this $25 million of higher inbound freight costs, including air freight. That gets you to $125 million offset by the $125 million in price.  And so there is no net benefit. Of course, the objective is as we catch up price/cost that going forward, we're nowhere soft and it becomes a little accretive. But for this year, it is a net zero. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Got it. That's helpful. I appreciate that detail. And then just on resi, maybe a finer point question but hard not to notice that the comp does get almost 60 points harder 2Q to 3Q. So any commentary you guys can give us on how July ended up, I think, would be helpful in calibrating that. David Gitlin : Go ahead. Patrick Goris : Look, July has continued where June left off. So we're very well booked for 3Q. I mean obviously, as you get into 3Q, the orders compares, you would expect them to be down year-over-year, but you're still seeing healthy order rates if you look at versus historical levels. So right now, we feel certainly balanced in our guidance for Q3.  I mean, remember, we had been saying that we thought the first half would be up 30, second half down 20. What we're now saying is that the first half was up a lot more than we thought. And the second half is probably down closer to 5% to 10% year-over-year.  So we're keeping a close eye on it. The #1 thing we keep watching is movement and the movement continues to be very strong from our distributors to our dealers. So we'll keep a close eye on that, and we're working distributor by distributor to make sure that we're managing with them in a very collaborative way their inventory levels. Operator : I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dave Gitlin for closing remarks. David Gitlin : Okay. Well, listen, thank you all for joining. I appreciate you accommodating the earlier start time and of course, Sam is available for questions. Thank you all. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com.  I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer.  Except as otherwise noted, the Company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-recurring and/or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items. The Company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other Forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. This morning we'll review our financial results for the third quarter and discuss the full-year 2021 outlook. We'll leave time for questions at the end. Once the call is opened up for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to give everyone the opportunity to participate. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our Q3 results on Slide 2. Q3 was another strong quarter for us, particularly in light of the widespread supply chain challenges. Our growth continues to benefit from our ability to leverage broad economic momentum, our position at the epicenter of important secular trends, and our strategic investments and execution on our growth initiatives.  Demand and orders remain encouraging. We are experiencing record backlogs, positioning us well for continued growth in Q4 and 2022. Our key challenge remains operational, both in mitigating the continued inflationary headwind and supporting customer demand. I will provide more details on the next slide, but I want to thank our team who has been working tirelessly to support our customers and I also want to thank our customers and suppliers who continue to partner with us as we address these issues.  You see the efforts of the team reflected in our Q3 results. Organic sales were up 4% over Q3 of last year and up 7% over Q3 of 2019. Adjusted EPS of $0.71 was better than we anticipated, helped by a lower tax rate.  Given the rising input cost headwinds, we have been aggressive on price and controllable costs while preserving investments critical to differentiation and growth. Our HVAC team more effectively manage price cost and that was reflected in a segment margin of 19.1%. Our fire and security team also reacted aggressively, but it is our business that is most impacted by chip shortages.  The refrigeration story is mixed. While the segment drove solid 14% organic growth and continued to gain traction on strategic initiatives, we did not react aggressively enough on both price and costs, resulting in disappointing segment margins.  I am confident that Tim and the team are taking the right actions to position us well for 2022. All in all, this is shaping up to be a strong year for Carrier. We are raising our top line expectations from 10% to 12% organic growth to about 13% over last year, indeed up 6% over 2019.  We are also raising adjusted EPS range to the high end of what we previously indicated, now projecting approximately $2.20, up 33% over last year. Despite inflationary challenges, we remain on track to deliver over 70 basis points of margin expansion this year while generating about $1.9 billion in free cash flow. Turning to Slide 3. The supply chain challenges are significant. Between raw material escalation, supplier price increases, chip shortages and logistics costs, full-year input cost pressure has now increased from about $250 million in our July forecast to about $375 million. We are tackling this situation both tactically and strategically.  Tactically, we have a virtual global supply chain war room that operates 24 hours a day. We have devoted significant additional resources into supply chain management, many of whom are on-site at our suppliers. We have redirected ocean freight routes to avoid extended port delays using a newly implemented digital tool.  Strategically, we are taking actions to emerge from this period with a more resilient supply chain. For example, we are working to minimize single points of failure. 2020 had roughly 25% dual sourcing of critical components.  We will end 2021 with over 35%, we are targeting 75%. Integrated circuits have our acute focus and we're working directly with our chip OEMs on securing supply. We are also localizing certain commodities to remain low-cost and reduce logistics cost and complexity. We have increased our investments in automation by 50% this year.  We will have more than 3 million automated manufacturing hours by the end of this year, and we have a plan to have 6 million by the end of 2026. Our investments in digital tools provide better visibility and drive more proactive actions across our factories and supply chain, and we are deploying Carrier excellence to drive productivity. For 2022, we expect inflationary headwinds at a minimum to be offset by the price increases that we have already implemented and others that we will be announcing by the end of this year. Equally important is our focus on managing the controllables on the cost side, including G&A. We remain committed to investing and playing offense on growth and you see our progress on Slide 4. Our North Star remains consistent to be the world leader in healthy, safe, sustainable, and intelligent building in cold chain solutions.  In Healthy Buildings, we have over 350 million in orders and a pipeline of over 550 million ahead of our full-year expectations. We continue to see strong traction in key verticals, including K-12 with a pipeline that is 30% higher than Q2. We are very well-positioned to address our customers\u2019 sustainability needs. Over 30% of our residential heating sales in North America are now heat pumps.  We were honored to win a prestigious innovation award at the recent AHR Expo for our Infinity 24 heat pump with Greenspeed intelligence, the industry's most advanced heat pump with premium energy efficiency. Globally, 33% of commercial heating sales are now heat pumps, up from 15% five years ago, and we project this to be 50% within five years. We plan to capture more than our fair share by driving differentiation. For example, earlier this year, we launched our new air-cooled chiller heat pump platform in Europe. It's global warming potential is 70% lower than our previous chiller and improves our customers\u2019 energy efficiency by up to 30% versus legacy technologies.  Our chiller and heat pump sales for this platform were up 30% year-over-year through Q3, contributing to share gains. On Abound, it is the connective tissue for intelligent connected buildings. For example, I recently visited it with Dr. Scott Boden from Emory at his newly opened state-of-the-art healthcare facility.  Carrier and Emory are innovation partners in this healthy, intelligent, and sustainable facility with the full suite of Carrier technology, HVAC, building automation systems, fire detection, access and video management, digital solutions, and abound which ties it all together.  Our progress on Lynx is equally encouraging. Our truck trailer and shipping fleet customers are increasingly adopting our subscription-based connected fleet monitoring digital solutions. We have seen mid-teen growth in our subscription portfolio year-to-date and we have a strong order book and pipeline.  We recently signed an agreement with one of the largest refrigerated truck fleets in the United States to provide subscription-based telematics and refer fleet monitoring. The customer will benefit from increased efficiencies, less downtime, and loss products and overall lower energy consumption and costs.  We continue to see progress on our three pillars of growth with share gains, VRF expanded geographic coverage and increased digitally-enabled aftermarket and recurring revenues, which I will discuss more on Slide 5. Q3 aftermarket revenues were up about 12% year-over-year and we are tracking to double-digit aftermarket growth this year. We have launched a broad portfolio of aftermarket solutions, including spare parts, preventative maintenance, break fixed repairs, midlife modifications and upgrades, remote monitoring and other digital services.  Digital enablement is foundational. In addition to abound, we recently launched Breeze, a new e-commerce platform focused on capturing high-margin part sales with our National Account customers in residential and light commercial HVAC.  Our service coverage levels are at all-time highs. In commercial HVAC, we remain on track to have 60,000 chillers under service contracts this year. In refrigeration, we signed a three-year BluEdge service contract with ScottsRL, Australia's largest national refrigerated transport fleet.  Tangible progress on these strategies is driving strong organic growth in 2021 and positions us well for continued top-line sticky growth in 2022 and beyond. Another component of our growth is acquisitions.  As you can see on slide 6, we are making great progress in this area as well. Our strong balance sheet enables us to play offense on capital deployment, including M&A, both focusing on digitally enabled recurring revenues. For example, nLight is complementary to our ALC building management system offerings in the fast-growing data center vertical. nLight software optimizes rack loads and monitors power and heat generation. ALC has market-leading technology which automates the cooling systems to effectively and efficiently dissipate that generated heat.  Together we provide an integrated solution to monitor and control both the power and the cooling systems to optimize data center operations. Similarly, BrokerBay is complementary to our Supra business. Supra leverages the mobile credentialing capabilities used across our broad security portfolio to give us high-market share and locks that support residential real estate showings, enabling 45 million property showings in 2020. Agents love our technology and have been pushing for more digital offerings such as scheduling, real-time communication, and actionable insights.  BrokerBay, brings a highly differentiated real estate management cloud ecosystem that adds the sought-after capabilities. Together, we provide a one-stop shop to improve agent productivity. Early customer response has been tremendous. Last week, we announced the acquisition of Denmark-based Cavius, an innovative residential alarm Company.  Cavius has a complete range of smoke, heat, flood, and carbon monoxide alarms, including the world's smallest photoelectric smoke alarm. In combination with Kidde, we can further enhance our innovative, residential fire safety product offerings and strengthen our connected technologies innovation pipeline globally.  The market opportunity is very attractive as fire safety regulations expand across the globe. We continue to build out our M&A pipeline and we will remain focused on our strategic priorities. With that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave. And good morning, everyone. I'll start with comments about the quarter and provide details on our outlook. Please turn to Slide 7. As expected, the results were very similar to Q2. Price realization was better-than-expected, but that was offset by higher-than-expected input costs.  All segments were on track to over-deliver on top-line growth, but increasing supply chain constraints impacted availability and lead to shipment delays, and contributed to record backlogs. Sales of $5.3 billion were up about 7% compared to last year. Currency was 1-point tailwind for sales in the quarter and acquisitions, mainly GE added another two points of growth. Given the unusually strong residential HVAC performance last year, this quarter had a more challenging comparison.  Nonetheless, we delivered organic sales growth of 4%. Adjusted operating margin of 16.1% was down about 120 basis points compared to last year but was up about a 100 basis points from the second quarter on lower sales. The year-over-year margin decline was impacted by the absence of last year's cost containment activities. As expected, price cost was modestly negative in the quarter.  I'll address our outlook for the balance of the year with respect to price and costs in a few slides but I'll share that we plan additional pricing actions to offset rising inflationary pressures throughout our supply chain. Some of these price increases were announced earlier this week, including up to double-digit price increases in our residential and light commercial HVAC businesses in North America.  Fire & Security and Refrigeration are also planning additional price increases. Free cash flow was $505 million in the quarter and $1.1 billion through 9 months. Inventories are higher than expected as we incur shipping delays given component shortages.  Last year, Q3 benefited from timing around payables which did not recur this year. Finally, we repurchased about 2.7 million shares in the quarter for a $146 million and we remain on track to repurchase about 10 million shares this year.  In the appendix, we included the year-over-year Q3 adjusted EPS bridge, summarizing many of the points I just discussed. You will note that Q3 operational performance reflected the impact of the absence of last year's temporary cost containment actions and benefited from $0.05 in discrete tax items not included in our July guidance. This benefit is separate from the tax charge of $136 million included in GAAP earnings. In essence, we're in the process of some legal entity reorganization to enable the pending Chubb sale, triggering tax liabilities.  On our balance sheet, you will note that Chubb 's assets and liabilities have now been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale. As previously communicated, we still expect to net about $2.6 billion of cash from the sale of Chubb. As to timing, we currently estimate the transaction to close in December or January. Let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on Slide 8. HVAC organic sales were up about 2% in the quarter, including the better-than-expected 2% decline in residential HVAC, given the tough compares. Distributor movement was up about 3% over an exceptionally strong quarter last year.  The result is that residential field inventories were down high single-digits sequentially from the end of Q2. The North American light commercial business continued the growth we saw on the second quarter at 14% versus last year. Distributor movement was about 9% and light commercial field inventory levels are now down about 11% year-over-year. Overall, commercial HVAC sales were up about 4% organically.  As expected, HVAC margins were down about a 160-basis points year-over-year, driven by the tough residential comparison, last year's benefit from the temporary cost actions, and the impact of additional pricing to offset cost inflation. Margins were up about 40 bips from the second quarter and the segment remains on track to generate about 16% adjusted operating margin this year. Moving to Refrigeration on slide 9. Sales were up 14% organically as the growth in transport demand continued. Transport refrigeration was up about 24% in the quarter, with very strong growth in both global truck trailer and container. Our Sensitech business continued to benefit from the vaccine rollout and was up about 20% in the quarter. Commercial refrigeration was slightly down year-over-year due to a mid-single-digit decline in China.  Margins were up about 40 bips in the quarter compared to last year as the benefit from higher sales was offset by substantial supply chain and labor challenges, the timing of price increases, as well as last year benefiting from temporary actions. We continue to incur higher costs to meet customer demand in this segment.  As they've mentioned, we're disappointed in the margin performance in this segment and we now expect 2021 operating margin to be in the mid-12% range, lower than we previously expected. Moving on to slide 10. Organic sales for the Fire & Security segment grew above 2%, as products were up about 3% while field was flat.  Within the product business, which represents about 60% of the segment sales, residential fire was down slightly while commercial fire was up. Access solutions and industrial fire were both up high-single-digits. Operating margins were down about 100 bps compared to last year, as last year benefited from the temporary cost actions.  Margins were up 240 basis points sequentially, and we continue to expect overall margins for this segment to be in the mid [Indiscernible] for the year. Now let me review the order activity we saw in the third quarter on Slide 11. As you can see, our residential and light commercial orders remain positive despite the very strong third quarter last year. Within that business, orders were down in residential in the high single-digits on tough comparisons. but light commercial orders were up over 40% as the recovery in that business continues. Backlog and residential is up sequentially and remains some 70% or so higher than at this point the last year.  Commercial HVAC orders were up about 12% compared to last year and backlog increased about 5% sequentially and about 20% year-over-year. For Refrigeration, order activity for the global truck trailer business remains solid and up about 15% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in Europe. The order intake and backlogs exiting Q3 continued to position the Refrigeration segment to achieve the expected high-teens organic sales growth for the year. Order intake for Fire & Security segment also remained strong. Product orders were up 10% year-over-year with strong double-digit growth in access solutions and industrial fire.  Field orders were up mid to high single-digits organically. On the right, you can see that orders are up in all geographies except in China. In China, HVAC orders were up in the mid-single digits, while orders in refrigeration and fire and security were down in the double-digits. Let's move to slide 12, updated outlook. To reiterate what we said the last quarter, we are including Chubb in the outlook until the transaction closes.  Based on our Q3 performance, price realization and higher backlogs, we now expect organic sales to be up about 13% for the year, which is higher than our prior 10% to 12% outlook.  The benefit of higher organic sales is offset by higher input costs. We now expect to exit 2021, with price costs being neutral in Q4 versus our prior guide of positive price cost in Q4. We continue to expect an adjusted operating margin of a little over 13.5%. Full-year incremental investments are expected to be about $150 million consistent with prior guidance.  The Q3 discrete tax benefit of $0.05 carries over, so this all leads to an update d 2021 adjusted EPS outlook of about $2.20. As you build your models, note that Chubb represents about $0.24 of the 2021 annual earnings, including the non-cash pension income. Also, if we thought 2021 outlook would be above $2.20, we would have included that in a range. We continue to expect free cash flow to be about $1.9 billion. Slide 13 shows the bridge from the midpoint of our prior guidance to the current guidance.  As you can see, the biggest driver is the lower-than-expected adjusted tax rate, as higher volume is offset by price costs. Just a note about the fourth quarter, we expect incremental investments this year to mostly offset the benefit of the absence of $0.04 of unusual items in the last -- in last year's fourth quarter. In closing, the first 9 months of the year were strong with double-digit organic growth and 35% adjusted EPS growth.  Thank you all. Thank you to all of our colleagues and partners managing and supporting strong demand in a very challenging supply chain environment. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for Slide 14. David Gitlin : Thanks, Patrick. We are very pleased with our performance as we are now 3 quarters of the way through 2021, and we remain confident in our team's ability to navigate supply chain challenges to support our customers and drive continued results in the fourth quarter and beyond. With that, we'll open this up for questions. Operator : And thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question is going to come from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. Can you hear me? David Gitlin : Yeah, Andy. Good morning. Andrew Obin : Yeah. Good morning. Just a question on just sort of philosophical approach to Carrier 700 in this inflationary environment, right, because you're actually are putting numbers, but sort of the optics of it seems like you're missing your targets despite the fact that your pricing is very, very strong. So how do you guys think about maybe changing the framework here to change incentives, right? Because clearly, it seems that this plan was designed for low inflation/deflationary environment and we're in a very, very different world. What are the thoughts? What are the management and the Board thoughts about it? David Gitlin : Yeah, Andrew, thanks. And let me start and Patrick and add. You're absolutely right. Carrier 700 is an all-in number. And what happened last year is that it was such a unique year where you had some one-time cost takeouts that we were doing with furloughs and other things and some one-time benefits we were doing seizing on the productivity side. And it got a bit tortured as we went through last year into this year, which is what we're seeing as sort of inflationary pressures that we haven't seen in a few decades.  So, what we've really fixated on as an organization is doing everything we can to make sure that we are price-cost positive, which means aggressively pricing as much as we can, and also being -- controlling the controllables on all things that are related to cost. So, we are doing a lot with Carrier Alliance, we're driving productivity, we're managing commodities as best we can. So our focus as an organization is doing everything we can to make sure that in this very unique environment, we stay price cost positive.  So we still mentioned where the Carrier 700 number is to make sure that we didn't lose that thread. But as we go into next year, obviously, Chubb will be gone, which will form a bit of a reset, and then we have to kind of step back and look at where we are.  The underlying principle of Carrier 700 and having 56,000 people around the world focused every day on making sure that we control -- everything we can control on the cost side is still there and it will never stop. What we'll do in our February 22nd Investor Day is kind of give some context on where that is to reframe it going forward. But the underlying D&A of cost takeout will always be a part of Carrier. Andrew Obin : Thank you. And then just a question about thinking about connection between orders and sales into next year, because I think this year has been very different in terms of how long the sales season was, right, the strength of the orders to comps.  So how should we think about what the existing backlog and order rates in September, October? What's the early indication for 2022, given how unusual '21 was, specifically on HVAC? David Gitlin : Yes. I think if you look broadly, Andrew, the backlog almost across the portfolio is at record highs. So we feel very, very good about where we are in terms of our order, our sales forecast for the rest of this year.  And as we start thinking about next year, we're more booked now for early next year than we normally would be at this time, given the record backlogs. If you think about our residential backlogs, we're up 40% in terms of our backlog sequentially, we're up 70% year-over-year.  So, we're at very high level of bookings. Our challenge is making sure that we continue to keep up with the demand, but we feel very, very encouraged by our backlog positions pretty much across the portfolio. Andrew Obin : Thank you very much. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : And thank you. And our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. David Gitlin : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, I\u2019d like to start with light commercial HVAC that 40%-plus orders really does standout. Just talk about the drivers, how much of this might be catch-up? Is it easy COVID comps, but is it part of an underlying rebound in non-resi construction? That'd be helpful. Thanks. David Gitlin : Well \u2013 yes, I mean, clearly the comps are a bit easy compared to last year, but there's just a lot of strength. What we had said when we were forecasting like commercial coming into this year, as we reminded people that it's 80% replacement, 20% new. So there was a lot of pent-up demand coming out of last year. Some of the key verticals that have been strong all year continue to be strong. We see a lot of demand in places like warehouse. K-12 has been extremely encouraging. We have a whole dedicated focus on making sure that we support that vertical. Retail restaurants are coming back online and we gained share. It looks to us like we gained 300 basis points of share year-to-date in light commercial. And I think part of that is driven by our ability to support the customer. It hasn't been without input cost pressures, but we've gone to great lengths to make sure that we can support our customers.  So, when you look at all the different variables, order is up more than 40% year-over-year, when we look at the quarter. Field inventory is down significantly, which bodes well for the future. Our backlog is up sequentially. It's up almost 3x over 2020 and movement from our distributors into our end-customer base remains in the double-digit range. And we just announced a price increase of up to 12%. So, a lot to like in light commercial. Deane Dray : Got it. And then as a follow-up, can you comment on China? It looked like HVAC was a bit better, but it certainly overall, you bear more pressures and just give us a sense of what the demand is, any operating conditions that you would comment on? David Gitlin : China orders for HVAC were up in that mid-single-digit range. The rest of the portfolio did see some orders challenges. So the one watch area, given the Evergrande attention would have been commercial HVAC and what we're still seeing there is some orders tailwinds.  I think -- look, the good news is that China is a very strategic important market for us. It's 8% of our sales and we continue over the long-term to lean into China. We want to be in China for China. And it's a very strategic market for us over the long-term. If you look at the Evergrande situation, that seems to be most acutely impacted in some of the Tier 3, Tier 4 cities focused on multi-family residential, which is for us is a very, very small percent of Carrier sales. It's probably 0.5% of our sales that specific area.  So, I think we're well [Technical Difficulty] and well calibrated on some of those issues. Overall, when you look at China, real estate is a very important part of China. So, I do think the government is going to be incentivized to support that industry, the overall real estate industry. But we feel overall very well-positioned in China. Deane Dray : That's real helpful. Thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to focus on the HVAC segment and just a bit more clarity on your outlook for a residential HVAC in North America. I think you'd mentioned the sales are down very slightly in Q3, the orders down a little bit more.  Maybe help us understand how you're thinking about that business for the next couple of quarters, how comfortable you feel with the inventory levels in the distribution channel, and the degree of your concerns around any sort of major step down in that market coming up? David Gitlin : Well, Julian Residential HVAC in North America continues to be encouraging for us. We did say that, Resi was down a couple of percent in the quarter, which was less than what we thought. We had previously thought it would be down in the 5% to 10% range. What it really means for us is that the second half is going to end up being probably up low single-digits and we previously thought the second half for us was going to be down 5 to 10.  The good news is that movement continues to be positive. Field inventories, Patrick mentioned sequentially was actually down 7% versus Q2 and even splits are down versus prior year. And our backlog, as I mentioned to Andrew, is up significantly over the last quarter and even more significantly over previous years.  Look, when we look at orders, there's some -- going to be some tough comps in the third quarter. We look at October, orders continued to be strong and all the underlying fundamentals with new housing starts this year is in the +13% range year-over-year.  I think for the home builders there's going to be some push out into next year given some of the supply chain challenges that they and like the rest of us are seeing. But the work from home phenomenon units having a slightly shorter life.  A lot of those underlying factors continue to give us some confidence as we go into next year. So, when we get into February, we will give more specificity. But for right now, a lot of the underlying factors that have been supporting the demand continue. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then just my second question. David Gitlin : I apologize, Julian. And look what it means for the full year is that we had said that we thought resi was going to be up low teens. We're now looking at it being up high teens. I know that it does naturally when you are in that range trigger questions about comps. But again, the -- and we 'll be very cognizant.  We work extremely closely with our distributors to keep inventory levels in balance with them. But I think as we go in the next year, a lot of those encouraging signs that have been supporting us continue to be there. Julian Mitchell : That's great. And then maybe on refrigeration, you'd called out sluggish price increase and that helped drive that disappointing margin performance.  Maybe help us understand how quickly you think you can catch up on that price cost aspects and in particular, how you're managing in transport refrigeration, where you've got extremely volatile orders and builds numbers in the market right now. Patrick Goris : Yeah, Julian, Patrick here. So first of all, there are good things happening within that segment. So, you noticed the very strong sales growth, double-digit growth in transport, CCR, commercial refrigeration was about flat. But as we mentioned, the margin performance is disappointing given the strong sales growth.  And so, focus in that segment now is a closer, a better control on the cost side, but also and I would say especially being more aggressive and timelier on price increases. You mentioned that we have significant backlogs there. Those started at the end of last year that has given us somewhat limited ability to pass on pricing. but that is changing now.  And so, as that window opens up, and as we take on orders for next year, we are ensuring that one, the process for these orders are higher, and two, that we retain the flexibility for these orders to adjust pricing if raw material prices change. And so, it's a significant focus for Tim White and the team. Julian Mitchell : Perfect. Thanks. David Gitlin : Thanks, Julian. Operator : And thank you. And our next one, next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. David Gitlin : Good morning. Nigel Coe : Interesting times. So very strong performance in light commercial plus 14% revenue, and obviously, very strong orders. We haven't got a whole lot of detail on the market right now. But when you compare that, it had a much weaker trends, the supply chain. I'm just wondering if there was some share shift around the quarter.  Any context there would be good. And then within applied, that seems to be a little bit weaker than the first half run rate. Maybe I'm wrong there, but any color on applied trends by market. David Gitlin : When we look at Light Commercial, it's hard to look at share in just a quarter, but year-to-date, we do think that we've gained 300 bips of share. So that can swing, of course. We're not spiking any balls, but we do think that we've gained share in Light Commercial.  It's a very core strategic market for us and we continue -- we will continue to lean in with new products and working with our distributor base and really making sure that that's a market that we go aggressively after.  With commercial HVAC, look, there's a lot of encouraging signs there as well. ABI it's been higher than the architectural billing index. It's been higher than 50 now for 8 consecutive months. Patrick mentioned that overall, we were up mid-single-digits.  North America was in line with that. Europe was a bit higher. China was a bit higher. Orders were up over 10% for commercial HVAC. And a really important thing for us is we really like our ALC controls business.  That was up very strong. Those sales were up in the high-teens, high-margin, very differentiated, important business. And aftermarket has been very thematic for us and we grew double digits there. We're encouraged by commercial HVAC.  Overall, when you look at just equipment applied orders, those were up 15%. our key focus for HVAC, like the rest of the portfolio, keep driving orders and then turn the world upside down to make sure we can deliver. Andrew Obin : Thanks, Dave. And then on the residential, what kind of reaction are you getting from pricing pieces? How much of that headline price increase do you think will stick? And as we go into next year, what price increase? Well, are you planning another pricing? So, assume you offer Jan 1, and what kind of price premises or price range do you think will stick for 2022? And is that enough to offset the [Indiscernible] in patient? David Gitlin : I think the short answer is yes, we announced actually earlier this week that we would have a price increase effective January 1 of up to 10% for resi. We're seeing realization in the range of 6% last quarter. We probably will see about the same number this quarter, which is higher than historical price realization.  These conversations are always difficult, the earlier question on transport, but we have to have these direct discussions with our direct and end customers because of the inflationary pressures we're seeing. So, we're very encouraged by the price stickiness we've seen this year.  I would say the resi business has been the most effective within Carrier at ensuring that we try to stay out in front on these prices -- price increases. And I think that will bode well for us as we go into next year. Nigel Coe : Great, thanks very much. Patrick Goris : Thanks, Nigel. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski, from Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Yes. Can you hear me? David Gitlin : Yes. Patrick Goris : Yes. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Yeah, I guess so. First question, Patrick, you were probably one of the earlier ones out there in the industrial talking about the reset or wrapped around inflation into the first quarter of next year that you have contracts and other kind of locked in buys that will reset.  Do you feel like you have enough price out there right now as we flip over the line into '22 to cover that in the first quarter? It sounds like you're okay in 4Q, but you've already made mentioned that that'll mechanically go higher sequentially. Patrick Goris : Josh, good morning. I'll talk about our current thoughts about 2022 rather than being quarter-specific. But for planning purposes, we're actually including additional price increases to address the continued input cost headwinds, and the hedges that are rolling off from which we benefited last year.  As Dave mentioned, just in HVAC this week, we've announced price increases of up to 12% in residential and light commercial. I think it is safe to say that we're assuming input cost headwinds next year that exceeded the $375 million we're seeing this year.  And so, I think Dave mentioned in his comments that total headwinds this year are above $375 million input costs. So, we expect it to be more than that next year. If I look at the carryover of the pricing actions that we have taken this year.  The carryover is about 350 to $400 million that excludes the additional price increases that we've announced this week in that -- for RESI and light commercial and excludes additional price increases that we will be announcing and implementing in the remainder of our businesses.  And so, from an overall perspective, our goal remains for 2022 to be at least price cost neutral. Of course, we want to do better than that. But the key takeaway for our team is in this environment, we need to be very agile and be able to react quickly on what input costs are doing. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then on the commercial business, Dave, appreciate the commentary on the earlier question there. I guess orders earlier in the year were pretty strong. I get comps are a factor. Anything that would've held back the quarter delivery-wise or order-wise, like a project getting pushed out or supply chain making delivery a little tougher. Just wondering how we square up the order commentary with the sales growth this quarter. David Gitlin : Yeah Josh, we do continue to see some supply chain challenges affecting some of the output. I would say that if you look at our Charlotte facility, which does a lot of the production for our Commercial HVAC business here in North America, we had some initial issues about a year ago that we then address.  And just as we were coming out of those 3PL related type issues, we then ran into a bunch of supply chain issues. So, our sales could have clearly been higher in the quarter if we didn't have that.  We're working closely with our customers to make sure that they know what they're going to get when, but order's strong, it's one of the factories that we would expect to start to recover as the supply chain issues from their tier-1 start to recover. Josh Pokrzywinski : That is helpful. Thanks, guys. Best of luck. David Gitlin : Thank you. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Josh. Operator : And thank you. And our next question come from Joe Ritchie, from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. David Gitlin : Hey, Joe. Patrick Goris : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : I know we've talked a lot about price cost and touched on Carrier 700, but just to make sure we've got this straight for next year, Carrier 700 hasn't included the pricing increases. And so, is the way to think about the benefits we should expect next year, I think is being somewhat below the 225 I think that we were originally expecting but more than offset by these pricing increases that you're taking through the rest of your organization? Patrick Goris : Yeah, I think, Joe, that the easiest way to think about this is a debt from a price -- overall price cost point of view. And that explains some of the pricing actions we announced this week and we 'll be announcing over the coming weeks. Their intention is to be neutral in worst-case. And so -- and that would include anything we do in the Carrier 700.  And as Dave mentioned earlier in this first question -- the first question from Andrew is, however, we measure Carrier 700 gross or net, the most important thing is that the entire organization is focused on continuously to drive out costs and driving efficiencies to help offset any input cost increases, such as merit or inflation. And enabled us, of course, to continue to invest in our business long term. David Gitlin : What I would add Joe, is that I think the good news is we're going into next year with eyes wide open on the inflationary pressures. And I think our team is pricing accordingly. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful. And I guess the other question is clearly with Chubb coming out, you're going to have some proceeds to put capital to use, just any updated thoughts on your priorities for use of cash and offsetting some of the dilution associated with Chubb next year. Patrick Goris : Yes, Joe, I would say very completely consistent what we mentioned in the last quarter. Our first priority, fund organic growth, then to fund inorganic growth, a -- then funding a growing and sustainable dividend, and then returning cash through shareholders through share repurchase.  What we mentioned the last quarter with the proceeds, one, we expect to pay down about $750 million of debt that's prorated from a capital structure point-of-view with the EBITDA we lose from Chubb.  But we've also said last quarter, we announced a share repurchase authorization of about $1.75 billion. We still expect to buy about 10 million shares this year. And with that, would leave us at the end of this year, will leave us with about $1.6 billion of authorization remaining at the end of this calendar year.  And what we've said from a repurchase point-of-view, is that we would redeploy this over 12 to 18 months so would share repurchases. So that gives you an idea of the sequence for the share repurchases. But of course, as I mentioned, priority number 1, its funding growth, including inorganic growth. And obviously, we have significant capital that we can put to work.  And that's why we have the growing pipeline of acquisitions. We've made some acquisitions this year. We covered them in some of the slides. But there are some acquisitions that are a little bit larger in size in the pipeline as well. And so, we're working hard on getting some of these onboard. Patrick Goris : [Indiscernible], anything? Patrick Goris : Very helpful, thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Tommy Moll from Stephens. Your line is now open. Tommy Moll : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. David Gitlin : Hey, Tommy. Tommy Moll : Appreciate all the commentary around price cost, Carrier 700, etc. If we boil it all down for 2022, is high 20s still a fair aspiration to think about for a core conversion. And then if you think about, sometimes we talk about core operational versus what's actually going to be reported in the P&L.  Any big delta between those two that you would want to make sure to point out for folks, obviously, the Chubb divestiture would be one, but anything else you want to make sure to point out today? Patrick Goris : Yes, Tommy Patrick here. I understand there lots of moving pieces and conversion. And this year, particularly what's playing an important role is one, some of the acquisitions we've made that in year one, don't contribute.  I get us much earnings two the impact of currency and then of course, an important element this year is the whole price cost dynamic, where we're adding this year pricing of well over $300 million for the full year. Yet that is not falling through the bottom line.  Of course, it has a negative impact on our conversion number. That being said, for next year, and I'm going to exclude any significant changes in mix because we don't want to get into that good or bad. But from an operational point of view, we absolutely would still target earnings conversion and at the high 20% to above 30% range.  Depending on what we do on the acquisition side, depending on price costs, that might be slightly different. But operationally, that's absolutely something that we target and work towards. No change. Tommy Moll : Great. Thank you, Patrick. Patrick Goris : Thanks, Tom. Tommy Moll : Dave, I wanted to follow up, a big picture question here. You've moved quickly as a pure play on a lot of fronts. I'm curious, what's the body of big body of work that remains in front of you maybe for next year just in terms of changes you envision making to the business with that pure-play flexibility? G&A transformation or process improvement is one area that comes to mind. But what are some of the big priorities in your mind at this point? David Gitlin : Tommy, we continue to stick with the playbook that we laid out at our February 10th, Investor Day of last year. We said that we would invest in growth. And this year, despite all the input cost challenges, we're going to continue to invest a 150 million in growth along the lines of our three pillars of growth.  Continue to grow the core and continue to look at adjacencies like VRF and geographic expansion like you saw with caveats and then continue to really lean into recurring revenues aftermarket digital.  We're in the first ending on that journey. We have a long way to go with our aftermarket growth and recurring revenues, and that will be very thematic for us. certainly, going into next year and for years to come. We said that we would be super aggressive on costs and despite the fact that the Carrier 700 number itself is what it is, the focus on costs within the organization. G&A transformation is a major theme for us.  We've set up these global centers of excellence. We're going to be pushing more and more work into these low-cost centers of excellence, more G&A reductions. Simplification across the portfolio that will continue to be. And we've gone from 10 billion of net debt when we spun to now will end it after we sell Chubb to closer to 4 billion of net debt. So, our ability to play offense in organic and inorganic growth, is in a great place. So, we'll continue to look at where we can really complement our existing portfolio to play off.  And so, we like our playbook, we like our focus. What we have to do is now transitioned from doing what we said we were going to do, to doing best-in-class in everything we do. And that's going to be our focus in '22 and beyond. Tommy Moll : Thanks Dave. I appreciate it, and I'll turn it back. David Gitlin : Thanks Tommy. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Patrick Goris : Hi, Mr. Tusa. Steve Tusa : I understand getting Josh wrong. But [Indiscernible] Patrick Goris : Yes. Steve Tusa : So just on the realized price in the quarter, what -- was that for total [Indiscernible] on an absolute basis? Patrick Goris : You can think of pricing, Steve, about a $125 million in Q3, significantly better than Q2, growing to about 150 in Q4. And so, from a price realization point-of-view, you'll recall because you asked me the question, and after Q1, we started from less than half a point.  In Q2, we're above 2 points, give or take, and in Q4, will be between 3% and 4% of overall Company price realization. We're seeing it pick up, but, of course, we've been at -- trailing a little bit of the input cost increases. But in Q4, we do expect price cost to be neutral -- Steve Tusa : Right. Patrick Goris : -- so, it is clearly picking up. Steve Tusa : And I had RESI around 65, $70 million of that. Patrick Goris : Do we -- can think about RESI for both Q3 and Q4, about 6% realized. We did that in Q3, we expect the same in Q4. I don't know the exact dollar amount, but that's what we realized in RESI. Steve. Steve Tusa : Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then just try to parse this out a little more for -- to follow up on Joe's question. I mean, there was a pretty big number next year of carryover cost savings, if you will, in couple $100 million, at least. Are you now saying that's like -- that's not -- because of everything that's happened, it's still kind of a cultural mission statement, Carrier 700? But as far as the bridge is concerned, it's kind of been blown up by a lot of this stuff and that we just really shouldn't dial in that kind of -- those kinds of savings for thinking about a mechanical bridge for next year? David Gitlin : Yeah. Let me start and then Patrick can give some more specificity. We have really tried to be as specific as we can on what's the pricing costs we're seeing by quarter and will give it in that color next year.  Carrier 700 when you see the input costs we're seeing, it did change. When it costs 10 times as much to get a container out of China into the U.S, when we're buying chips on the spot market, there have been some clear inflationary pressures that have affected the overall Carrier 700. Having said that, if you were to step foot in this building, you would see an entire war room focus on commodity management with our suppliers. You would see productivity being rolled out across the world.  So, we will give specificity on cost carryover, inflationary pressures going into next year, and how we're going to offset that at a minimum with price -- again, like Patrick said, being price-cost positive is our clear intent. But the Carrier 700 number itself is lower this year than what we thought. Patrick, do you want to add to that? Patrick Goris : Yes. I think, Steve, our -- we still intend to drive cost out next year compared to this year. That has not changed. And so, all those equal, we would expect our earnings conversion next year to be better than this year. Steve Tusa : That makes -- that makes a lot of sense. Just a follow-up on that. All these kinds of like -- you said, you're going to more sources like dual-sourcing, etc. I guess in a stable environment that can lead to better margin because your kind of playing them against each other.  My guess is, when you are dual-sourcing in this environment, it's actually, that's kind of like structurally higher costs you are trading off higher costs for availability. Is that being that the right way to look at it? David Gitlin : Go ahead. Patrick Goris : Actually. Because there are shortages of some of the components, we do have to go to sources that otherwise, we would not have gone. And so that's one of the reasons why today we are incurring some higher costs just because our normal sources have some constraints as well.  Some of the increases we see this year are associated with that but clearly, in a more stable environment, having more dual-sourcing should help from a cost point of view. Steve Tusa : Right. David Gitlin : Yes. I would add Steve that, look, there is an investment when we say we've gone from, say, a million automation hours to 3 million this year on our way to 6 million, that's an investment. But what happens is that really starts to pay back when you look at the investment is set up dual sources, there's an investment.  But when we get hopefully, towards the second half of next year as you get out there, then you have more supply demand imbalance and then we will feel much better about our ability to get back on the year over year cost reduction numbers that we're used to seeing. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then sorry, a quick 1, Sam going to kill me. I did not myself believe anything on the table though. The 150 in investments, how much of that is like rebates to distribution or stuff like that, that you're investing in installed base if you will, in commercial or resi or something like that. How much of that is that kind of activity versus like R&D and pure sales dollars of hiring people and things? Patrick Goris : For this year it's nothing. Steve Tusa : Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it. Patrick Goris : Fine. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Vlad Bystricky from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Vlad Bystricky : Morning guys. David Gitlin : Good morning. Vlad Bystricky : Giving Josh a run for his money there with that pronunciation. Thanks for taking my question. We've covered a lot of ground here, obviously. Just going back to labor. Obviously, labor availability seems to be a growing issue and we've now seen some labor actions in the U.S. in terms of strike activity. So, can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of wage inflation and labor availability in general. And then more broadly, how you're thinking about labor relations overall and the risk of potential disruptions. David Gitlin : Yeah Vlad, we are -- to set the stage, we have 80% of our people outside the U.S. And I would say the real labor challenges we have are at a couple of our sites in the U.S. And we have very close relationships with our union partners. And what we've -- in some areas in the U.S, we've had rage wages a bit and we've also put in place some bonus structures for output.  But we stay very, very close with our, our union partners here and we feel confident that we continue to create the right environment where people want to work here, then we'll manage that. Vlad Bystricky : Okay. That's helpful. And I think it makes a lot of sense around the incentives for production showed -- seems like it's helping with the results. Just following up, I think back to last year, I think you've added 600 or so sales people.  Now that we're approaching the end of '21 and they've been onboard for a while, can you talk about what you've seen from those incremental resources in terms of them ramping sales productivity and just more broadly, how you're thinking about the sales force positioning today whether you see opportunity to continue to add incremental talent and resources there? David Gitlin : We're very pleased with the results of the additional sales folks that we've added. We've been very targeted where we've added them. We've been very focused in certain areas in North America and in China where we've added salespeople. We've seen very good additional sales. Look, we came in the year thinking that we were going to grow 5%.  And after all is said and done, we're going to end up growing organically by 13%. And our investments in sales people and things like digital R and D, that's all contributing. So that's -- we felt we were underrepresented on the sales side. We've added the -- I think the right number, and we did say that our total investment starts to modulate a bit as we go into next year, we're going to end up with 50 additional investments. Clearly, salespeople take some years -- takes some time to pay back, but we look at it -- internally, we measure it on selling as a percentage of our gross margin, but pleased with the investment and the payback. Vlad Bystricky : Great, that's helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. David Gitlin : I t hink we're out of time. Operator : And that was our last question. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Dave for closing remark. David Gitlin : Thank you very much. Thanks to everyone. We appreciate you joining and we look forward to hosting you all here in our West Palm headquarters in Florida on February 22nd for our Analyst and Investor Day. Of course, as always, Sam is around for follow-up questions but thanks to all of you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. Except as otherwise noted, the Company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding restructuring and other significant items of a non-recurring and/or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items. The Company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other Forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. We'll leave time for questions at the end. Once the call is opened up for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to give everyone the opportunity to participate. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into our 4Q results, let me start on slide two. On Sunday, we announced that we reached a definitive agreement to acquire Toshiba's controlling stake and Toshiba Carrier Corporation our long standing HVAC joint venture. This is an important and compelling deal for us that we believe will create significant value for our customers, employees and shareowners by enhancing our position in the fast growing variable refrigerant flow and international light commercial markets.  We established our minority JV with Toshiba in 1999. Carriers had distribution responsibility with Toshiba having design and production responsibility. Together we have successfully grown TCC to be a world leader, with over $2 billion in sales. This acquisition will enable us to accelerate growth and profitability in this business by consolidating design, production and distribution under one roof, realizing synergies and leveraging our global scale to deliver even more differentiated products and solutions to customers globally. Before we talk more about the strategy behind this deal, let me have Patrick quickly discuss the financials, Patrick. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave. And good morning. Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire substantially all of Toshiba's interest in TCC for about $900 million. As you can see on the slide, Toshiba owns about 60% of TCC. Taking into account direct and indirect ownership structures of TCC subsidiaries, Toshiba's economic interest in TCC has fluctuated between 30% and 50% over time. Toshiba is retaining a 5% interest in TCC, or less than a 5% economic interest.  TCC generated 2021 calendar year sales of about $2.1 billion and approximately $250 million of EBITDA. We have been recording equity income associated with the TCC joint venture and have collected dividend payments as well. After the transaction closes, we will of course no longer record equity income. But once that fully consolidate TCCs financial statements.  Adjusting for intercompany sales and for the equity income that we recognize today, we expect to add about $2 billion to consolidated sales EBITDA of about $160 million and operating profit of approximately $90 million before purchase price adjustments such as intangible amortization, the $90 million operating profit is a reasonable proxy for the economic EBITDA we are acquiring.  Expected cost synergies of about $100 million will help us increase TCCs EBITDA margins. This acquisition is aligned with themes you have consistently heard from us; profitable growth, simplification, focus, and improved free cash flow. Let me turn it back to Dave to slide three and the strategic rationale behind the transaction. David Gitlin : Thanks, Patrick. First and foremost, we have been consistent in communicating our determination to become a more significant player in the fast growing VRF market. In 2015, the global VRF market was about half the size of the applied market. Since then, VRF has grown at more than 2x the rate of the applied market, and we project VRF to continue to outpace supply growth going forward. VRFs growth is no surprise, it is highly efficient electric sustainable modular, has lower installation costs and enables individual zone controls and segregated billing. With the acquisition of TCC last year's Giwee acquisition and our own VRF organic growth, our consolidated VRF sales would have increased 4x on an annualized basis, since our spin less than two years ago.  Second, as you would expect from Toshiba, TCC has highly differentiated technology made possible by its impressive 750 engineers. Its proprietary inverter technology and its award winning 3-stage rotary compressor technology provide world-class efficiency levels. Third, the Toshiba brand is deeply admired globally, and we have signed a long-term product license to the Toshiba name which will align well with our multi brand multi-channel strategy.  And finally, TCC has an excellent complementary global manufacturing footprint with new facilities in China and Poland and impressive factories in India, Thailand and Japan. We are very excited about this deal and expected to close by the end of Q3.  Now turning to Q4 results on slide four. Q4 was another strong quarter, wrapping up our first full year as an independent public company. Organic sales in the quarter were up 11% driven by continued strength in residential and light commercial HVAC, and transport refrigeration. Operating profits and free cash flow came in as expected. Order strength continued and led to record backlogs positioning us well for 2022. We also saw continued aftermarket growth which has been a major focus area for us, and the team continues to establish a more resilient supply chain for the future.  Progress in 2021 was very important as we target increase dual sourcing of critical components, increased automation and new direct relationships with chip manufacturers on security for supply. We have been balancing rising input costs with price increases to reach our goal of being at least price cost neutral in 2022. And our operations team has gone to tremendous lengths to support our customers. I thank all of them for their outstanding efforts.  I am proud that the team finished the year well, capping a full year of strong financial performance during which we exceeded all of our expectations. As you can see on slide five.  We came into 2021 projecting organic sales to be up about 5% and we ended up with organic sales of 15% adjusted operating margins grew 80 bps over 2020, despite the supply chain and inflationary challenges, and we invested an incremental $150 million to support continued growth.  Adjusted EPS increased 36% year-over-year well above our initial expectations. Finally, free cash flow of $1.9 billion converted at 114% of net income. In addition to our strong financial results, we successfully executed on our strategic focus areas as you can see on slide six. ESG and sustainability remain paramount for us. And we made great progress last year towards reducing net Scope 1 and 2 emissions on our way to carbon neutrality in our operations by 2030.  We also progressed on our Scope 3 goal of reducing our customer\u2019s carbon emissions by more than one giga ton by 2030, by introducing a greater number of electric and heat pump technologies, lower GWP refrigerant offerings, and more energy efficient solutions for our customers. Unhealthy buildings we booked about 500 million in orders last year and the pipeline has grown to about 700 million more than tripled what it was at the end of 2020.  We continue to see strong traction and momentum in verticals like K-12, where orders were up high teens in 2021, and the year-end pipeline is up double digit sequentially from Q3. Further validating the high demand for indoor air quality solutions that help rebuild confidence as society reenter schools, office buildings, stores, hotels and restaurants.  Providing customers with data on air quality is one way to build that confidence. And our digital and intelligent capabilities are critical differentiators. We made strong progress on our two platforms of focus Abound and Lynx. On Abound, we saw adoption by customers in the sports education and healthcare sectors. And on Lynx, we continue to expand our offerings with Lynx fleet and subscription activations in EMEA truck/trailer and container globally, adding more than 15,000 units in Q4 alone.  We are very focused on delivering lifecycle solutions and exceeded our stretch aftermarket targets. We saw a double digit aftermarket sales growth ending the year with more than 60,000 chillers under long-term agreements and we plan to add another 10,000 this year. We continue to take a very structured and balanced approach to capital deployment. With the net proceeds from the Chubb divestiture on January 3, we have reduced our net debt from over $9 billion it's been to about $4 billion. We completed four exciting acquisitions and we continue to build out our pipeline. We increased our annual dividend by 25% in December and we continue to repurchase our shares. We also drove growth cost savings through our Carrier 700 initiatives to help reduce the impact of inflationary headwinds. The entire organization remains focused on driving out discretionary costs, as controlling the controllables is even more paramount in this inflationary environment.  Slide seven describes our overall view on 2022. Given our strong backlog, and overall constructive economic environment and our strategic positioning, we see another strong year of financial performance with organic sales up high single digits on top of the 15% that we generated in 2021. We expect continued margin expansion despite dilution from price costs and acquisitions. We anticipate approximately 1 billion of inflationary headwinds in 2022 and are therefore targeting at least 1 billion or 5% of price realization this year, over 80% of which is carryover from actions taken last year and price increases that became effective in January of this year. Excluding Chubb from last year's results we expect another year of double digit adjusted EPS growth and strong free cash flow. Our focus areas heading into '22 remain the same. We will continue to drive innovation and differentiation in our pursuit to be the world leader and healthy safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain Solutions. We will continue to take concrete actions to increase our already top quartile ESG performance and use sustainability solutions to drive recurring revenues and growth.  We are targeting another year of double digit aftermarket growth while not losing our progress on tenacious cost reduction. Our commitment to discipline capital allocation remains unchanged with our strong balance sheet enabling us to play more offense going forward.  Before I turn it over to Patrick, I wanted to provide an update on our upcoming Investor Day. On February 22, members of our leadership team will provide a deeper dive into our attractive growing markets and how we plan to continue to outperform in those markets.  With that, Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave. Please turn to slide eight. Q4 benefited from solid organic growth throughout the segments. Residential and light commercial HVAC and transport refrigeration were important growth drivers in Q4, with organic sales growth well into the double digits. We realize more price than expected in the quarter, but that was more than offset by continued and increased inflationary challenges.  Similar to Q3, supply chain constraints impacted our factory efficiency levels and our ability to ship product. But it has left backlogs well positioned to deliver growth in 2022. Adjusted operating profit grew 14% year over year, and margins were up 20 bps over last year. Increased year over year investments offset the absence of one-time cost items we incurred in Q4 of 2020. Price costs finished about $30 million negative for the quarter versus our October estimate of about neutral. Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.44 benefited from six cents of discrete tax items. As expected, free cash flow was $775 million in Q4 and $1.9 billion for 2021. We\u2019ve repurchased 4.7 million shares in the fourth quarter, and about 10.4 million shares for the year in line with what we shared with you in October.  Let's turn to slide nine and cover our segments performance. HVAC organic sales were up 14% driven by continued very strong growth in residential, light commercial, and our ALC controls business. Resi sales were up high teens and movements was up 6%. Residential and light commercial demand remains very encouraging as orders continued to grow, leading to very strong backlogs as we entered 2022. Distributor movements was up 15% in our light commercial business, leading to field inventories for that business being down low single digits compared to last year. Commercial HVAC was up mid-single digits in the quarter and was impacted by supply chain challenges, particularly in North America. Our aftermarket business grew mid-single digits for the quarter and was up double digits for the year.  We met our goal of achieving at least 60,000 chillers and our service contracts by the end of 2021. Price cost was slightly positive in this segment but a headwind to margin. Acquisitions increased sales by about $90 million for HVAC but did not contribute operating profit given intangible amortization and integration costs. Moving to refrigeration on Slide 10. Organic sales reps 17% as a result of widespread growth throughout the segment. Truck trailer was up almost 30% and container was up over 30%. Electrification capabilities are an important differentiator for us in the segment, as we lead the industry with electric trailer units currently operating in 10 countries and additional capabilities being launched. Commercial refrigeration was up low single digits driven by solid growth in Asia, offset by flattish EMEA sales. Sensitech and aftermarket were both up double digits. Margins were down 10 bps in the quarter compared to last year. Price realization is improving in this segment, but is not yet offsetting increased input costs. In addition, operating performance and commercial refrigeration remains a significant opportunity. Moving to fire and security on Slide 11 Organic sales were up 3% as products grew 6%, while Chubb was down 3%. Operating margins expanded by about 60 bps in the quarter. Same as for refrigeration, price realization is improving, but price cost was negative. Mix was a tailwind to margin for this segment, as whereas the absence of one-time items in the fourth quarter of 2020. Slide 12 provides more details on orders performance. Excluding Chubb, company organic orders were up about 20% for the quarter. As I mentioned, residential and light commercial orders remained very strong in the quarter even against difficult comps. Commercial HVAC orders remained strong as well, with backlogs for this business up over 30% compared to last year. Refrigeration saw a mid-single-digit decline in orders for the quarter, mostly because we worked with customers to support demand, but did not reopen the second half 2022 order book until January of this year. In other words, timing. And we've already noticed a sequential pickup in orders in January. Backlog remains up about 30% in both transport and commercial refrigeration compared to last year. Order intake for our Fire & Security products remained very healthy at over 10%. Growth was led by commercial fire, industrial fire and access solutions. As you can see on the right side, we saw continued strength in all regions except China. COVID-related measures implemented in China impacted order intake in late Q4. That seems to have improved since the start of the year. We've seen some delayed projects booked and commercial HVAC in China saw double-digit order growth in January. Moving on to Slide 13. We saw a $0.13 increase year-over-year in adjusted EPS. Within operational performance, the benefit from higher volume and the absence of 2020 onetime items was partially offset by investments. Price/cost was a $0.02 headwind compared to last year. The effective tax rate was a $0.07 year-over-year benefit and mostly relates to discrete tax items. Finally, we saw a slight pickup from lower interest that gave us an extra $0.01 compared to last year. For your reference, we included a full year 2021 adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix. Moving on to 2022 guidance on Slide 14. Note that our guidance excludes the impact of the pending TCC acquisition. We expect reported sales of about $20 billion in organic sales up high single digits on top of the 15% organic growth we generated in 2021. We expect price to contribute about 5 points of the organic growth and volume 2 to 3 points. Acquisitions are expected to add about $200 million in sales, with minimal operating profit given intangible amortization and integration costs. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up compared to 2021 on about $600 million of lower reported sales. Operating margin is expected to expand by about 75 bps, helped by the sale of Chubb and despite $1 billion in price realization, offset by $1 billion of increased inflation. We expect all businesses within HVAC to have about high single digits organic growth in 2022. We expect mid- to high single-digit growth in both Refrigeration and Fire & Security. You can see expected adjusted operating margins for each segment on the bottom right. For Fire & Security, this significant margin expansion reflects the higher-margin product business now that Chubb has been sold.  I will cover adjusted EPS on the next slide, but just want to point out that our free cash flow guidance includes about $200 million in tax payments for the gain on the sale of Chubb and also assumes about $100 million of cash restructuring payments. Also, on Slide 21, you will find additional information about 2022 guidance. Let's move to Slide 15, 2022, adjusted EPS bridge at our guidance midpoint. As we've mentioned before, the Chubb sale is a $0.24 headwind to adjusted EPS next year. Operational performance is expected to deliver $0.24 of adjusted EPS growth next year. That is about $250 million of adjusted operating profits. At a high level, think of about $120 million or so of volume leverage and about $300 million of productivity, partially offset by about $100 million each for investments and merit increases. As I mentioned earlier, price costs are expected to offset. Obviously, at about $300 million, productivity will be a major driver of earnings in 2022 and includes about $100 million of G&A reductions. Investments in 2022 will be focused on enhancing our digital capabilities, R&D, and technologies enabling continued G&A cost reductions. Currency and net interest expense are a small headwind and tailwinds, respectively, and the benefit of share repurchases offset a higher expected adjusted effective tax rate of about 22%. That gets us to our midpoint of about $2.25 for next year. We've talked a lot about Carrier 700 in our cost reduction mindset this year, so we wanted to provide more insight on that on Slide 16. The Carrier 700 program was created over 2 years ago, in a low inflation environment, which obviously does not apply today. Excluding the significant material inflation challenges we faced in 2021, we actually made great progress on our Carrier 700 initiative by driving approximately $300 million of gross productivity savings. Since we historically included material inflation in our Carrier 700 numbers, our net savings were about neutral for the year. Moving forward and starting in 2022, we will measure our gross productivity efforts, excluding the impact of inflation. We plan to manage price to offset inflation. As I mentioned, we expect to drive about $300 million of cost reductions in 2022. We will provide further detail on our long-term opportunity for continued productivity at our upcoming Investor Day, but the bottom line is that cost takeout remains a key focus area at Carrier and will continue to fund investments annual merit and drive margin expansion. Moving on to Slide 17. Our priorities for capital deployment remained the same. As you can see on the right side of the slide, we have already committed to $3.75 billion of capital deployment for 2022 and will remain disciplined in capital allocation to maximize long-term shareowner value. The last topic I wanted to quickly touch on is the outlook for Q1 of 2022. We expect to see organic sales growth in each of the 3 segments, leading to high single-digit organic growth for the company. We expect price/cost to be modestly negative in Q1 at a level similar to Q4, with an adjusted effective tax rate of about 15% based on known discrete tax items benefiting Q1, we expect adjusted EPS to be approximately $0.45. Free cash flow is expected to be a use of cash in Q1 of about $100 million. Q1 is typically light and includes tax payments related to the Chubb sale and timing of the incentive compensation payout. In closing, Q4 wrapped up another strong year for Carrier with double-digit organic growth and 36% adjusted EPS growth. Thank you to all of our colleagues and partners, managing and supporting strong demand in a very challenging supply chain environment. With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Dave, to Slide 18. David Gitlin : Thanks, Patrick. So we are very pleased with our 2021 performance, but it is time to look forward. And as we do so, we are very bullish on the strategic and financial opportunities that lie ahead. With that, we'll open this up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to start off perhaps with the margin sort of cadence through the year at the HVAC and refrigeration segments. Maybe both were down year-on-year in Q4, refrigeration only slightly. But maybe help us understand kind of how you see those margins in that Q1 guide? And how quickly you get back to growth to drive that sort of 40 bps of expansion? Patrick Goris : Yes, Julian, Patrick here. So maybe I'll start with providing a little bit of additional color on the Q4 HVAC margins. As you mentioned, they were down 100 bps year-over-year. Think of volume being a tailwind to segment margin of 100 bps. Think of acquisitions where we added almost $100 million of revenue. But given also intangibles, operating profit is still slightly negative. That's almost 100 basis points headwind to margin for HVAC. Price cost, while slightly positive, as I mentioned for this segment, is actually 0.5 or 50 bps of a headwind this segment as this JV income. JV income is down year-over-year. That's another 0.5 point of headwind. And then investments offset mostly offset the Q4 2020 items we had. And so that gets you basically the 100 bps of headwind year-over-year for HVAC. In terms of 2020 and the calendarization there -- 2022, I should say, I think -- and I'm going to really provide color about the overall company rather than by segment. For Q1, we think that the segment margins will be similar to what they were in '21, maybe a little bit lower, a few tens of a point. For Q2, we think it will be similar. And so we think that Q3, Q4 margins will be a little better in '22 than they were in 2021. And of course, that reflects what we're expecting from a price cost point of view. We expect Q1 to be still slightly negative from price cost. I mentioned in my comments. We expect Q2 at this point to be about neutral. And in Q3, Q4, we expect to be slightly positive. And that would help our margins across our segments. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Thank you for that detail. And then maybe one other point around refrigeration. You mentioned in the slide 10 commercial refrigeration below expectations. Maybe just help us understand kind of the sort of scale and margin rate of that business? And what you do, how you do expect that to perform? And then any quick commentary on transport refrigeration. How you expect bookings to play out? Obviously, one of your peers sort of frightened people, I think, with some of their comments. David Gitlin : Yes, Julian, first on our Commercial Refrigeration business. It is one of our lower-margin businesses. It's kind of been in that mid- to high single-digit range from a margin perspective, and we've been consistent that we need to improve that business. So we have a lot of focus on it. We're pushing the team for significant margin expansion this year, but I would tell you, it's one of the businesses that last year did not perform at the levels that we would have expected. Now we are being more aggressive than we had been in the past on the price side. We are pushing operational performance, we are pushing differentiation and digital performance, we're rolling out length. So Tim, White, David, Apple and the team are really focused on doing the right things to improve the business, but that's a key focus area for us. And we know that we need to do it, but we have confidence around our plans in '22 to really improve the margins of that business. For overall transport refrigeration, I mean the fundamentals remained strong. As Patrick said upfront, we did toggle back on our order book purposely in the fourth quarter. We have plenty of backlog. We are working with our customers to make sure that -- we were taking the orders at the right time to support their needs when they need them. So we reopened the order book here in January. January orders were consistent with what we expected them to be.  We feel good about our backlog position in both North American truck trailer and European truck trailers. So the overall market seems like in a good place to us right now. Our overall focus for transport refrigeration and just generally supporting our customers. We still remain challenged on chip side and so input challenges. So we're spending a little bit more than we have in the past. Operationally, it's driving some inefficiencies in the factories, but we are -- our focus right now is supporting our customers. But the business feels positive to us, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning everyone. So lots of details, especially in your answer to Julian's question. Just curious, just to confirm the $1 billion, that's just the raw material bucket, so that excludes other sources of inflation? And then maybe just, Patrick, if you maybe break out the price, the $1 billion. I think last quarter, you talked about $350 million, $400 million of awards. So would that mean $400 million from the Jan 1 price increases and then 200 to be sourced from somewhere else? Patrick Goris : Yes. So the first question, I think, on the $1 billion think of $600 million so related to commodities, Tier 1 and Tier 2. And think of the remaining $400 million being other components as well as freight. And so that's the $1 billion. In terms of price realization, the $1 billion. On the call, we said last quarter, we said that the carryover we expected for '22 to be $350 to $400 million, as you mentioned. We actually did better than we expected in Q4 on pricing. We actually delivered about $50 million, $60 million better than what we expected on price, and it also means that the carryover is better.  And that's why we say of the overall $1 billion that we now target for this year, all but $200 million of that is either carryover or the prices that we have announced and have become effective in January of this year. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks, Patrick. And then just thinking about the -- obviously, steel is a really important input, and we're seeing some really encouraging signs on the futures and spot price for HRC is down. What are you dialed in for steel specifically into your guide? Are you assuming any benefits at all? Or are you just rolling forward at current prices? Patrick Goris : Yes. Nigel, we were not going to get into the details of what we're assuming for steel, aluminum and copper. I would just say that for aluminum and copper, we're about 70% locked for the year in terms of hedges. And also, we've also have some protection on the steel side as well with some agreements with some of our vendors, but we were not going to get into the specific rates we got locked into. Nigel Coe : Fair enough. Thanks Patrick. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. I don't think you called it out in your prepared remarks, but -- and you had 11% organic revenue growth. But did you have any supply chain issues where you couldn't make any shipments, maybe customers weren't ready, you didn't have parts? But can you size for us what shipments might have been missed? David Gitlin : Yes, Dean, what I'd tell you is that we certainly did have some supply chain issues. What I will tell you is that the bookings have been extremely positive. We do have some overdue sales to our customers. It's probably in the $200 million to $300 million range that we could have gotten had we not had the supply chain issues. But I would tell you that despite that, we go in -- we went into this year with record backlogs. And I will tell you that I'm very, very proud of the operations team in going to great lengths to support our customers despite the challenges. Deane Dray : Great. And then just congrats on the Toshiba acquisition. And we know VRF is a priority. Does this complete the platform for you? Do you need more manufacturing at least like in North America? But just where does that stand in terms of build-out? David Gitlin : Well, it's kind of one step at a time. What I'll tell you is that our sales in VRF, after we close on the Toshiba acquisition, we'll be up 4x from the time that we spun. So organic growth on our own VRF business that we had has been very positive. Then we added Giwee. Now we're going to close on Toshiba in the coming months. We're going to be integrating 6,000 phenomenal Toshiba employees into the system. We're going to have a multi-brand multi-channel strategy. We have to kind of let the dust settle on that, and then we'll assess where we go from there. But our goal in all of our businesses were leadership, and we'll drive that in all segments. Deane Dray : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Thanks. Good morning everyone. First, just a clarification. Patrick, your comment about the Q1 margins being similar to Q1 '21 had Chubb been last year. I just want to make sure we're comparing to kind of the margin with Chubb you're making some adjustment relative to the portfolio change? Patrick Goris : Compared to our reported margins from last year, so including Chubb, the external reported ones. And as I said, similar, maybe a few 10 bps lower. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then Dave and/or Patrick, maybe just coming back to Toshiba. I know it's early and you don't own it yet but can you give us a little more color on what you might be able to do relative to your own investment spending? I guess I'm kind of thinking of the fleet average of margins now in your VRF undertaking and what synergy or what R&D you might be able to now avoid that you have on the docket internally and just kind of the overall margin trajectory that you would expect out of the VRF effort. David Gitlin : Yes. If you look at what we've said, Jeff, is that the business that we're going to be inheriting is a little over $2 billion of sales, call it, $2.1 billion of sales with $250 million of EBITDA. So you have the margins on the base business there. And we said that we would have $100 million of synergies. So we'll grow margins through synergies. And we'll also grow margins as we would expect with all of our -- all of our businesses through top line growth and of course, the aggressive cost reduction actions that we take in all parts of our business. So we do see VRF margins growing. We do know that we have one of our peers in the VRF space with margins in the mid-20s. We won't be at that level in the next year or 2, but we also see that we have significant room for margin expansion. And the other thing is that there's some really nice -- one of the big things with the Toshiba acquisition is our focus on sustainability. They come to the table with phenomenal heat pump capabilities. We can use that technology, in other parts of our business, for example, we started to transition boilers and burners into more of a heat pump based business. We can use that the Giwee and the Toshiba technology to bring up the margins of that business. So we see this as margin expansion for the base TCC business and helping the broader Carrier margin story. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Just a question on product transition in 2022 and how this will sort of impact the cadence, right? And I'm thinking what should we be thinking about second half of '22 as we sort of try to manage the channel, try to manage production, trying to reduce new product ahead of new sort of SEER regulations? How will we see it on the revenue side this year? Will there be anything unusual in terms of annual cadence? Thank you. David Gitlin : Yes, Andrew, if I understand the question, it's really about North American resi. And as we transition to the new SEER requirements for '23, do you expect an element of pre-buy? I think it will be at the margin. We're expecting our resi business to be up high single digits this year. I mean, the bulk of that is coming. We're getting very good price realization in that business. So the bulk of it is from price. You may get a point or two from volume.  There could be a bit of pre-buy in the north because that's state of manufacturer. We're not really banking a much prebuy there. So what I will tell you is that what we focused on for 2023 was differentiation, things like copper to aluminum and other key technical attributes that we think would distinguish us in anticipation of 2023. So the products ready, the manufacturing sites are ready, and we just got to kind of get ready for that ramp as we get into the latter part of this year. Andrew Obin : Great. And just a follow-up question on Toshiba. So how should we think going forward the integration of Toshiba and Giwee because similar technology, different price points, will you maintain two separate brands? Or will there be some form of integration? Because I'm thinking VRF heat pumps, how will that play out? And also from a manufacturing standpoint? Thank you. David Gitlin : Yes. We will actually have a 3-brand strategy. We'll have Toshiba Carrier in Giwee in our VRF space. What we're going to do -- and Chris will get into this more on our February 22 Investor Day, but he's going to create a third segment under himself. So we'll have the traditional commercial applied business. We'll have residential light commercial, and then we're going to have a third business that has that VRF international light commercial heat pump business in it for globally. And that will include the Toshiba business, the Giwee business and some other aspects of our heat pump business. And then we can work a multi-brand, multichannel strategy for that business globally. Andrew Obin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Thomas Moll : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start on Toshiba and just following up on the multi-brand strategy here. So you'll now have three under the same umbrella. Just in terms of channel or the product portfolios, as they sit next to one another, what are the operational advantages you want to realize here with the three brands, like I said, under one umbrella? David Gitlin : Well, what's great about one of the many things, Tommy, that's great about this acquisition is we try to work customer back. We have, as part of the TCC joint venture, we've been responsible for almost all the distribution globally. So we get that customer input, but the design and production has largely been under Toshiba's responsibility. So there's been a bit of a breakpoint there. Now having it all under one roof, we get the customer input. What exactly features are they looking for? What brand and what technologies would be most suited for that application? And then we can feed that back into the design and the production of the product. So depending on where we are in the world, I can tell you that Toshiba is very well recognized and respected globally, certainly in China and elsewhere. So that brand plays great. We've been growing the Carrier brand under VRF, of course, Giwee now in the mix. So we can work this multi-brand strategy. And operationally, Toshiba comes to the table with a great footprint. They have brand-new factories in China, a brand-new factory in Poland, which plays well for putting more load from Carrier into those factories as well. They have facilities in Thailand, Japan and India. So a great footprint. So there's a lot of complementary footprint actions that we take on both sides. And of course, the supply chain piece. We have -- this is what we do for a living, HVAC. This is one of -- obviously, more than half of our sales are in the space. So integrating them into our overall supply chain can drive a lot of cost synergies and operational improvements as well. Thomas Moll : Appreciate it. Dave Shifting gears to the '22 outlook. I wonder if you could provide any detail on the $300 million of gross productivity. Just any timing context you can provide or any of the buckets underneath that supply chain factory and G&A that you could provide would be helpful. Thank you. Patrick Goris : Yes, Tommy, Patrick here. So I'd say that -- and I mentioned this in my comments that clearly, the G&A element of our productivity for next year is going to be much larger than it was in '21 at $100 million. And a lot of these actions have already been implemented. And so I'd say that, that is something where we do not have a big hockey stick in the year. There will be continued savings on the factory side as well as on the direct side, the direct material side, including a healthy amount of carryover. And so I'd say that Q1 will be closer to 15 -- actually, Q1 will be close to about 20% of the full year number of productivity we're looking at. And so I'd say not a huge hockey stick throughout the year, but we are assuming an improvement in factory efficiencies starting in Q2 versus where we were in Q4 and early Q1. And so that's certainly something that we are working hard on to realize because we are assuming a sequential improvement in factory efficiencies. Thomas Moll : Thank you Patrick. I\u2019ll turn it back. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. So a lot of good detail, but maybe a couple of questions here on residential. So I know orders in kind of a seasonally lower quarter might not be as telling, but think you're comping like a 20% number from last year with the 50 this quarter sort of getting kind of into serious numbers here. And you said the movement was a little lower than sell-in. Like how do you anticipate distributors sort of react as the channel stabilizes? Like, is there a risk that they overshoot? Or as your lead times start to come down, is that something that gives them confidence to sort of trust the system rather than pile it on in their warehouses? David Gitlin : Well, let me just give you a few data points, Josh, that the number -- obviously, we focus a lot on movement and inventories. Movement in the fourth quarter was up 6%. It's continued to be fine into January. So one key thing is that movement from our distributors to our dealers has continued to be positive. Inventories, we don't see getting away from us. So we mentioned that splits in the fourth quarter were up, say, mid-single digits. But largely, in balance to what we would have expected. We come into the year with our backlog up almost 3x year-over-year. So very strong backlog. Inventories generally balanced. Movement seems okay. We watch the order rates, but frankly, orders will be down probably in the first quarter year-over-year just given compares and given the overall backlog situation. So that doesn't alarm us. What we watch more is inventory levels and movement, which both seem to be generally where we would expect them to be. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just on Toshiba, obviously picking up a growth of your product category there. But maybe help us with kind of the breakdown of aftermarket versus new construction? Like are you picking up a lot more be in new construction exposure? And then what is the structural kind of all-in difference in free cash conversion at the organizational level as part of the transaction? David Gitlin : Well, Patrick can take the cash piece. I mean what I will mention on that is they're just coming off having built entirely new factories in China and Poland. So CapEx over the last couple of years was inflated versus the levels that you would expect. So CapEx will come down, and I think cash will get more in balance as -- on a going-forward basis. The -- it's a nice balance between OE and aftermarket, we'll get into some of that more of that color in February. But the great news, I would say, is that the technology and the brand, Josh, are really something special. If you look at the inverter technology, which has enabled this 3-stage rotary compressor, which really is differentiated in the marketplace. You combine that with our global distribution channel, there is a potential to make a really, really positive and big impact on the global VRF market. So we could not be more excited about how we can grow the business, how we can improve the margins, how we can really create a competitive advantage with our multi-brand, multichannel strategy. So this is a deal that we've wanted to do for a number of years. We had the timing worked out, right, and we could not be more excited about it. Patrick, anything you want to add? Patrick Goris : On the free cash flow the TCC, as Dave mentioned, they've had some several years of big investments in new facilities. Our estimate is that for 2021, the free cash flow conversion there was closer to about 80%. Once you normalize CapEx, we see no reason why it would be similar to us, which is about 100% conversion of free cash flow. And of course, once we go through the integration, there might be some onetime costs associated with that, but that is all the work that will be done over the next several months. Josh Pokrzywinski : Awesome, great details. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Hey guys can we maybe just start on the investments? I think we originally had you guys doing roughly around $150 million incremental last year. I'm just curious where that shook out, what you expect for 2022 And then maybe just some more kind of qualitative color just around how far you are along in your sales force expansion initiative? Patrick Goris : Yes, Joe. So actually, for 2021, full year investments were $15 0 million, 1-5-0 incremental to 2020, which is exactly what we shared with you when we initiated guidance one-year ago for 2021. And that was heavily weighted towards selling about half of it, and then digital and R&D capabilities. But 2022, we -- as I mentioned in my comments, we are targeting $100 million of investments and a similar -- I'd say, a similar split in terms of digital capabilities, R&D and selling. Although I'd say that it's probably a little bit more weighted in '22 towards digital in R&D versus selling. And I think, Dave, do you want to add some color on some? David Gitlin : Yes. What I would tell you, Joe, is that I think that a chunk of the selling is just carryover for hires that we made last year. So I don't see '22 being a year of significant adds to our sales force. I think that we felt like we had to get to a certain level, make sure that we integrate our sales force appropriately, appropriately train them, incentivize them, make sure that we are getting the drop-through that we expect. So I think that we're in a bit of a settling out period on that. I don't see significant headcount adds to our sales force because we like where we are going into '22. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's super helpful. And then clearly, since you guys became a stand-alone entity, there was a lot of focus around deleveraging and what you could potentially do from a portfolio standpoint. You guys have been extremely active. I'm just curious, as you kind of think about the portfolio today, just any thoughts on maybe additional actions on pieces of the portfolio that maybe are, I don't know, below segment average? I'm just curious how are you guys thinking about portfolio optionality today given all the changes that have occurred in the last couple of years? David Gitlin : Well, the nice thing, Joe, is that we put ourselves in position for that optionality. We started -- when we spun from UTC less than two years ago, $9 billion, $10 billion of net debt, and now we have a little less than $4 billion. So we are in a position to do a lot of things on the capital allocation side. We obviously, have Toshiba. We talked about increasing the dividend by 25% for this year. We talked about the share buyback of around $1.6 billion. And we have plenty of firepower for additional acquisitions. So we've done a lot of work in building out the pipeline.  Of course, our focus right now is integrating closing on and then integrating Toshiba. But we continue to look for other acquisitions. And we want to make sure that they're in the fairway and focused on our key areas of strategic priorities : healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions. And there are -- again, we're building out the pipeline. We continue to look at our current portfolio, and make sure that everything in our current portfolio fits with us and we're the better owner and we'll continue to look on the outside and always prune and we have a lot of self-help capabilities and we'll continue to stay active. Joe Ritchie : Make sense. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hey guys, good morning. So just on the pricing, what was the absolute price capture for the company on a dollar basis in 4Q? Patrick Goris : A little over $200 million, Steve. Steve Tusa : Okay. And so you're saying that the $1 billion for '22 includes $800 million of carryover and then stuff that you're initiating on Jan 1? So I guess does that mean the extra $200 million is stuff that you kind of are thinking about for later in the year? I mean how much visibility do you have on that 200 -- extra $200 million? Am I looking at that the right way? Patrick Goris : Steve, you are looking at it the right way. And in terms of visibility, I think this is something over the next couple of months, not six months from now. And so it is more concrete than we're thinking about it. Steve Tusa : Okay. Got it. And then just one last one, just on the HVAC incrementals in the fourth quarter. I appreciate there's a lot moving around. Can you just remind us of what the -- I think we had like $100 million of like what you guys called some unusual headwinds in 4Q '20? Or is that kind of still the right number to put in the bridge for this year? Or just wanted to kind of clarify that. Patrick Goris : Yes, I'll do so. Last year, Q4 was closer to 50 for the overall company. And HVAC being the largest segment got the majority of that. And that was mostly not completely offset by incremental investments in the segment in Q4 of '21.  And then other items I mentioned was -- you have about a 0.5-point headwind in HVAC because of price cost, even though price/cost was slightly favorable. And then JV income and acquisitions were a slight headwind as well for HVAC in Q4 '21. Steve Tusa : Wasn't there some contract renegotiation charge or something like that in 4Q '20 as well? Patrick Goris : There was something contract-related was part of that. David Gitlin : That was part of the 50. Patrick Goris : Part of that 50. Steve Tusa : Got it. Okay great. Thanks guys, appreciated. Operator : Our next question comes from Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Vlad Bystricky : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my call. So lots of ground has been covered already, obviously. Maybe can you just comment a bit -- obviously, good order momentum there? Can you comment on what you're seeing in market share across the portfolio, particularly in HVAC? And how you're balancing your margin expansion objectives versus driving faster growth and taking market share? David Gitlin : Well, obviously, we want to make sure that we get margin expansion, but we've seen very good price realization. And I think a lot of the share gains that we've seen are in part because of the investments we've made in things like digital differentiation, technology differentiation and the additional sales force we've had. But we've also worked very closely with our distribution partners to kind of improve those relationships and how we support our customers. And frankly, our operational performance; is I think, really helping us in our ability to support the demand that's out there. We gained about 130 bps in share and splits last year. We gained about 350 basis points in light commercial, and that is not at the on the pricing side through anything we're doing there. In fact, I would tell you, we've been, I think, appropriately aggressive on the pricing side given some of the dynamics we're seeing on the input side. So we have to do both. We have to grow the business. We're focused on differentiating the business, and we have to have margin expansion. I think we've done a nice job of balancing those. Vlad Bystricky : Okay. That's really great color and helpful. And then maybe just continuing on the growth front. You've talked in the past about opportunity in resi HVAC to drive stronger parts sales in that business. Can you talk about what kind of traction you're seeing with that initiative? And how much of a tailwind that can be over the next couple of years? David Gitlin : It's been -- it's the same with the rest of our business is that we want to provide life cycle solutions for our customers. And to drive additional parts on the resi side, it has to do with how we work with our suppliers, how we work with our distribution partners, our dealers, our end customers. So we've tried to take a series of actions in a new playbook to make sure that we can get customers the parts they need when they need them, at the price points they need them. So it's been, frankly, a focus area, and it's been some nice tailwind for us. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back for closing remarks. David Gitlin : Okay. Well, thank you all for joining. We're looking forward to seeing you here down at Palm Beach Gardens on February 22. Thank you, all. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Carrier's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available to download on Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. Except as otherwise noted, the company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-recurring and/or non-operational nature often referred to by management as other significant items.  The company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. We will leave time for questions at the end. Once the call is opened up for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to give everyone the opportunity to participate. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our Q1 results on Slide 2. Q1 was another strong quarter for us, and I am proud of how our team continues to execute in the face of global challenges. We delivered 12% sales growth, excluding the impact of Chubb. Organic orders growth remained strong at 10% and our backlog is up almost 30% organically versus last year.  Adjusted operating profit was up 7% compared to last year and up high teens, excluding the impact of Chubb. Price/cost was neutral in the quarter better than expected. Free cash flow was a larger-than-expected outflow in the quarter, mainly due to supply chain shortages impacting inventory levels. We continue to expect to generate $1.65 billion of free cash flow this year.  We remain focused on the priorities that you see on Slide 3, above-market organic growth, margin expansion, strong free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation. This slide summarizes our value creation framework as presented at our recent Investor Day, which not only forms the basis for our updates to our investors but also drives our priorities via our internal goal alignment process. I recently spent a week in Europe and a week in Asia and saw first-hand how our people globally are driving results tied to these priorities.  From our world-class operations in our Singapore container factory to the tremendous innovation from our colleagues in Hyderabad and New Delhi, to the discipline and energy in our sites throughout Poland, it was encouraging to see the power of focus, culture and talented empowered teams coming together to provide solutions for our customers. I'll address our progress on the key elements of this value creation framework starting with growth on Slide 4. We continue to lean into the opportunities provided by the secular trends presented at our Investor Day that we are confident will drive above-market growth despite macro uncertainty and supply chain challenges. On healthy indoor environments, we saw $125 million worth of orders in Q1, and our healthy buildings pipeline is now $850 million, up more than 20% sequentially from the fourth quarter. We continue to play offense on ESG and sustainability.  The combination of the upcoming Toshiba acquisition and our newly announced European heat pump design center of excellence position us favorably to enter the attractive European residential heat pump market. This will complement our leadership in global commercial heat pumps. As an example, our low GWP heat pump chiller orders in Europe were up over 30% in the first quarter.  Electrification is equally critical in transport refrigeration, where we recently added Woolworths, Australia's largest supermarket chain. We now have more than 10 countries where our Vector eCool all-electric reefer [ph] units are in service. In terms of digitalization, our key focus remains on rapid adoption of our Abound and Lynx platforms. We've incorporated energy monitoring and alert reporting capabilities into our Abound platform and achieved key wins across verticals, including education, retail and industrial. There are now over 750 million square feet monitored by Abound. This includes an important recent win with Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.  Our digital capabilities are receiving more widespread recognition. For example, within the Abound platform, our CORTIX solution recently won several key awards, including the 2022 Artificial Intelligence Excellence Award organized by the Business Intelligence Group; and the AI Breakthrough Award's 2021 Best Predictive Analytics platform. CORTIX offers predictive insights and autonomous actions to optimize equipment performance and building operations, and is currently connected to over 300,000 pieces of building equipment from multiple OEMs. This is a good example of how our digital platforms deliver customer value across a diverse installed base.  We have also expanded our Lynx capabilities, including asset tracking, prognostics and temperature alarms, and we remain on track to have 100,000 Lynx subscriptions by the end of this year. We remain confident that the increasing middle class will continue to drive demand for our products in countries such as India, where income levels are increasing and penetration levels of our portfolio of solutions remain low. In addition to the tailwinds from these secular trends, we continued to accelerate growth in our core businesses through innovation and differentiation, which you can see on Slide 5. After releasing 21 new products in Q1, we remain on track for more than 125 new product introductions in 2022. Our innovation pipeline is centered around our core strategy of healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions.  One example is that we recently introduced a smoke and carbon monoxide detector with embedded indoor air quality sensors with all the data connectable to smart home ecosystems. Our R&D efforts on disruptive technologies are progressing well. One example is our traction on the Department of Energy's challenge to improve the efficacy of heat pumps at cold ambient temperatures. Our unit is currently under test at the Oak Ridge National Labs. We have demonstrated the expected performance with a better-than-required coefficient of performance at ambient temperatures of 5 degrees Fahrenheit using our forthcoming low GWP refrigerant. We are working to commercialize our solution to increase adoption of heat pumps over oil and gas fuel heating systems in colder regions.  I am pleased to announce that we have a new Chief Technology Officer. (inaudible) recently led Honeywell Aerospace's 10,000 engineers and previously held critical roles at BorgWarner and Bosch. His experience driving customer solutions across a broad range of cutting-edge technologies at the intersection of hardware and digital position him perfectly to help take our innovation efforts to the next level. Another critical growth driver for us is aftermarket and recurring revenues, which you see on Slide 6. After 11% growth in 2021, aftermarket sales were up high single digits in Q1. Across Carrier and within each segment, we have detailed KPIs across the vectors that you see here : parts capture; service coverage; digital solutions; and healthy and sustainable offerings. We remain committed to delivering on our full year KPIs, including having 70,000 chillers under long-term agreements and 20,000 connected chillers by year-end. So, our growth drivers remain encouraging.  Turning to margin expansion on Slide 7. At our Investor Day, we committed to over 50 basis points of margin expansion per year with 2022 projected to be closer to 75 basis points, and we exceeded that in the first quarter, growing adjusted operating margins by 110 basis points. We remain on track to deliver the $300 million of gross productivity savings that we committed to for 2022. Related to that productivity improvement, we are very purposeful about building a more resilient supply chain and we are tracking to our commitments around dual sourcing of critical components and increasing factory automation.  With that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8. As expected, reported sales were down due to the Chubb divestiture. Organic sales growth was better than our high single-digit Q1 guidance, with all segments growing organically. Residential and light commercial HVAC growth was stronger than expected, with resi up over 20% and light commercial up over 30% compared to last year. Both price and inflation were higher than we anticipated and price/cost was neutral.  Productivity and higher JV income also contributed to strong adjusted operating profit, which was up 7% compared to last year despite lower reported sales. Core earnings conversion, excluding the impact of price/cost, was well over 50%. Adjusted EPS of $0.54 was also better than the guidance we provided in February given stronger sales, margins and a lower share count. For your reference, we added an adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix on Slide 19. Free cash flow was a use of $258 million versus than the use of $100 million we guided to on our Q4 earnings call. The primary driver was an increase in inventory. We continue to operate with higher safety stock and missing components are delaying shipments. We still expect to generate $1.65 billion in free cash flow for the full year, but this will be more back-end loaded as we expect supply chain conditions to improve in the second half.  Let's turn to Slide 9 and cover our segments performance. HVAC organic sales were up 18% driven by continued very strong growth in residential, light commercial and our ALC/Controls businesses. Resi movement and field inventories for splits and furnaces were both up low single digits. Light commercial distributor movement was up double digits in the quarter with field inventories up modestly versus prior year. Within Commercial HVAC, Applied and Controls grew double digits. Adjusted operating margins were up 120 basis points compared to last year, mainly due to volume leverage and mix. Price/cost was slightly positive for this segment as better-than-expected price realization more than offset higher material and freight costs. We expect this segment to remain price/cost positive this year.  Moving to Refrigeration on Slide 10. Organic sales were up 1% in the quarter, a bit lower than expected due to supply chain challenges mostly affecting truck and trailer. As expected, container was down mid-teens compared to a record quarter last year.  Truck and trailer was up mid-single digits. Commercial refrigeration was up mid-single digits, driven by solid growth in EMEA, and Sensitech continues to do well and was up double digits. Adjusted operating margins were down 130 basis points compared to last year, mainly due to lower volume and price cost. Price realization is improving in this segment and is expected to be neutral in Q2.  Moving on to Fire & Security on Slide 11. Excluding Chubb sales from the first quarter of 2021, Fire & Security segment sales were up 8% with strong broad-based growth this year. Adjusted operating margins expanded 160 basis points in the quarter, mainly as a result of the Chubb divestiture. Price/cost was neutral in this segment, better than expected. Slide 12 provides more details on orders performance. Total company organic orders were up about 10%. As expected, Residential HVAC orders were down modestly in the quarter, with Light commercial orders about double last year's levels. Commercial HVAC orders also remained very strong, with backlogs for this business up over 30% compared to last year. Refrigeration orders were flat in the quarter. Transport orders were down modestly as we continue to actively manage our Q4 order book for the truck and trailer business. The backlog remains up about 30% in both transport and commercial refrigeration compared to last year.  Order intake for our Fire & Security products remain very healthy, up about 20%. Growth was widespread throughout the portfolio. As you can see on the right side, we saw continued strong orders growth in all areas of the world. Order strength continued in all regions in April, with the exception of China, which was down year-over-year.  Moving to an update on capital deployment on Slide 13. We had quite some activity in Q1. We collected $2.9 billion from the Chubb sale, repurchased about $740 million worth of shares and paid down $1.15 billion worth of debt. In addition, we announced the acquisition of our JV with Toshiba for about $900 million. We continue to expect this acquisition to close by the end of Q3. Integration planning for the acquisition is progressing.  Our actions continue to strengthen our credit metrics and provide plenty of flexibility for value-add capital deployment. We continue to target $1.6 billion of share repurchases for 2022 and expect to issue $400 million of yen-denominated debt prior to the TCC acquisition. Total debt reduction for 2022 remains $750 million, consistent with what we shared with you in February at our Investor Day. Now moving on to guidance on Slide 14. We had a good and better-than-expected start to 2022. But with just 1 quarter behind us, we are maintaining our guidance for organic sales growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. From a calendarization perspective, we expect the lockdowns in Shanghai to impact Q2's sales by about $100 million, mainly in commercial HVAC and truck and trailer as both businesses have a manufacturing footprint in that area. This assumes businesses open up in the next few weeks, and we currently do not expect this to impact our full year. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave to Slide 15. David Gitlin : Thanks, Patrick. We are pleased with a strong start to the year. Our backlog gives us confidence about continued strong growth, and the team continues to overcome unexpected macro challenges to deliver results for our customers and our investors.  With that, we'll open this up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : So I guess, just maybe first question on the commercial side, where you saw some momentum. Dave, do you feel like some of the stuff we've been talking about here, maybe more structurally on whether it's indoor air quality or some of the stimulus money going into education, is hitting the system? Or are we still kind of on the other side of just easy COVID comps and kind of getting back to work there? David Gitlin : No, I think it has a lot to do with the secular trends and some of the initiatives that we've launched. You look at K-12, our orders were up 50% in the first quarter, which is, as you know, Josh, significant. Our pipeline grew 25% sequentially. So, we're starting to see SR2 and SR3 funds being released in K-12, and that's encouraging. Aftermarket was up double digits in our HVAC business. Controls was up north of 20%, which has been a big focus area for us. And then when we look more broadly at the underlying business itself, we now have seen, I think, 14 straight months where ABI was north of 50%. So, orders continue to be very strong. The global applied business was up 15%. North America was up over 20%. So, when we look at ALC, Controls, aftermarket trends, healthy buildings where the pipeline is now at 850 and then K-12, a lot of these underlying trends that we've talked about are dropping through. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the resi business, we're kind of price-on-price-on-price at this point in terms of the marketplace. I think you mentioned in terms of the movement versus sell-in. Inventories are at healthier, if not a little higher than usual. How should we think about kind of the sensitivity point to that end consumer for what is a pretty significant dollar increase in the price? Are you seeing any kind of pushback or elasticity of demand there? David Gitlin : Not yet. What we are seeing is, I guess really, record levels of price realization. We said that resi for us in the first quarter was up over 20%, more than half of that from price. So we have announced about 5 price increases in the last couple of years. And by the way, we have to because of the input costs that we're seeing. So really, what we're doing is dealing with the inflationary pressures we have through trying to stay out in front of it through price increases. But clearly, for resi, we watch movement very carefully. That was generally in line with field inventories, both up kind of in that low single-digit range if you focus on splits and furnaces.  And orders were down modestly, but we expected that orders have been fine here in April. So there's a lot of pent-up demand for resi. Price realization has been strong. And then, of course, as we get into the back half of the year, we'll have to see how the switchover takes place as folks gear up for the 2023 introduction. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just to start off with the sort of price versus cost dynamic. So I think before you guided something like $1 billion of cost headwinds and $1 billion or so of price for the year. Just wondered sort of any updated thoughts on those 2 points and maybe what the impact from those 2 items was in the first quarter. Patrick Goris : Yes. Julian, Patrick here. So clearly, Q1 was better than we expected at neutral versus negative. I'd say that for the full year, you do recall, we said $1 billion price, $1 billion inflation. Based on the current quarter and what we're seeing, it is likely that will do a little bit better than the $1 billion. Frankly, with all the price increases we've announced, we have -- we're on the -- on track for that $1 billion. It could be a little bit better than $1 billion, but at the same time, we've seen some of the input costs come up as well. And so for the time being, we continue to target price cost neutral for the year, but we understand that pricing will be likely a little bit higher than $1 billion, and so will inflation. Julian Mitchell : Thanks, Patrick. And in the first quarter, the cost headwind was, what, a few hundred million or so? Patrick Goris : It was north of $300 million. Julian Mitchell : And then just my follow-up would just be around that Refrigeration business and kind of the slope for getting the margins kind of where you want them to be in that sort of 40 bps plus range. What are the main drivers for that? How quickly do we see that margin catch up? Patrick Goris : Well, Julian, our expectation is that Q1 will be the low point for margins in Refrigeration. A big driver of margins in Q1 was price/cost. Price/cost was about a 150 or so basis point headwind for that segment in Q1. We expect price/cost to be neutral starting in Q2, and that will help improve the margins versus where it is today, where it's a more significant headwind. And so the good thing is as we've seen price realization improve in Refrigeration. Since -- frankly, since the second quarter of last year, price realization has improved every quarter and price realization in Q1 was almost double of what it was in Q4. So, I believe -- we believe we're on the right track there. Operator : Next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a question on interest rates and distribution. One of the commentaries referred from the channel is that the reason the distribution is comfortable carrying as much inventory as it does right, is because the floor financing is pretty cheap. With interest rates going up, and I appreciate that you have one very, very large distributor -- but with interest rates going up, is this coming up with your discussions with distributors and this idea that structurally, regardless of how strong the cycle is, maybe they will carry less inventory just because, right, on an absolute basis, the interest payments will go up over time? David Gitlin : No. That has not been a major focus area for our discussions with our -- not only our distributors, but our dealer channel as well. The -- what we're seeing in resi right now is the same that we've been seeing for the last couple of years. So, I know there's sort of this general anxiety about residential. And the best that we can do is stay completely tied in with our channel partners to see what they're seeing. And what they're seeing is generally a strong consumer, the same trends that drove a 10% growth 2 years ago, drove 20% growth last year, drove north of 20% in the first quarter, generally continue. Housing starts were positive in the first quarter. They were up about 10%. This whole work-from-home phenomenon and that, which is more migrating to a hybrid work environment. That continues. We continue at Carrier to see share gains. We had probably about 100 bps of share gains in the last year or so, and that continued in the first quarter. And there's more demand for some of the higher-end units.  The challenge we have is that the higher end you get, the more chips you rely on, and that's where we've struggled on the supply chain side. So a lot of the underlying trends have continued. I think the biggest discussion we have is not as much around interest rate impact, but it's just more around the switchover and the cutover that's going to take place in the second half of the year as we gear up for the 2023 units. And especially in the South, because that is such an unprecedented move where it's date of installation. So the distributors and dealers in the South want to end up with 0 inventory of today's units but have sufficient inventory to support the first quarter. And we -- that's going to be the switchover that is unprecedented and that could be great news as we get into the second half, it could not be. We have to see how that cutover takes place. The good news is that Chris and Justin are completely tied in on a daily basis with our channel partners, and we're managing their needs as best we can. Availability will still hurt many of our customers because we've been a little bit late. But I can tell you, I think, with confidence, we've been doing better than others and availability has helped us gain some share as well. Andrew Obin : No, that's a great answer. I really appreciate it. Just a follow-up question. You mentioned a heat pump opportunity in Europe. Could you just size what the market TAM is? And what could this be for Carrier over time? David Gitlin : Well, I'll tell you, without giving you a specific number, Andrew, we are very, very bullish on the European heat pump market. I mean -- and I think that if you look at it, you look at it on the commercial side, -- we can say with confidence we're the market leader with commercial heat pumps in Europe. We have great technology. We have great channel partners. We're going to, of course, be -- we've added Giwee, we'll be adding Toshiba in the next few months. And what we saw in the first quarter alone was that commercial heat pump orders in the first quarter were up 30%. And it's helped by the fact that we introduced a great new product in the first quarter of last year, this low GWP air cooled chiller that we've talked about. So the key for us is to make a bigger play for resi heat pumps in Europe where we're not a real player today. So we're going to invest in that space. I think you should be confident of that because we know it's going to grow. They're probably going to add about 30 million heat pumps in Europe on the resi side by 2030. So we're not a player, but we'll be adding Toshiba, we have Giwee. We're adding a heat pump center of excellence using our Riello business in Italy and already has a channel. So we're going to be emphasizing resi heat pumps in Europe going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Good quarter, good start of the year. Sorry, I joined the call a little late, so I apologize if this has already been discussed. Are we still tracking to $1 billion of price realization for this year? And I know that $1 billion you had in the plan and captured the April 1 price increase. But do you have any more price increases in the plan for this year? Patrick Goris : Yes, Nigel, Patrick here. So what we said earlier was that with everything we've announced to date, we're comfortable that we'll realize $1 billion or more of price this year. And so it's likely, given our performance in Q1 that we'll do better than $1 billion this year. But we also believe that the inflation will be higher than the $1 billion we expected a quarter ago. And so we think that both price realization but also inflation will be higher than $1 billion. The good thing is with the prices we have announced, we think we're comfortable with the $1 billion -- or at least $1 billion of price realization this year. That's announced, not yet realized, of course. David Gitlin : What I would add, Nigel, is that when we talk price, I think a lot of our investors assume we fixate on resi. What we're seeing with prices it's across the portfolio. Jurgen and his team in Fire & Security, Tim and his team in Refrigeration, all pushing price in a very concerted way with I would say, more effectiveness than we've ever seen in our history. So clearly, Chris and the team in overall HVAC have done very, very well on the price side, which gives us great confidence in our numbers for the rest of the year. But it really is across the portfolio. Nigel Coe : David, that's great. And then you mentioned the price/cost was negative in Refrigeration. Was that just transport refrigeration -- just to clarify, was that for the whole segment or just the transport side? And then that obviously implies that HVAC was positive for the quarter, if you can just confirm that. But my broader question on this price/cost is, if you were neutral overall in 1Q, why wouldn't you be better than neutral for the full year? I think the plan is to be neutral. But why wouldn't it be better given that 1Q is arguably your toughest comp? David Gitlin : It's early. I mean, that's -- I guess the short answer is that we -- Nigel, we expected Q1 to be negative, as you said, and it was neutral. It does give us confidence that we've taken aggressive pricing actions that bode well for the rest of the year. But we also have to keep an eye on inflation where there remains a lot of uncertainty. I think anyone's ability to predict inflation going out a few quarters is suspect. So we'll keep an eye on it. Right now, we feel very good about where we stand on price cost going through the year, but we do have to keep an eye on it and give us a few more months to see how things continue to play out. Nigel Coe : That's fair. And sorry, what was residential price in the quarter? Patrick Goris : We said residential was up over 20% overall sales, more than half of that driven by price. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : You guys had mentioned a couple of other items for the bridge. I think it was like a $300 million productivity number or something like that. Any changes on anything else moving around on as far as the annual bridge concerned? And then what was that number in the first quarter? Patrick Goris : Steve, no change for the overall year. We still continue to target $100 million -- no, sorry, $300 million of productivity, $100 million of reinvestment. And productivity in the first quarter was over $50 million. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then anything more on the second quarter as far as seasonality? I mean you mentioned the $100 million or so in China shifting out? And anything else in 2Q? Or should we expect a somewhat normal seasonality? Patrick Goris : I'd say somewhat normal seasonality, Steve. I will say that last year, you may recall, the margins in HVAC were exceptionally high, I think they were almost 19%. We do not expect HVAC margins to be that high in Q2. We expect margins in HVAC to be up a little bit compared to Q1, but not to the extent that it was last year. And we expect our overall margins in Q2 to be maybe a few basis points below what it was last year. Steve Tusa : Yes. And sorry, what is normal seasonality? I think these days, I don't know what normal is. But how do you guys see normal seasonality like maybe first half, second half when it comes to EPS? What is that typically? Patrick Goris : Well, Q2 EPS is expected to be higher than in Q1, also because the volume -- the volumes tend to pick up in Q2 and Q3. Steve Tusa : Right. Yes, I was looking for a little more precision there, but I guess I'll just take what I can get there. One last one. David, how exactly do you expect this to play out, the '23 transition? Maybe give us a little more precise color on like what you're currently thinking is the outcome when it comes to sell-in and with the new products and the old products over the course of the second half and into '23. Like what's the current strategy that you're taking on that front? David Gitlin : No, the current strategy is that we will be introducing the 2023 product really focused on the South starting in the next few months. So as we start getting into August, the products that they'll be receiving in the South will be the 2023 products because that's what they have to gear up to start selling right on January 1. We'll introduce that the new product for the North as we get closer to the end of the year because they'll be stocking inventory of today's units because that's data manufacturing in the North in the third and fourth quarter. So introduced the '23 product earlier for the South later for the North, and then we'll have to see the cut-over.  We all watch inventory levels and movement levels, I would tell you, Steve, very, very carefully. And they remain generally in balance with what we expected. So we watch inventory levels not only with our distributor partners, but also what's being stocked in the dealer network as well. And we haven't we haven't seen anything alarming. We do expect year-end inventory levels be down year-over-year, depending, of course, what happens with movement in inventory over the next 6 months or so. But our expectation is year-end inventory levels would actually be down year-over-year. And we're going to stay super close with our partners on this transition. Steve Tusa : And then, you would consider the move -- when you start selling those in and they're like 10% higher or whatever they are, you would consider the related revenue increase as mix as opposed to price, correct, when you layer those into the channel? Patrick Goris : Well, movement, we've been seeing low single digits, not 10% on (inaudible). Steve Tusa : On price, on the difference in price per unit, per unit, right, at the minimum level. Doesn't that price of that minimum unit go up for the new product? Patrick Goris : Yes. Yes. The price -- yes, good point. The price of the new units we've said will be 10% to 15% higher than today's unit. So yes, that plays in. Steve Tusa : And but that will be a mix, not price, correct? Patrick Goris : Yes, that's the one way to look at it. Yes, that's right. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. JoeRitchie: So, just -- maybe just elaborate a little bit more on China. You guys mentioned in April, the orders turned negative. I'm assuming that's because of lock down and then you've embedded this $100 million headwind for 2Q. Just give us a little bit more color on like what are kind of like the range of outcomes there and like what you're actually hearing and seeing on the ground? David Gitlin : Well, we're watching this one carefully, Joe. I mean what I'll say upfront is that China is important to us. We believe in China, it's part of our growth vector. We're a leader in transport, commercial fire, commercial HVAC, as you know. It is 8% of our sales. We kind of came into the year with our biggest concern being around real estate. But the good news is that only 1/3 of our sales in China are real estate and less than 10% of that is where the biggest focus area, which has been these multifamily residential. So that specific vertical where a lot of attention has been is less than 0.5% of our sales. What's happened over the last I would say, a couple of months is these lockdowns have had a significant impact on a lot of folks. We -- it's been really acute for us in Shanghai, where we have 4 of our factories in Shanghai, a couple in commercial HVAC, 1 for Riello, 1 for transport. And we have 130 suppliers in the region.  We've applied for reopening under their exception rules. We're in the process. We track it daily. We're hoping that we get granted not only for us to reopen but for our suppliers. But -- it's not a good situation over there. And I think it's questionable how it's overall being managed. But for us, we need to just keep -- keep heads down, being compliant and pushing for reopening, and it's also having a knock-on effect on logistics. So, we do believe it's a timing issue. Like Patrick said, it could impact us a couple $100 million or so this quarter. We would expect it to recover as we get into 3Q. We do show an ability where there are shutdowns throughout COVID that we recover very quickly, and I'd expect the same to happen in China. Most of our product for China is for China or the Asia Pacific. Some things come into the U.S., but much less. But we really are pushing very hard for a rapid reopening in Shanghai, not only for China, but for the global market. JoeRitchie: Yes. That was super helpful. I guess maybe one quick one, a quick follow-up on China. And then just if you're thinking about the kind of like proper decremental margin on the lost revenues? Is it kind of like a 25% to 30% range? And then the follow-on question, just on margins. But clearly, you're off to a better start than the annual guide. And so just any possible cadence that you can kind of give us throughout the year on kind of margin expansion to get to that 75 basis point number by year-end. Patrick Goris : Yes, I'll start with the second half of the -- of your question, Joe. We think that Q2 and Q3 margins will be ahead of Q1, and Q4 will be slightly below where we were in Q1. That's our current cadence where we're looking at from a margin perspective. And as I mentioned on Steve's question, we do believe that Q2 margins may be slightly below where we were last year. And then on the decrementals related specific to China, we have really not shared what our incremental or decrementals are in that part of the world. So that's really not something I can get into. Operator : Your next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : I'd like to keep the spotlight on some of the troubled geographies. I saw you took a $9 million impairment charge in Russia. What does that represent in terms of your investment, either assets receivable, people. And then for EMEA, orders up 10% to 15%, but there is concern now about slowing, and how much have you baked in that into your guidance? Patrick Goris : Yes, Deane, I'll take the first one very quickly. Yes, you're right, we brought off $9 million of assets related to Ukraine and Russia. In essence, that is, we believe, all, if not most of our assets in that part of the world. So basically, we decided to look at all the assets we have in that part of the world and wrote these off. There might be a little bit of a hangover in Q2. But if it is, it's going to be in the few million dollars. We don't expect it to be higher than that. David Gitlin : Deane, on Europe. Keep in mind that last year when we had Chubb, it was close to 30% of our sales. And now without Chubb, it's closer to 22% of our sales. So Europe has become less exposure for us. What I will tell you is that we're watching this very carefully, but Q1 orders were very strong. They were up double digits. April orders have continued to be strong for us in Europe. So there's no tangible signs of weakness. But obviously, with everything going on in the world, we'll continue to watch it quite carefully. Deane Dray : That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, can you update us on any lost sales or past due because of supply chain issues. In the fourth quarter, I think it was $300 million to $400 million, you couldn't ship. What would be the comparable number this quarter? And you talked about missing components. We know that's an issue everywhere. But can you give any color in terms of which components and especially on the semiconductor side. David Gitlin : Yes. The number of overdue to our customer demand is about the same number as what you mentioned for 4Q. It's in the few hundred million dollar range that we could ship if we didn't have any supply chain issues. The root of a lot of our issues, I would tell you, 2/3 of our issue are chips. Chips cannot recover fast enough and they continue to be extremely painful for us. So I do believe our team is doing all the right things, which gives us some level of optimism as we get towards the second half of this year into next year. The things that we're doing to help ourselves as we get into 2H are, number one, the direct relationships with many of our key chip OEMs like TI and Microchip and STMicro and those. And they're doing their best to support us where I know they have a lot of customers that are pushing on them, but we're really establishing these direct relationships.  And then, we're really -- we're redesigning many of our key chips. So we will have 30% of our critical IC's redesigned by the end of this quarter here in Q2 and then 50% by year-end. So that gives us a lot more optionality where we redesign around chips that are actually available. So that gives us some level of optimism while we wait for the capacity of our chip OEMs to come online in '23. But supplier on-time delivery and line stoppages, it's about what we've seen. There are some signs of hope. But chips are not only impacting us, they're impacting our suppliers as well. So that's the biggest thing that we need to watch in terms of availability. Deane Dray : That's great. I just would like to point out, it's more of a comment that, that sounds to us like some of the fastest redesign pace that we've heard that OEs are trying to do. So it sounds like you're making good progress there. David Gitlin : Well, we have a small army working on it globally. It's something that -- it's unfortunate, honestly, because what we've had to do is reallocate engineers that we want working on new product introduction to redesigning chips; so it is what it is. I think our engineering and operations teams are doing all the right things, but this cannot recover quickly enough. Operator : Your next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Good start to the year. Maybe shifting gears a little bit. Question around the Fire & Security margin expectations for the balance of the year. Clearly, Q1, much better than you guys initially thought. I think it was actually guided down year-over-year in Q1. I didn't hear the 16% again for the full year, but assume that probably is still in the right ballpark. Just maybe help us understand how the rest of the year looks for Fire & Security from a margin perspective? Patrick Goris : Yes, John. As you said, good start to the year. And if I look at the margins versus where we expected it to be, volume was a little bit better in that segment, but the big driver was price/cost. We -- price/cost in that segment was better than where we expected. So a good start to the year, but still too early for us to change our full year outlook. Clearly, there is an upward, call it, pressure in a good way to our margins in this segment, but still early in the year. And as I mentioned earlier, we're still seeing increasing inflationary headwinds. So good start to the year, better-than-expected price/cost, 16% clearly on path to do a little bit better than that, but too early for us to change our guidance. John Walsh : Got you. No, that makes sense. And then maybe just a question around if you're seeing any market share shifts. I know one quarter is tough to kind of extrapolate, but applied, you've put up some really good growth. Curious if you think you're gaining share. I know that was an initiative. And then 1 of your competitors on Light commercial, I guess, kind of walked away from some new build stuff. I'm curious kind of what you're expecting there, and if you're seeing any market share shifts in either of those businesses? David Gitlin : Yes. Light commercial, I think it's clear we've gained significant share, by the way, while raising prices significantly. So -- we saw, I would tell you, over 400 basis points of share over the last year or so, and that continued into 1Q. We saw about 100 -- over 100 basis points of share gain in Q1. So proud of the team on Light commercial because it's been pricing, it's been operational performance, it's been innovation, it's been customer stickiness, it's been all the things that we push and the team is executing well in a strong market. And Applied is probably flattish; I think we've seen some share gains in China and North America, and Europe's may be slightly less than what we thought. But overall, I would tell you, Applied share is probably flattish in 1Q. Operator : Your next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Tommy Moll : I wanted to continue on the global applied HVAC business, so up mid-teens in the quarter, which is good to see. But what commentary can you give us about which parts of the world were on the stronger versus weaker side of that trend? And then as you think through for the rest of 2022, how do you see those trends unfolding? Or does the business feel like it's accelerating or kind of holding a good level of activity? How do you see that unfolding? David Gitlin : Yes. In the first quarter, Tommy, North America was the strongest. That was up around 20%, Europe was around 10% and Asia was around 10%. So overall, around 15% in the first quarter. We've sort of said high single digits across the board for the rest of the year, but we're going to have to keep an eye on it. China is the biggest watch item right now. China would probably be down for us in the second quarter because we do have a couple of facilities in Shanghai that we need to get reopened as soon as possible so we can support our customers. The good news on Overall Applied is; Number one, the underlying trends that we talked about at the beginning of the call, the underlying demand remains very strong. ABI metrics, as we mentioned, stays very strong. Aftermarket for HVAC up over 10%, the ALC/Controls business, high margins, really differentiated product lines that doesn't get enough credit, up double digits. So a lot of strength, especially in some key verticals like data centers and warehouse, education, health care, commercial buildings coming back online. So a lot to like there. I would tell you the one thing we got to watch very acutely right now is China. Tommy Moll : Dave, that's helpful. Following up on M&A, noted Toshiba is on track to close by 3Q, I think you said. Is it safe to assume we're not likely to see another large-scale deal this year? And then a related point on potentially smaller scale investments, you recently announced the Venture Capital Group, and there were a couple of deals underneath that umbrella already. But what kind of cadence do you expect for those type of investments? And what's some of the underlying strategy you could highlight for us there? David Gitlin : Well, on the first, we continue to have plenty of cash and firepower for more M&A. So we're actively working our pipeline along the lines of what we talked about at our Investor Day with a huge focus on sustainability leadership, things that relate to aftermarket and our overall trends. So if we had the right deal, could we do a deal, obviously, north of $1 billion, we certainly could and would if it made sense. In terms of our Carrier ventures, we were very excited to launch it and announced a couple of important deals with OhmConnect and AddVolt, one on the energy management side, one on batteries as we think about our reefer [ph] unit.  So right in the core of what we're focused on, -- and we have a pipeline, Jennifer Anderson and the team working a pipeline of a number of interesting investments we're looking at. And the cadence will be opportunistic and episodic. So -- it's not that we've set aside a certain budget for that team. These are typically around $5 million type investments. And if we see the right investments there, we'll make them. Patrick, anything to add to that? Patrick Goris : No. Operator : Your next question comes from Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Vlad Bystricky : So, I just wanted to dig in on the strength you're seeing in the K-12 market a little. I think you said orders up 50% year-over-year or over 50% over year. So, can you just talk about how that market is evolving as Federal funds become more available? I mean, are you seeing -- is it sort of more broadening of orders? Or are you seeing larger, longer-duration district-wide type deployments accelerating? David Gitlin : Yes, we're seeing a transition to a more system-level sales. So, we had a key win recently, Vlad, in Ohio, for example, where we sold a broad suite of solutions. It included HVAC and included building management systems. They had some UV light upgrades to the school. So, we're seeing a transition. We were very fortunate to sell a bunch of OptiClean units and point solutions, and we're seeing a transition to more sustainable system-level solutions. Because what we're seeing from the school district is the realization that ventilation not only helps with things like indoor air quality and -- but 1 in 13 kids in schools have asthma. So obviously, it's important for COVID and the spread of airborne illnesses and diseases, but it also helps with asthma. It helps with cognitive functionality. We've done studies to show that better ventilation and lower CO2 levels, improve testing scores in schools. So, what we're seeing from the schools that we interact with is looking for a more structural, sustainable solution. And the good news is with -- especially with SR3 funds being released, they have the funding to make long overdue investments. Vlad Bystricky : That's helpful. And it sounds like some good momentum that should be ongoing and continuing there. So that's exciting. Maybe just 1 follow-up for me, shifting to your productivity efforts. And I know your comments on sort of adding an additional 100,000 factory automation hours in 1Q was interesting, and you've talked about ramping that significantly through 2026. So just given what you've seen in the deployments you've done to date, is there a way that you can frame, sort of, how you're thinking about automation's impact on productivity annually over the next few years as you ramp those efforts? David Gitlin : Well, remember, what we said is that we said that we would increase our automation hours from 3 million to 6 million over the next -- between now and 2026. And remember, that's on a base of, say, 30 million or so manufacturing hours. So, it becomes a much higher percentage of our total hours. Obviously, you have to look at your variable costs that you're eliminating and replacing with automated hours. Obviously, there's an investment that goes with that. But you also see benefits around quality and some of the other things that get into other benefits and things. So, there's a lot of benefits that we're seeing from the automation investments. And we expect that to continue and continue at a pretty good clip. Anything you want to add, Patrick? Patrick Goris : No. Operator : Your next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Jack Ayers : This is Jack Ayers on for Gautam today. I guess kind of just going back to the first question, I believe, on the resi HVAC cycle. I guess if you could maybe just provide your perspective on kind of what you're seeing. I know you guys got pretty good price yield this quarter. I guess like is there any concern going forward on the consumer behavior, maybe mixing down buying parts versus full system replacement. I guess just any color there would be helpful. David Gitlin : We've seen no evidence of that. It's something -- again, we watch this market, which is -- evolves on such a short cycle. We watch it very, very carefully. We've seen no evidence of mixing down. In fact, we've seen the opposite, a lot of desire for our higher-end Infinity systems. We've seen no evidence of replacing components versus entire systems. So, we'll have to watch it. Obviously, as you get into the higher SEER units, you're probably going to be looking at more system-level changes. And then as we get into 2025 with a new refrigerant, probably more system-level changes. So -- it's something we watch, but we've seen no evidence of. Jack Ayers : Okay. Okay. That's definitely helpful. And then I guess just kind of switching gears to commercial, if I can just sneak another one in. I guess, like given the backdrop with rates going up, inflation kind of increasing here. Just at commercial, like orders were strong this quarter. comps are a little bit easier. We're still fairly early cycle here in commercial. I guess like when do you guys expect to see some of these macro backdrop sort of manifest themselves in some of these commercial orders? David Gitlin : While the underlying trends remain strong, our backlog is up in commercial, up of 30%. Orders up mid-teens again. Underlying trends like ABI, I think March was at the highest levels we've seen in over a year at 58%. So, we'll keep an eye on it. Again, we're specifically watching China right now. But a lot of the underlying trends, including things like aftermarket and controls continue to be encouraging. Operator : The next question is from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Brett Linzey : Just wanted to come back to the chip redesigns and the progress you've seen on dual sourcing. Are you able to size how much revenue you think was held back this year, or at least last couple of quarters as a result of supply limitations? And how much of that unserved business now really shift to '23 as you get that chip capacity up and running? David Gitlin : Well, we'll have to see. What we've sized it at is a few hundred million of overdue to customer demand because of supply chain shortages. And 2/3 of that of our overdue relates to chips. How quickly we recover on that, we'll have to see. And then how much is this year and how much goes into next year, we're going to have to see if it's a fluid situation, Brett. But I can tell you that our team, I believe, is working all the right things, frankly, working around the clock in a very, very challenging environment. And it's not just chips, it's logistics. Some of the input material continues to be challenging. But at the same time, I do think our team is doing the right things. The key for, I think, the entire industry is chip capacity coming online as soon as possible. And some of the logistics dysfunctionality getting improved. Patrick Goris : Brett, I would just add that, especially within Fire & Security, we are counting on some of the, call it, the backlog -- the past due backlog to improve in the second half of the year. And we are working on improving our supply chain and availability of chips, as Dave mentioned. And so, we are expecting some of that to turn into sales in the second half of the year, particularly in the F&S segment. Brett Linzey : Got it. Makes sense. And just 1 follow-up on F&S, orders very strong on the product side, up 20%. Was hoping you could maybe unbundle that between Fire versus Security and then really residential versus commercial, industrial, fairly balanced or any outliers there? David Gitlin : No. I mean, it's been positive. Commercial Fire was up 20% plus. Industrial Fire is doing very well as POG comes kind of back. Residential Fire did very well. The issue that we have to really watch is the Access Solutions piece because they're most reliant on chips. So, demand has been strong in the Access Solutions piece, we're very well positioned. But the key is that operationally, we need more chips online so they can start recovering. And that happens to be quite a high margin business for us. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes our Q&A session for today. I will pass it back to management for any final remarks. David Gitlin : Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. First, thanks to our team here at Carrier, our more than 50,000 people globally. Really proud of how the team has started this year and continues to execute despite the headwinds that get thrown our way. So very proud of our team, and thanks to all of you for joining. And of course, Sam will be available for any follow-up questions. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you. Operator : And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we conclude our program for today. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. I would like to now introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. Except as otherwise noted, the company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-recurring and/or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items. The company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Once the call is opened up for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to give everyone the opportunity to participate. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by saying how proud I am of the Carrier\u2019s team ability to deliver strong results amidst the current backdrop of inflation, continued supply chain challenges and COVID lockdowns overseas. Our team's hard work, fueled by our high-performance culture, resulted in another quarter of solid organic sales and adjusted operating profit growth, capping a strong first half and enabling us to raise our full year adjusted EPS guidance. Looking specifically at our Q2 results on slide two, we delivered 7% organic sales growth, expanded operating margins by 130 basis points and increased adjusted operating profit by 4% year-over-year despite the Chubb divestiture. Price/cost was positive in the quarter, and we now expect to be price/cost positive for the year. Our backlog is up 20% compared to last year. Aftermarket performed particularly well and was up double digits. Free cash flow improved meaningfully compared to last quarter, but was the use of cash. Turning to slide three, the value creation framework that we outlined at our Investor Day has not changed, driving above-market organic growth, expanding margins, delivering strong free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation. We recognize that there are concerns about slowing economies. In such times, we do not need a new playbook. We doubled down on the playbook that we have. We are focused on controlling the controllables, and our track record demonstrates that we execute in the face of challenges. We are playing offense, investing in growth, particularly digitally enabled aftermarket solutions. We have effectively driven price and aggressively driven cost out of the system, and our strong balance sheet provides us with plenty of flexibility for value-added capital deployment, including investments that will benefit from the compelling multiyear secular trends of healthy and sustainable environment as you see on slide four. Indoor air quality is critical to our health, safety and cognitive performance. Studies show that improved ventilation and filtration reduce the spread of microscopic particulates including COVID, by up to 80%. But IAQ does more than prevent the spread of airborne illnesses. 8% of children suffer from asthma and improved ventilation in schools reduces their symptoms. Students also performed better with improved indoor air quality, 60% of K-12 classrooms have inadequate ventilation today. Studies show that cognitive performance improves by 2x, when optimizing CO2 and VOC levels. Proper filtration systems are equally important and can prevent harmful outside air, whether from forest fires or pollution, from entering the classroom or the home. IAQ is no longer a nice-to-have. It's critical to our health and safety and our ability to perform. We are responding to the challenge. K-12 orders were up over 35% in the first half of the year. In Q2, we saw a 20% year-over-year increase in healthy building orders, and the pipeline remains at over $800 million. Some key wins include a new US theme park featuring air handling units, antimicrobial coating and UV light technology at an industrial manufacturing facility upgrade in China with air handling units and HEPA filtration.  Carrier also won the opportunity to partner with a large school district in North Carolina to provide holistic HVAC solutions for three new schools that were prioritized into air quality. Customers not only want healthy air environments in their schools, office buildings and restaurants, but also in their homes. And our diversified portfolio offers unique solutions.  For example, our Kidde business recently introduced a series of smart, healthy and connected products that includes the industry's first integrated smoke, carbon monoxide and indoor air quality detectors. We are also excited about our recent Healthy Homes partnership with Procter & Gamble. We will start by educating our respective consumers on the benefits of healthy homes with a vision towards joint marketing and promotion activities in the future. On sustainability, the last nine years rank among the 10 warmest years on record. Recently, we saw record temperatures in the UK and Germany, where less than 5% of homes have air conditioning. Demand for AC is increasing in those countries and we are poised to support this demand in a sustainable manner. Addressing increased demand for air conditioning with sustainable solutions is critical to help reduce emissions and fight climate change. Therefore, we remain committed to providing innovative energy-efficient solutions using low GWP refrigerants and coupling them with digital capabilities to optimize asset utilization and energy efficiency. A proof point of our progress on differentiated solutions is in our North American light commercial business, where our rooftop units will now feature our innovative EcoBlue technology. This technology improves performance and efficiency, while decreasing installation and maintenance costs through our exclusive patented beltless direct drive vein axial fan system, an industry first for rooftop units. Our units equipped with EcoBlue are up to 40% more energy efficient compared to the industry's traditional belt drive fans in a similar footprint, a real game changer. It's the same with heating, where various factors are driving an accelerated shift away from fossil fuels and toward heat pump solutions. This shift presents a significant opportunity and we start from a position of strength. We have the market-leading position in European commercial heat pumps, and are the leading player in residential and light commercial heat pumps in North America with over 30% of our residential split today comprising heat pumps.  We are also investing in effective and low-temperature heat pump solutions. We have successfully completed all of the requirements for the Department of Energy's residential cold climate heat pump challenge, where we validated a coefficient of performance higher than 2.1 at an ambient temperature of 5 degrees Fahrenheit, and we are now commercializing that solution for market introduction. Including the heat pump revenues of Toshiba Carrier, an acquisition that we expect to close in early August, we will have about $2 billion of annual heat pump revenues globally and we are confident that the combination of Toshiba Carrier, Giwee, and our Riello business in Italy will enable us to grow in the European residential heat pump market with compelling product offerings. We see the same shift to electrification in our transport refrigeration business with demand for our all-electric vector equal units steadily increasing. Dawson Group, along with many other transport companies, added Carrier Transicold Vector eco units to their fleet to be more efficient and sustainable. We are expanding our market leadership position in this space. Regarding digitalization, we continue to enhance our Abound and Lynx platforms to further differentiate our life cycle solution offerings. Abound continues to gain traction in verticals ranging from commercial office and university buildings to data centers to national retailers with our focus remaining on providing scale customers with the solutions that they desire. Our Advanced Lynx Digital platform aimed at significantly improving the cold chain through enhanced visibility and increased connectivity received a silver ranking from the Edison Awards for excellence in supply chain innovation. Like Abound, we are adding new features to Lynx. Our recent Lynx fleet rollout incorporates customer feedback and provides key alerts and metrics around fuel and battery levels and asset run hours. These notifications shown in a summary dashboard, helped to minimize unit downtime and low loss, ultimately reducing our customers' operational costs. We remain on track to have 100,000 Lynx subscriptions by the end of this year. Another critical growth driver is higher-margin aftermarket and recurring revenues, which you see on slide five. Aftermarket has been up double-digits through the first half of the year, and we're on track for another year of double-digit growth. All of our three segments saw double-digit aftermarket growth in Q2. Commercial HVAC is now up to over 15,000 connected chillers, putting us ahead of schedule for 20,000 connected chillers this year. We also remain on track for 70,000 chillers under BluEdge LTAs by the end of this year. In residential and light commercial, the team continues to see expanded adoption of the Breeze platform by new national account customers to playbook is working. Before I turn it over to Patrick, a bit more color on the Toshiba Carrier acquisition on slide six. TCC's technology positions us well to accelerate the VRF international light commercial and heat pump opportunities. TCC's pioneering inverter technology, coupled with its rotary compressors allow for dynamic and intelligent balancing of air-conditioning demand, thereby providing customers with greater energy efficiency, longer life and quieter system operation. We will deploy our multi-brand, multichannel strategy to further penetrate critical markets. And our complementary global footprints, and supply chains give us confidence in achieving run rate synergies of $100 million. We created a new business unit within the HVAC segment, Global Comfort Solutions, with a strong leadership team based in Tokyo. Global Comfort Solutions will include the TCC and Giwee acquisitions, as well as our European Riello business and the light commercial business outside of North America. The team has been working on detailed execution plans, and collectively, we're ready to go. With that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 7. Reported sales of $5.2 billion were down as expected due to the Chubb divestiture. Currency translation was a higher than expected headwind of 3%. All segments grew organically in the quarter, resulting in 7% organic growth for the total company. The impact of the Shanghai lockdowns on Q2 sales was in line with our expectations, roughly $100 million. All segments realized significant price in the quarter more than offsetting higher than anticipated inflation. Q2 adjusted operating profit was up 4%, compared to last year despite lower reported sales. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter includes the benefit of about $35 million or $0.03 of favorable onetime items. Our results included gains on the sale of two Toshiba Carrier joint ventures and one refrigeration joint venture. These transactions are consistent with our plans to simplify Carrier and reduce the number of minority owned joint ventures. Even excluding these onetime items, operating profit was stronger than expected, mainly as a result of productivity and better price cost despite currency headwinds. Q2 adjusted operating margin was up 130 basis points, compared to last year, whereas price/cost was positive in Q2, it was still dilutive to margins. Adjusted EPS of $0.69 was stronger than expected, mainly due to better than expected margins. For your reference, we have a year-over-year Q2 adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix on slide 17. Free cash flow was the use of $34 million. We paid about $70 million of taxes on the gain related to the Chubb sale in Q2. In addition, stronger than expected sales in June, particularly the second half of June, led to higher receivables. Inventories were relatively flat sequentially. Supply chain challenges have not yet subsided and continue to affect our inventory levels. Starting with slide 8, we will cover our segment's performance in more detail. HVAC organic sales were up 8%, driven by double-digit growth in residential and our ALC controls businesses. Q2 resi movement was flat. After the weak May, movement was up very strong in June. Residential HVAC growth was driven by price. Our light commercial business was down mid-single digits due to supply chain challenges and a tough comparison as Q2 of last year grew over 60%. Light commercial demand remains very strong. As we expected, commercial HVAC saw modest low single-digit growth in the quarter due to the impact from the Shanghai lockdowns. Adjusted operating profit for the HVAC segment was up 5% compared to last year driven by strong productivity, favorable price cost and the higher equity income from the TCC gains I mentioned earlier, which are reflected in equity income in this segment. Operating margin was down 70 bps compared to last year, mainly due to the impact of price cost and lower volumes, which offset strong productivity and the margin impact of the onetime gains. We expect the HVAC segment to remain price cost positive for the full year. The consolidation of TCC will dilute margins of this segment by about 100 basis points this year as we will no longer record equity income related to TCC, but instead will consolidate its entire income statement and incur about $20 million in upfront integration costs. Our current expectation of HVAC's full year 2022 operating margin is, therefore, about 15%. Moving to refrigeration on slide nine, organic sales were up 9% in the quarter, driven by high single-digit growth for both transport and commercial refrigeration. This is despite an almost 40% reduction in China refrigeration sales related to the lockdowns and related project delays. Within transport refrigeration, container was up low single-digits on top of last year's almost 40%. North America and Europe truck trailer saw double-digit growth as some of the component shortages that held up deliveries in Q1 were resolved in Q2. Sensitech continues to deliver solid results as it grew low teens in the quarter. Adjusted operating margins were up 230 basis points compared to last year, mainly due to volume, productivity improvements, and the small one-time gain on the sale of a joint venture. Commercial refrigeration margins were up almost 300 basis points sequentially. We are pleased with the progress this segment made in the quarter. Moving on to Fire & Security on slide 10, excluding Chubb's sales from the second quarter of 2021, Fire & Security segment sales were up 4%. Adjusted operating margins expanded 310 basis points in the quarter, mainly because of the Chubb divestiture and strong productivity. Price/cost was positive in this segment as well. Slide 11 provides more details on orders performance. Total company organic orders were flattish for the quarter. Backlog remains at very healthy levels throughout all segments. As we expected, residential HVAC and transport refrigeration orders were down in the quarter as both businesses continue to proactively manage their order book. Backlog for both resi and North America truck trailer refrigeration continued to grow sequentially. Light commercial orders were up about 25% in the quarter, signaling continued strong demand in that business. Commercial HVAC also saw solid continued demand in the quarter, marking its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit orders growth with growth across all regions and backlog up about 20% and compared to last year. Refrigeration orders were down approximately 20% in the quarter. The segment's backlog remains up almost 10% year-over-year with transport refrigeration backlog of mid-teens along with a slight decline in commercial refrigeration backlog as we are very much focused on profitability of that business. Demand for Fire & Security products remains healthy up about 10% to 15%. As you can see on the right side, order activity was flattish in the Americas and down in EMEA. China orders were down in the quarter, primarily due to the Shanghai lockdowns, but the Asia region, excluding China, saw strong demand. Before talking about guidance, I wanted to provide an update on capital deployment. In the quarter, we repurchased about $275 million worth of shares, consistent with our plan to complete the remaining authorization by the end of the year. Year-to-date, we've repurchased about $1 billion. We borrowed approximately $400 million under the yen denominated term loan earlier this week that will be used to partially fund the $900 million TCC acquisition. The balance will be funded by cash. Consistent with what we shared with you in February, our full year debt reduction will be about $750 million. The divestitures I referred to earlier, further simplify our portfolio and are expected to yield approximately $75 million in after-tax proceeds, which we expect to collect in the second half of the year. Our actions will continue to be consistent with the capital deployment priorities we laid out at our Investor Day, and our balance sheet provides plenty of flexibility for continued balanced value-add capital deployment. Now moving on to guidance on slide 12. Performance in the first half of 2022 has been better than expected. In addition, our updated guidance now includes the impact of consolidating TCC into our financials. Last quarter, I mentioned that we expected price to exceed $1 billion for 2022. We now expect the year-over-year impact from price to be closer to $1.5 billion. The additional revenue from price will be mostly offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation and slightly lower volume as a result of supply chain challenges. We expect the TCC acquisition to add about $800 million in revenues this year. With that, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance range $0.05 to $2.25 to $2.35. This is primarily due to the strong performance year-to-date, lower net interest expense and a lower share count, offset by a headwind from foreign exchange. The earnings impact of higher price is largely offset by increased input costs. We do not expect an adjusted EPS impact from TCC this year, as operating profit contribution is expected to be mostly offset by the loss of equity income and integration costs. As we expected, excluding the equity income from these joint ventures and consolidating the income statement, we will reduce full year 2022 operating margin by about 30 to 40 basis points. In addition, because equity income is our share of after-tax income, consolidating TCC will increase our effective tax rate for the full year 2022 by about 25 to 50 basis points. Importantly, this does not change our actual tax expense or the dollars of income, but only changes the tax rate calculation. We continue to expect to generate approximately $1.65 billion in free cash flow this year. Achieving this target has become more challenging, given continued supply chain headwinds, but the team is focused on better working capital performance in the second half. Lastly, as we shared in the press release this morning, effective with the close of TCC we will exclude the impact of intangible amortization related to M&A activity from Carriers' adjusted operating profit, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. The nature of this acquisition requires us to step up the value of the 60% economic interest in the joint venture we already own, which would drive unusually high amortization. We believe this adjustment provides investors better information to evaluate our operating performance. We estimate the full year 2022 adjusted earnings will now exclude about $20 million or $0.02 of intangible amortization related to acquisitions compared to our prior guidance. For your benefit, we included a guide-to-guide adjusted EPS bridge on slide 18. So overall, another good quarter and an improved outlook for 2022. With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Dave. David Gitlin : Well, thanks, Patrick. We are pleased with our performance through the first half of the year. Our backlog instills confidence in our outlook for the second half, and I am confident in our team's ability to keep driving strong results. With that, we'll open this up for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. David Gitlin : Good morning, Joe. Patrick Goris : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey, guys. So -- nice quarter. I'm curious, just -- maybe just parse out the resi HVAC this quarter. It looks like all of it was price. I just want to understand how much pricing is coming through, not just there, but also across the rest of your HVAC business? Was the volume -- was there any volume growth in the business this quarter? And then the other key thing that I'd like to parse out is that, as commodities are deflating right now, how do you guys feel about your ability to keep that price? And how will that play kind of translate into margins going forward? David Gitlin : Let me start with the latter piece, and then Patrick can discuss the pricing on the first part. Our goal, Joe, is to keep the price increases that we've gotten. You'll recall we came into the year expecting $1 billion of pricing this year, which about $20 billion of sales would have been about 5%. We're now looking at $1.5 billion of price, which is a 7.5% or so realization for the year. And our expectation is that we maintain that price, not just in resi, but across the portfolio. In some parts of the business, we needed more discipline in any case on pricing, like in our commercial refrigeration business where the team has done a nice job. So our expectation is that we certainly retain price as we get into the second half of this year, into next year. And then we'll see about the commodities. If they continue to come down, things like copper, steel and aluminum, that should be some tailwind as we get into next year, but we'll have to see on that piece. But we're pretty well blocked for the second half of this year, but our hope and expectation is that, if they remain low, it would be a bit of a tailwind as we get into 2023. Patrick Goris : So, Joe, on the first part of your question, for the HVAC segment, most of the organic growth was price. And so volume was actually slightly negative there. And that's, of course, impacted by the commercial HVAC performance, which was, as we expected, we've given the Shanghai lockdown. And we expect commercial HVAC growth to pick up in the second half of the year. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then -- and you guys commented that, it sounds like things started to pick up in the June timeframe. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about the trends as you were exiting the quarter? And then as -- obviously, it's still pretty early in 3Q, but as we kind of had started the July timeframe. David Gitlin : Yeah. What we saw in resi in particular, was movement really picked up as we got into June. June movement was up around 10%, and it had been a bit weaker in April and May. So -- that was a movement in resi something that we watch very, very carefully. And it was encouraging to see movement pick up in June. That's continued into July, which is encouraging because our expectation for ourselves is that we end the year with inventory levels about in balance to where we\u2019d expect them to be. So we are trying very hard to manage the inventory levels in the channel, while supporting our customers. So it's nice to see movement fairly strong over the last couple of months. In other parts of the business, a lot of it really had to do with just us recovering on the supply chain a bit more as we got into June. We've still been paced by chips, which is about two-thirds of our problem. In parts of our business like transport refrigeration, we saw controls catching up as we got into the latter part of the quarter, and that helped us with output as we got into June. Joe Ritchie : Helpful. Thanks guys. David Gitlin : Thank you. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your question please. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just a first question around the orders outlook. So the orders were flattish in Q2 after what had been four or five quarters of extreme strength. So just wondered if the orders development was broadly in line with what you were thinking, how we should think about that orders year-on-year trend in the back half. And I suppose particularly interested in transport refrigeration, where I think the ACT data has been fine. You obviously had a pretty steep decline in orders. So maybe how are you thinking about that in particular as well for the back half on orders? David Gitlin : Yeah, Julian, let me give some color on orders. If you take about half of our business, orders were up double digits. Commercial HVAC has been up double digits now for six quarters in a row. So we're very pleased with the orders that we're seeing in commercial HVAC. And they're underlying it is that we look at ABI, which you know the Architectural Billing Index has been north of 50 for 17 straight months. So that's very encouraging. Our F&S business, which doesn't get as many questions, they had double-digit orders. Like commercial had double-digit orders. I think it was in the range of 25%. So there was more of a supply chain issue supporting the output, but orders have been extremely strong in light commercial. The real two areas that kind of gave Carrier an overall flattish was resi and truck trailer. On resi, we usually measure backlog in terms of weeks, say, four weeks or so in terms of backlog. We're sitting at about four months. So as backlog normalizes, we've been saying now for many quarters in a row that we expect year-over-year orders to come down for resi and that is not the metric that we track. We track movement, we track inventory levels. We expect orders to decline, but we're still sitting on very strong backlog. And in truck trailer to your -- the specific question there, we have been managing the order book, especially in North American truck trailer with our customers. So it's something that we're very well-positioned in terms of our backlog in truck trailer. We watch those ACC metrics for next year. I think it used to be in the double-digit range. It's probably high single digits is what they're saying for right now but the backlog is good. So the two areas, resi truck trailer are things that we're being quite purposeful in. And then we expected container to be down, and it was down given the very, very tough compares. And the last thing I'll mention is CCR. CCR orders were challenged a bit, but what we have to figure out is how much of that is driven by the market and how much is driven by us. We were very clear with our team that we expect to improve margins on CCR and we're going to bid things at the right margins, and we're not going to bid things at the wrong margin. So we did see orders decline a little bit, but we also saw a significant improvement in margins, which is encouraging to see. So, Julian, we're sitting on backlog levels that are up 20 -- more than 20% over last year. So, we will continue to watch orders in light of what everyone is concerned about with economic slowdowns. But for us, what we see is nothing less than what we expected in some cases, actually beyond what we expected. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s helpful Dave. Thank you. And then maybe just a question on the -- we can see what the sort of second half EPS implied in the full year guidance is. Just wonder if there's any points you'd highlight around the sort of split of earnings between the third and fourth quarter? Any dynamic in terms of margin trends year-on-year perhaps between Q3 and Q4 because of price cost, for example. Patrick Goris : Yes, so Julian, Patrick here. We actually expect organic growth to be pretty similar, Q3 and Q4, about close to 10% each, maybe a little bit below. And then -- which is not unusual. We expect a little over 50% of our second half of the year to be in Q3. So a little bit higher EPS in Q3 than Q4 similar overall growth rate. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thanks Patrick. Patrick Goris : Thanks Julian. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your question please. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Good morning Dave, Patrick, and Sam. David Gitlin : Good morning. Nigel Coe : Good morning. Lot to have this morning. Sorry, Patrick, I didn't quite understand the amortization point. Are we now sort of on a -- for FY 2022 on a cash EPS basis. And the principle of my question is the add back, you've got a lot more amortization through your P&L. So, I'm not quite sure why it's $0.02, not something a little bit higher than that. So, if you can just clarify that, that would be great. Patrick Goris : Sure. Hi Nigel. The way you can think about this is in our current P&L and our outlook we had back in April, we had about $0.02 for the full year amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions. With the acquisition of TCC, our amortization expense will likely go up by about $100 million. And what's kind of interested is, we already own today economically 60% of the overall interest in Toshiba. So, our amortization expense would go up significantly, including for the part that we already own of Toshiba. We have decided to exclude the amortization related to acquisitions going forward, and so compared to the prior guidance, that is a $0.02 improvement in adjusted EPS. Of course, the impact going forward would be significantly higher because of the large increase in amortization expense that I just mentioned. Nigel Coe : Okay. And the reason why we haven't got accretion from Toshiba in the back half of the year, obviously, ex-amortization is because of the integration cost that you're absorbing in the P&L. Okay, that's very clear. Thanks. Patrick.  And then on the step-up in pricing from $1 billion to $1.5 billion, was that due to additional price actions that you didn't have in place as of April, or was it due to just better yields on the announced price increases? David Gitlin : I think it's a bit of both. We came into the year pretty well-priced. We had to do a bit more to get to the $1 billion. And we've actually announced subsequent price increases as the year has gone along. So we announced a recent price increase for our North American commercial, light commercial HVAC business. Refrigeration both Fire & Security have had to announced price increases during the course of the year. And then I will say that our realization has been a bit higher than we had planned. So I think it's a combination of within your price announced increases plus realization. Nigel Coe : And then just based on where commodities are right now, the way they're trending, do you anticipate that we're now beyond the price increases? And maybe if we could just focus more on the residential business here, that would be helpful. Patrick Goris : Nigel, one with respect to copper, steel, aluminum, clearly, we're seeing the trends there. I think it's too early for us to say that some other components, call it, that we purchased for resi HVAC that we've seen in the end of the cost increases. Obviously, that is something that we're very much negotiating. But I don't -- I would not say that besides steel, copper, aluminum, that were on the downward trend. Nigel Coe : Understood. Thanks very much. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Nigel. David Gitlin : Thanks Nigel. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tommy Moll from Stephens. Your question please. Tommy Moll : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. David Gitlin : Hi, Tommyy. Tommy Moll : I wanted to drill down on HVAC margins. If I recall correctly, last quarter, you guided us for this quarter as 2Q down year-over-year, and you gave some factors there. Can you give us any similar insight into 3Q, if not quantitative, then maybe qualitative? Patrick Goris : Well, Tommy, first of all, with respect to Q2, the margins came in a little bit better than we expected. Of course, the gain helped with that. That was about 80 or so bps. But I will also say that for Q2, we still saw a headwind on price cost from a margin perspective. So price cost positive from a dollar operating profit perspective, but price cost for the HVAC segment was still about 100-point headwind on operating margin in the quarter. For the balance of the year, HVAC margins will, of course, be impacted by the consolidation of TCC. We expect for the full year now the margins of HVAC to be down to be closer to 15% versus 16% prior guide. And including for Q3, we still expect a sizable headwind from price cost on HVAC margins. Tommy Moll : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Patrick. And Dave, I wanted to circle back to some of your commentary around orders. You walked us through some of the parts of the business where orders trended down in the second quarter and you gave some reasons why. But you also alluded to what I think a lot of investors are focused on, which is just is there any sign of an economic slowdown that you're seeing in your business? And you gave us some reasons why that might not be the case, just simply looking at your order trends. But are there any macro signs that you can point to that may have moderated a bit or maybe falling short of what you would have expected even if we're not currently seeing it in the orders of the P&L? David Gitlin : The direct answer is not really. I mean, we saw orders decline in China, but we wouldn't blame that on the macro, we would blame that on the COVID-related lockdowns. I think if we had to look for one area that came in a little bit lower than we expected, it was in CCR and to some extent, in European truck trailer orders in the quarter. And I would say a couple of months, it's too early to call a trend. But the thing in particular with CCR that we have to watch is, how much is self-induced because of our pricing discipline and how much is market related. And the true answer is we don't know just yet, because this is probably the most aggressive we've been in that company's history. So we'll have to keep an eye on that. But by and large, North America remains strong. Southeast Asia, which we don't talk a lot about, was extremely strong. China was weak, but we expected it. We'll have to see how the rest of 3Q plays out. And again, resi and truck trailer, it wasn't alarming because a lot of that was us managing the order book and inventory levels. Tommy Moll : Appreciate it, Dave. That\u2019s helpful and I\u2019ll pass it back. David Gitlin : Thanks, Tommy. Patrick Goris : Thanks, Tommy. Operator : Thank you. One moment of our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC. Your question, please. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. David Gitlin : Hey, Deane. Good morning, Deane. Patrick Goris : Good morning. Deane Dray : Hey, Dave, that statistic a lot of headlines with the UK on average household only 5% with some form of air conditioning. How prepared is Carrier for this expected ramp in kind of new capacity? And are you seeing any of that demand given the past couple of months? David Gitlin : Well, it's one of the reasons that we're very excited to close on Toshiba. Toshiba really positions us in that kind of multifamily, in that light commercial space globally in places like Germany and the UK. So obviously, we're not a major player in Europe for single-family homes. But when you get into the multifamily homes, our Toshiba technology, and Giwee to some extent, position us very well. And then for the larger, obviously, commercial HVAC, we would say that we're doing extremely well. So we're positioned well for that demand in Europe. And then it's the same on the heat pump side, which is as we get into these winter months, we would say that we're number one in commercial HVAC heat pumps in Europe, and that's going to be a big trend that people are going to be talking a lot about is the transition to heat pumps in Europe as well. So when you see parts of the world that have never had air conditioning before, whether it's Portland, Oregon and Seattle or now London and Frankfurt, you're going to see us leaning into that AC space, but also with more sustainable solutions as well, because, obviously, we want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem, on climate change. Deane Dray : Yes. That\u2019s great to hear. And then the K-12 opportunity, summer is the prime time for construction activity. So if there should be a lot going on right now. Is there -- how does this compare to previous cycles, especially given the indoor air quality mandate. But I just concern that if -- are there -- is there a shortage of construction labor, parts, anything that might hamper what should be some significant installation time in the cycle over the summer. David Gitlin : Yes, I think that's just a broad macro concern in the US right now is labor constraints. But I think specifically with K-12, I think we're extremely encouraged by it, and I don't think that will put a significant damper on the opportunity. I mean, you think about $190 billion of total ESSER spending for K-12, $140 billion of that $190 billion has not yet been allocated. And because that's because ESR3 is where the bulk will really go towards sort of the larger appropriations and that's of the $120 billion is SR3. So, our orders were up in the first half, 35% in K-12. When we think about verticals that could do well during an economic slowdown, K-12 with the amount of funding they have is one of them. And we put a dedicated team on this space, and they're performing well. So -- we're very encouraged by this space. Deane Dray : All good to hear. Thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you, Deane. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Your question please. Gautam Khanna : Yes, thank you. I have two questions. First, I'm curious about price in elasticity or elasticity in the resi business, given all the price actually the industry has announced and in the face of declining commodities. What do you think -- do you think the industry will be able to hold price next year? And if there is any pricing pressures in the business, where would they emerge? Would it be in commercial? Would it be -- what can you say about that? Then I have a follow-up. David Gitlin : Yes, let me first comment on resi. We've seen -- and I think that the industry has seen an ability to appropriately increase price given all the commodity headwind and retain it. And we think that would continue into next year because what you're going to see next year is a switch over to the 2023 higher SEER units, which is going to come with a 10% to 15% price increase. So, we will have to watch the elasticity curves. I think it's clear to say that we won't continue with the same kind of price rate increases that we've been seeing. I think we've had six increases over the last 18 months or so. And obviously, that will subside, but we do not see today prices declining. In fact, as we get into next year, we'd expect an increase given the SEER shift. But more broadly, I think that all of us have been in a situation with our peers where we've had no choice, but to raise prices. And fortunately, we're in markets where we sell essential products and whether it's life safety equipment or whether it's -- we're transporting critical vaccines or foods to certain parts of the world or whether it's when your air conditioner breaks, when it's really hot outside, you're going to replace it. So, I think we've seen an ability to increase price and retain it, and we do not expect going into next year of price reductions. We'll watch the elasticity curves for sure. But right now, we do not see price decreases. Gautam Khanna : Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up, David, you made some comments early on about supply chain improving and controls. And I just wondered if you could maybe give us some metrics around where the supply chain has gotten better, where it hasn't and what your visibility on the areas are that it happens. How is it going to trend over the next couple of quarters? Thanks. David Gitlin : Yes. What we saw at the end of the second quarter was we were waiting on controls and some of our reefer units that had been in inventory for a while, and we saw those get delivered and we were able to release those units to the field. So, that was encouraging. At a more macro level, we have not seen the sustained improvement on the supply chain that we expect to see yet. We're still dealing with chip issues in a significant way, and that contributes to about two-thirds of our problem. We said last quarter that we would redesign 30% of our critical components by the end of last quarter, 50% by the end of the year. We continue to do that, but we continue to see challenges, not just with chips, but things like motors and other suppliers continue to surprise us. And that does cause productivity issues in the factories, and it does cause us to hurt our customers where today, we are sitting on hundreds of millions of overdue to our customers. So we are counting on supply chain improving as we get into really 4Q leading into next year, and we're going to need that to make sure that we hit our cash numbers in the back half. And we also are still looking at logistics. The good news is that spot rates have come down, the bad news is that because of supply chain challenges, we're having to do a bit more airfreight than usual. So we're anticipating improvement as we get into the back half of this year, and I think the team is doing the right things, but it does continue to be a challenge. Gautam Khanna : Thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your question please. Steve Tusa : Hey guys, good morning. David Gitlin : Hi, Steve. Steve Tusa : So just on the price cost, can you just give us the absolute price and cost numbers for the second quarter? And then you gave us the price for the year, but what's the cost estimate for the year? And then I have a follow-up. Patrick Goris : Yeah, Steve. So in Q1, I said that price was over $300 million. In Q2 price overall company was about $450 million. And it was a price cost positive but still dilutive to margins. So if you do the math, it's maybe a couple of pennies. Steve Tusa : And then for the year, what are you expecting now on cost, I think it was $1 billion before? What are you expecting now on cost? Patrick Goris : We expect price to be about $1.5 billion. And again, we expect price cost to be positive, it's going to be pennies, it's not going to be a dime. So it's below that and still price on margin dilutive by about 40 bps for the overall company. Steve Tusa : Got it, got it. Patrick Goris : Just for your info, on a two-year stack, we're about neutral now to slightly positive. Steve Tusa : Right, right. Yeah, that makes sense. And then, Patrick, I think in response to Julian's question, you said the second half would be kind of a 50-50 weighting 3Q, 4Q when it came to EPS. I guess, I'm a little bit surprised because 4Q usually is seasonally weaker, and I just want to make sure I'm doing the math right. That's like $0.55-ish for both quarters. Patrick Goris : Steve, I said to Julian or I mentioned a little over 50%. So I think close to 60-40. Steve Tusa : Okay, that makes a lot more sense. Okay. And then one last one, just for the resi market this year, what's your most -- what's your kind of most up-to-date view on what you expect from the resi market volume-wise for the year? David Gitlin : I would say that volume is going to be up like low single digits. Overall, resi we were up 20% in the first half. Second half will be about 10%. So call the full year about 15%. We had previously said resi was going to be, I think, high single digits. So in that 8% to 10% range, it's now going to be closer to 15%. The bulk of that from price, but we do expect some volume in the low single digits. Steve Tusa : Okay. Awesome. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Your question, please. Andrew Obin : Hi. Yes, good morning. David Gitlin : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question, going back to the whole chip supply, how much visibility do you have into next year? And are you counting more on existing capacity freeing up, coming out of places like Asia, or new incremental capacity being added in North America, how do you think about improving chip supply going forward? What's the biggest driver? David Gitlin : Well, we work with folks, our friends at TI and NXP and Microchip and others. And right now, we are trying to really, for our critical shortages, design around chips that are available. We do know that our partners are building capacity as we get into next year, and that's hopefully going to come on sooner rather than later. I think over time, the CHIPS Act once that goes through, will be beneficial. But for now, it's a fairly tactical exercise around redesigns while we really anxiously anticipate and await the additional capacity coming online next year into 2024. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up on that. It seems that just -- not just for you, but for everybody, the mix is shifting to sort of lower SEER units, just because of chip availability. So how much of a lift structurally on a like-for-like basis, could you get as mix improves, as chips become more available next year and mix improves towards high-end product eventually. How should we think about that impact on the mix down the line? Thanks. Patrick Goris : Actually, Andrew, I think that one of the benefits we may see is with the new regulations. We estimate that over half of the resi market is at the lowest SEER level, with the new regulations in 2023, it means that we think that a little over half of the market will mix up, if you want. Meaning 10% to 15% price increase and from a margin perspective, positive from a margin dollar perspective and at least neutral from a margin percent point of view. And so, we think that may be the biggest driver from a mix shift point of view. Andrew Obin : Right, but that assumes you can get the chips available. Patrick Goris : Yes, but we're already in production for those new units, and we're starting to sell them this month. Andrew Obin : Terrific. Thanks a lot. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Your question, please. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning, everyone. David Gitlin : Hey, John. Patrick Goris : Good morning, John. John Walsh : Hey. So a lot of ground covered on HVAC and refrigeration. I wanted to talk a little bit about the Fire & Security margin. I think last quarter, you kind of suggested you were looking a little bit better than the 16% you had put out there. Wondered if we could just get a little bit of a bridge back H2, H1 on the fire and security margins. Patrick Goris : Yes. Actually, if you look at Fire & Security, there are two items that we expect to benefit us in the second half of the year. One, organic growth rates are expected to be higher for Fire & Security in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. And then the second element is price cost. For Fire & Security, you may recall that in Q1, Fire & Security was price cost neutral. We expect price cost to be favorable in the back half of the year -- for the back half of the year. And so we think that a combination of these two will be the main driver of improved margin performance for that segment. John Walsh : Great. And then just going back to pricing, if we could talk about the commercial pricing in HVAC, is this all structural? Are there any kind of fuel surcharges or things that might reverse out? And then just anything around spares pricing as well there on the commercial side? Thank you. David Gitlin : Yes, we believe structural, we're trying to the best of our ability avoid surcharges or things that are ephemeral in nature. So, it's structural. It's actual price increases that we intend to sustain. And the second part of the question? John Walsh : Just around the ability to also push through on non-contractual pricing outside of service or spare parts at that. David Gitlin : Yes, that's something that we've really tried to be much more intelligent about and using -- creating more algorithms, kind of akin to what was what we used to do a bit more on the aerospace side and really look at the elasticity curves more at a part number level. So, I think the team's gotten much better models on pricing on the parts side. And I think that's been an area that we've had a lot of focus and success with. John Walsh : Great. I'll pass it along. Thanks. David Gitlin : Thanks John. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vlad Bystricky from Citigroup. Your question please. Vlad Bystricky : Morning guys. thanks for taking my call. David Gitlin : Hey Vlad. Vlad Bystricky : So, maybe just as a follow-up on Fire & Security, obviously, a lot of talk about the chip situation. on the HVAC side. But can you talk about the supply chain and electronics component availability in Fire & Security and whether that's any different than what you're seeing on the HVAC side and how you see that resolving? David Gitlin : Yes, I would say, Vlad, it's actually been even more acute for Fire & Security than it has been for HVAC. In particular, in one of our highest margin businesses, which is Access Solutions. We've had very strong demand in parts of that business, whether it's for LenelS2 or our BlueDiamond or even our Onity and Supra businesses, which are quietly very well-positioned businesses, high margin. The team is doing a great job, and we're really plagued by chips in those businesses. And our supplier partners know it. They've been -- working with us to support us, but that's where a lot of our overdue has been. So, we talked about coming into the year, as Patrick said, at about a 16% ROS. The expectation is to be a bit higher than that. And the reliance is on recovering on some of our higher-margin businesses that have been really impacted by chips. We are anticipating a recovery as we get into 4Q there. I mean it's not just it's not just hope. There are specific part numbers that we track that we know when they're going to get redesigned when we line of sight to it, but it has to happen over the next few months. Vlad Bystricky : And that's -- it's good to hear that you have line of sight to some improvement there. I\u2019ll be watching that. I guess just shifting to Toshiba Carrier, obviously, a big deal for you. Can you talk about as you look to close the acquisition in August, what opportunities do you see to do things differently that you couldn't have done under the historical JV construct? And then also any color on the timeline to achieving those $100 million in synergies. David Gitlin : Sure. I got to tell you, we could not be more excited. We said early August, the expectation is here that we closed early next week. So we're gearing up. We're ready to go. The team has been at the integration over the last six months or so. And we've worked very well with Toshiba Corp and the TCC team. What we have found -- and remember that as a JV partner, as a minority JV partner, we didn't really control design or production or really the JV overall. We did some distribution globally. But now as we look at it, we have traveled the world and there is so much demand for this product line. It's got -- this phenomenal inverter technology, which enables you to use rotary compressors, which is lower cost, and it's got really differentiated technology, it has a great brand, especially in countries like China where Toshiba is going to actually be our high-end brand, followed by Carrier and then Giwee. So as we get into things like European heat pumps, especially for residential, we're talking to some of the OEMs there that are really pulling for our compressor and condensing unit designs. We were traveling in the Middle East where we see there's so much excitement and they can't wait for us to close. So I can tell you that the excitement on the product line is building. Toshiba has brand-new facilities, TCC in places like Poland and China that we can really leverage across our portfolio, and there's also phenomenal supply chain opportunities between the two companies. So we said $100 million on a run rate basis over the next, I would say, five years or so. And we're confident that we're going to achieve that. Vladimir Bystricky : Sounds good. Very exciting. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks. David Gitlin : Okay, well, thank you, everyone, for joining in. While I know it's a busy morning, of course, we and Sam are around for questions. So thank you all. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. The company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying how proud I am of this tremendous carrier team, which continues to deliver strong and consistent results. Turning to Slide 2 for a summary of our Q3 results. We delivered 8% organic sales growth on the heels of continued traction on pricing. Total company organic orders were up 3% in the quarter, and our backlog is up about 10% year-over-year. Importantly, we continue to deliver double-digit aftermarket organic growth. Adjusted operating profit was slightly better than we expected, and price cost continues to be positive. We are tracking to about $300 million of gross productivity, about $100 million of which will come from G&A reductions.  We generated strong free cash flow in the quarter of approximately $700 million. Supply chains are generally improving. We have increased dual sourcing for critical components and supplier on-time delivery has meaningfully improved. The improvements, though study have been later in the year than planned, thus impacting our full year free cash flow forecast. As supply chain and working capital improve, we expect to return to 100% free cash flow conversion. We successfully closed the Toshiba Carrier acquisition during the quarter, and we are making important progress on integration and are starting to realize synergies. We still have plenty of capacity for additional value-add capital deployment as our balance sheet remains very solid with approximately $3 billion of cash and no debt maturities until 2025. Earlier this week, our Board approved a $2 billion share repurchase authorization, which is on top of the $300 million remaining on the previous authorization. We are confident in our strategy and long-term prospects and remain committed to delivering shareholder value through disciplined capital allocation, including organic growth investments, M&A, dividends and share buybacks. Moving to Slide 3. I want to again emphasize our commitment to the value creation framework that we presented at our Investor Day earlier this year. Our team remains laser-focused on these four principles of driving above-market organic growth, expanding margins, delivering strong free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation. We have a thorough goal alignment process that cascades our critical focus areas to each of our 55,000 team members individual performance goals. We are making significant progress on our priorities, as you can see on Slide 4. Secular trends continue to drive sticky customer demand and one theme that certainly fits that definition is sustainability. Our customers in both the commercial and residential verticals are motivated to achieve their ESG targets and reduce their carbon footprint and energy bills with government mandates, policies and incentives further fueling this demand. A key sustainability enabler is the shift to electrification in buildings and cold chain distribution. Starting with buildings. In the U.S., the rapid transition to heat pumps will be further accelerated by the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act. Today, over 30% of our residential split sales include heat pumps. In Q3, our residential heat pump shipments were up over 30% compared to last year. We established our Tennessee facility as our North American heat pump center of excellence and are expanding customer financing offerings through our new EcoHome initiative. In addition to heat pumps, we continue to lead through innovation with energy-efficient solutions. The cutover to our differentiated new 2023 SEER 2 compliant units has gone well, and our resi HVAC team has done a great job managing the production and inventory transition. We recently hosted 8,000 Carrier and Bryant dealers in Las Vegas and our industry-leading dealer network is energized about the product lineup. Our new outdoor indoor and outdoor units are complete redesign differentiated in performance, size and weight. In addition, a 45% SKU reduction provides flexibility and operational efficiencies to the channel and to us. We are driving aggressive cost reduction actions and are pricing the new more efficient units, at least a 10% to 15% premium over previous generation products. In Europe, where we are the leader in commercial heat pumps, Q2 and Q3 heat pump orders were up 30%, and we anticipate the same magnitude for the full year. And the TCC acquisition enables us to accelerate product development in the heat pump segment and become a more significant player in the fast-growing Asia VRF heat pump market. We also continue to benefit from the shift to electrification in our truck trailer business with strong traction on our innovative vector equal units. Customers now operate these units in 11 countries, and our market leadership in this segment is being recognized. Just recently, vector equal earned the top Product of the Year Award from the Environment and Energy Leader Awards program. In addition to sustainability, we continue to lean into the opportunity presented by the increased focus on health and wellness. We are proud to partner with our friend, Russell Wilson as we work with large-scale customers to provide them with safe and healthy indoor environments. Demand for our innovative solution continues to build. In Q3, healthy building orders were up over 55% compared to last year, and our pipeline increased to about $900 million. Within the K-12 vertical, Q3 orders were up 20% and we are up about 35% year-to-date. Our intense focus on digitalization goal for many reasons, but at its core, we are transitioning carrier from an equipment-centric provider to a solutions company with more aftermarket and recurring revenues. The opportunity to use digital offerings to embed ourselves in our customers' ecosystem to help them achieve specific outcomes is tremendous. Our Abound and link digital platform sends and collect data and interact with key building and cold chain system technologies to provide customers with the outcomes they desire. Abound not only provides healthy and sustainable solutions, we have also introduced new applications, including Abound predictive insights that reduce the total cost of asset ownership by enabling smarter, more predictive maintenance to optimize equipment health and performance. My leadership team and I are interacting directly with scale customers, and I can tell you that their willingness to make long-term commitments to Carrier is encouraging. Recent Abound wins include a nationwide drugstore chain that will add an additional 2,500 stores to our growing portfolio of managed multisite retail locations and an installation of more than 100 commercial office buildings for a key scale customer. Our efforts here are being recognized as the Abound EcoEnergy has received 5 awards in 2022 for innovation, impact and customer service excellence and its ability to deliver positive outcomes. Growing Abound sales will generate higher margin, more predictable recurring revenues and a stronger pull for additional equipment sales and services. And the same holds true for Lynx and our cold chain initiatives. We continue to add capabilities to our Lynx platform focused on providing our customers with greater flexibility, visibility and intelligence across the cold chain. Our advanced refer equipment insights and analytic models provide early and automated detection of refrigerant loss, enabling our customers to improve their asset uptime and operational performance and to protect the invaluable refrigerated cargo. In our North American truck trailer business, Q3 saw a more than 60%, 60% year-over-year increase in service revenues driven by thousands of new Lynx subscriptions. We remain on track for 100,000 new Lynx subscriptions by year-end. Our traction on solution selling driving more recurring revenues is reflected in our continued aftermarket performance, as you can see on Slide 5. Aftermarket was up double digits organically in the third quarter, and we continue to expect to realize over $7 billion in revenue by 2026. Connected devices are a fundamental enabler. We remain on track for about 20,000 connected chillers, our attachment rate was 40% in the third quarter, and we expect to have 70,000 chillers under BluEdge contracts by year-end. We are also expanding our parts sales enabled by our Breeze platform where we onboarded two new national accounts. Our aftermarket playbook is deeply embedded in our DNA, and we are seeing the results quarter-over-quarter. Lastly, on Slide 6. We continue to be confident in our ability to drive shareholder value even in the face of economic uncertainty by staying true to our proven strategy. We have consistently exceeded our expectations, and we will utilize that same playbook in 2023 and beyond, driving strong and recurring growth through differentiated solutions that address secular trends and increased aftermarket opportunities, eliminating waste and driving tenacious cost reduction and remaining disciplined in our capital allocation to accelerate growth and return capital to shareholders. As we close out Q4 and look ahead to 2023, we will control the controllables by doubling down on this proven playbook. I am deeply confident in the Carrier's team ability to drive continued strong results despite challenges that may be thrown our way. With that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7. Reported sales of $5.5 billion were up 2% compared to last year, and organic sales were up 8%, driven by price, with volumes flat. The Chubb divestiture reduced sales by 10% and acquisitions, substantially all Toshiba Carrier increased sales by 8%. Currency translation was a larger-than-expected headwind of 4%. All the segments were price/cost positive in the quarter. Q3 adjusted operating margin was down 40 basis points compared to last year. The margin impact of the Chubb divestiture and the TCC acquisition at about 70 basis points each offset each other. Price cost, although positive in the quarter, is a margin headwind of about 30 basis points. The adjusted effective tax rate of 23% is in line with what we now project our ongoing annual effective tax rate to be given the Toshiba acquisition. Adjusted EPS of $0.70 was stronger than expected and includes a $0.02 benefit from Toshiba, which will reverse in Q4, in essence, timing of integration expenses. For your reference, we have a year-over-year Q3 adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix on Slide 17. Free cash flow in the quarter was $699 million. While there has been some improvement in the supply chain, component shortages continue to affect deliveries and shipments and thus, inventory levels. Before I move on to the segments, let me make a comment about the other income you see in our P&L. As a result of the Toshiba Carrier acquisition, we recorded a onetime gain of about $730 million in Q3, which, in essence, is the step-up associated with the ownership stake we already had in Toshiba Carrier. This is not a taxable event. We exclude this onetime gain and amortization related to acquired intangibles from adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS. Moving on to the segments, starting on Slide 8. HVAC reported sales were up 22% and of course, reflect the impact of Toshiba, which added 12 points of year-over-year growth. HVAC organic sales were up 13%, driven by high single-digit growth in residential and strong double-digit growth in our light commercial and commercial HVAC businesses. Resi movement was down mid-single digits in the third quarter, and quarter-end field inventory levels are up about 20% year-over-year. We continue to work towards balanced year-over-year field inventory levels by year-end as we transition to the new 2023 products. Residential HVAC growth was all driven by price as volume was down mid-single digits. Our light commercial business grew over 20% in Q3 and field inventories remained down about 10% year-over-year. Commercial HVAC had a very strong quarter with double-digit growth in applied equipment, aftermarket and controls. All regions grew mid-teens. Sales in China were up more than 50% as we recovered from the impact of the Q2 Shanghai lockdowns. Adjusted operating profit for the HVAC segment was up 6% compared to last year. As expected, operating margin was down 260 basis points with about 150 basis point impact from the Toshiba consolidation and 90 basis points due to price cost. The balance is unfavorable mix and lower JV income, offset by good productivity. We expect the HVAC segment to remain price cost positive for the full year and to deliver full year margins of about 15%, consistent with what I shared with you last quarter. The Toshiba acquisition has about a 100 basis point dilutive impact on full year 2022 margins for this segment. Transitioning to refrigeration on Slide 9. Q3 reported sales include a significant headwind from currency translation as this segment is very global. Organic sales were down slightly, given significant supply chain constraints as truck trailer growth offset declines in container and commercial refrigeration. With transport refrigeration or within transport refrigeration, North America truck trailer saw strong growth in the quarter, up high teens. However, supply chain issues affected Europe truck trailer leading to increased backlog and inventories. Container sales were down about 20% year-over-year based on demand softness as well as tough comps. Sensitech delivered another strong quarter with double-digit sales growth.  Commercial refrigeration was flat year-over-year as our European food retail customers are pressured by high inflation and energy prices. Adjusted operating margins were up 80 bps compared to last year despite lower sales with favorable productivity, price cost and currency translation more than offsetting the volume headwind. The segment remains on track to deliver margins of about 12.5% this year. Moving on to Fire and Security on Slide 10. Excluding Chubb sales from the third quarter of 2021, Fire and Security segment sales were up 6%. Adjusted operating margins expanded 220 basis points in the quarter mainly because of the Chubb divestiture and productivity, which more than offset the impact of negative volume. This segment is particularly impacted by supply chain challenges, especially in the higher-margin access solutions business. Price cost was positive and this segment remains on track to deliver margins of about 16% this year. Slide 11 provides more details on orders performance. The total company organic orders were up low single digits for the quarter, and backlog remained strong throughout all segments. Similar to last quarter and as expected, resi HVAC orders were down in Q3 as the business continues to prioritize their order book and normalize the backlog that is still measured in months, versus typically weeks. Light commercial demand remained robust and orders were up almost 50% in the quarter. Backlog is up 3.5x year-over-year within that business, which should position us for a good start to 2023. And as I mentioned, commercial HVAC saw double-digit orders growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. All regions within commercial HVAC saw double-digit growth and the commercial backlog, excluding NORESCO, is now up over 35% compared to last year and extends well into 2023.  Refrigeration orders were up mid- to high single digits in the quarter, driven by an almost tripling of orders in North America truck trailer as we opened the order book for the first half of 2023 in September. Given how we manage the order book, a better year-over-year comparison for North America truck trailer is properly looking at year-to-date order performance. Through 9 months, orders are up 27% year-over-year for North America truck trailer. The transport refrigeration backlog remains up almost 10% year-over-year as the North America strength more than offset some order weakness within the Europe truck trailer business and container. Commercial refrigerated orders were down over 20% organically as the European food retail customers are impacted by energy prices and inflation. And as we continue to focus on improving profitability of this business. Finally, demand for our Fire and Security products remained healthy. Orders were positive in each of the businesses, except for access solutions, which has been most impacted by supply chain challenges. Fire and Security products backlog is up almost 40% year-over-year with double-digit growth in all businesses except residential fire in the Americas. As you can see on both the left and right side of the slide, we saw strong demand in many of our businesses. However, we have seen some weakness in a few areas such as in Europe, driven by Europe truck trailer and commercial refrigeration. In addition, the weaker container orders impact Asia, excluding China, given that this business mainly books orders in Singapore. For reference, with the addition of TCC, China sales are about 9% of our total company business. Now moving on to guidance on Slide 12. Compared to our prior guidance, we are reducing our full year expected sales by about $400 million with most of the reduction due to currency translation, the balance due to slightly lower organic sales growth. Accordingly, we now expect full year revenues of about $20.4 billion versus the prior guide of $20.8 billion. We now expect adjusted operating margin of 14.2%, up 60 basis points compared to last year and up 20 basis points compared to our prior guide. This reflects improved Q3 margin performance. Currency translation is also a minor tailwind to margins compared to our July guidance. We are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to the high end of our prior guidance or $2.30 to $2.35. This is primarily due to the strong performance in the third quarter including productivity that more than offsets the incremental earnings headwind from slightly lower volumes and currency translation. We continue to expect the TCC acquisition to have a neutral impact on adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS in 2022 with operating profit contribution to be mostly offset by the loss of equity income and integration expenses. However, as I mentioned earlier, the timing of the planned integration costs shifted from Q3 to Q4 causing a TCC adjusted EPS contribution in Q3, but a negative impact in Q4. Lastly, on free cash flow. Last quarter, we said achieving our free cash flow target has become more challenging given continued supply chain headwinds. While we did see supply chain improvements in Q3, the improvements are coming later than expected, and so it will not be enough to reduce our inventories by year-end to get to $1.65 billion of free cash flow. In addition, and to a lesser extent, free cash flow is negatively impacted as we acquired cash from the acquisition of TCC rather than receiving that cash through dividends from equity investments. As a result, we now expect to generate closer to $1.4 billion in free cash flow. This still includes approximately $200 million in tax payments related to the Chubb gain and a $100 million unfavorable impact from the expiration of the R&D tax credits. In summary, another good -- another quarter of good performance enables us to increase our adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS guidance. The strength we see in parts of our portfolio are helping to balance weakness in other areas such as Europe and some consumer-related end markets. Supply chain improvements are coming later in the year than we expected and are leading to elevated inventory levels impacting free cash flow. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for Slide 13. David Gitlin : Thanks, Patrick. We have delivered very solid performance year-to-date and remain confident in our ability to close out another strong year. Demand for our innovative products remains healthy, and I'm excited for the opportunities that we have in front of us. With that, we'll open this up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeffrey Sprague : Dave, now that Toshiba is completely in the wheelhouse, I just wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on kind of the forward look into kind of '23 and what you think you can do with the margins there and kind of what the restructuring plan looks like? David Gitlin : Sure. Well, let me start, and then Patrick can add some color. I would say that as we've looked under the covers at Toshiba, we're even more encouraged by what we see in the opportunity. I think one slight disappointment was price cost. I think we should have reacted. The company should have reacted a little bit earlier in the year to some of the cost headwinds that we were seeing. So when we closed on the deal, we did have to come in and raise prices. But we are also -- as we said, we were going to be aggressive on the cost side. We talked about $100 million of run rate synergies. And I can tell you there's opportunity on top of that. The team is going to drive that extremely aggressively. And I think the most exciting thing, as you look at the integration of the businesses, the VRF business is fundamentally a heat pump business. It's going to help us with our growth, not only in Asia, but in also in Europe. So really differentiated products. The integration with the team has gone extremely well. And I think in terms of margins, if you fast forward out five years or so, I think you're looking at an EBIT ROS that's in the mid-teens. Jeffrey Sprague : And just on the resi side of the equation. I assume it's kind of in your guidance, but it sounds like we should be expecting some absorption pressure in Q4 as you work down inventories. But also just curious maybe the apparent mismatch between backlog being very extended, but maybe inventories being seasonally higher than you'd like. Is that backlog now really kind of the new SEER stuff and we should think about that being delivered in 2023? David Gitlin : Yes. I think that our -- we've been watching that this very tricky balance between movement, inventory levels and the cutover quite carefully. Movement was down kind of mid-single digits in the quarter. Our key objective working very, very carefully with our channel partners is to make sure that we end this year with inventory imbalance. That's something that's very important to our channel partners and to us and I'm confident that we will. The cutover to the new SEER units has actually gone extremely well. And as you know, Jeff, we took a much more aggressive approach to drive more value add into the product. So we're now 100% cutover to the new product in the south. We'll be 100% cutover to the new products here as we get in about a month from now for the north. So that cutover is going very well. almost all of the new product will be shipped next year, and that's at about a 10% to 15% price premium. So I think we're trying to manage that inventory balance, and we're still sitting on around 4 months of backlog when usually we'd have 4 weeks. So we're carefully monitoring the fluid situation, but we feel confident where we are right now. Patrick Goris : Jeff, on the absorption, yes, there is a little bit of a headwind there. And I'd say that extends to some of the other segments as well. We just want to make sure that we exit the year with appropriate levels of inventory. So in some of our facilities, we'll take a little bit more downtime than we expected just a couple of months ago. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Let's talk about residential. So we're seeing some pretty divergent trends between heat pumps and AC units, and I'm guessing that will continue into '23, '24 and beyond. Some of your competitors have weaker positions in heat pumps. So you've got a very strong position. So I'm just wondering, are you seeing any share -- shifts as this dynamic plays out? David Gitlin : Yes. I would say, Nigel, that if you look over the last 12 months, I think it's clear we picked up, I don't know, 30 or so bps of share. So I think that our position in heat pumps has helped that. And I do think that on the flip side, we are working again with our channel partners to manage their inventory levels as they head into next year. I think at a high level, when you look at overall resi for the first -- for the third quarter, we had good price. We're sitting on backlog. We're managing the cutover. We're watching movement in field inventories. But we do get, as you know, and I'm answering kind of more broadly, Nigel than your heat pump question, but we get a lot of questions about resi overall. And just a bit of a reminder for folks is that some perspective, it's, say, 20%, 25% of our sales. And I think the thing, as we look at next year that will be most acutely under pressure will be the residential new construction piece. That's a quarter of the residential business. So that means it's about 5% of our total business, which means that if that residential new construction piece, just pick a number, was down 10%, that would impact our top line by 0.5%. And then you have these countervailing things like what you're bringing up, which is we have a number of positive mix stories, which is the shift to heat pumps. It's whether it's cooling only to heat pumps where we're doing particularly well, especially because we have outside share in Florida in places in the South. We have the new SEER units coming in. And then we also have, depending on how the inflation reduction act plays out, you have the heat pump mix from entry level to higher efficiency. So we are watching some of the concerns around volume overall, but there are some I guess, encouraging counterforces that should position us well as we go into next year. Nigel Coe : And then, Patrick, you mentioned some absorption issues as you looked at inventory in the channel. Just -- but when we take a step back and think about the new 15 SEER units going into the South, is there a learning curve to think about for those units as well? I mean, obviously, you manufacture 15 SEER for a long time, but as you put the new incentive, is there a learning curve impact there as well? Patrick Goris : We started selling them in, I believe, it was July, Nigel. So I think, yes, we worked on this we've worked on this for a long period of time, and we're there. So I don't see that at all as a headwind to our performance in our facilities. Maybe a couple of questions or a couple of points to the question you had about heat pumps. We believe we are the number one in U.S. resi heat pumps. As we mentioned, sales up 30% year-over-year in the quarter. really well positioned there. We believe we're number one in Europe, commercial HVAC each pumps. We mentioned there up 30% in the quarter. And then, of course, with the TCC acquisition, we even further strengthened our heat pump position that we can benefit from not only in Asia, but also in Europe with the residential opportunity over there. Operator : And our next question will come from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Maybe I just wanted to start off with the assumptions for the Q4 organic sales growth. So I think you're assuming sort of mid- to high single-digit organic growth in the fourth quarter company-wide. And then within that, are we assuming that sort of HVAC is up high single. Is that the right way to think about it? And then are you embedding resi volumes get worse year-on-year in HVAC in Q4. Patrick Goris : Yes. Nigel -- sorry, Julian Patrick here. You're right. For Q4, we expect organic growth to be high single digits. A little bit down from what we reported in Q3 for our organic growth. In terms of volumes, versus price in Q4. Again, we expect volume to be about flattish. So most of the organic sales growth driven by price. And actually, we do expect to have some volume growth in HVAC in the fourth quarter of the year, very modest. Julian Mitchell : And that HVAC slight volume growth, are we thinking sort of very strong commercial and then resi volumes down mid-single, similar to Q3? Patrick Goris : Generally, we would expect to have seen continued growth in commercial, in light commercial 2 businesses that are doing really well with strong backlog. We would expect again to have volume within resi to be flat to slightly down. Julian Mitchell : And then just switching back to Europe for a second. We saw the orders down in EMEA about 10%. They've been down in the second quarter as well. So how are you seeing kind of the broad demand environment there? It looks like refrigeration, in particular, is being hit hard, maybe something idiosyncratic to that market. Just any broad perspectives on kind of how you see the pace of that Europe slowdown playing out? David Gitlin : Yes, Julian, it's kind of a mixed bag for us in Europe. And first, I just mentioned for context, it's about 20% of our total sales. You'll recall when we had Chubb and before Toshiba was closer to 27%. So our exposure to Europe is down from what it was a year ago. Having said that, we have been pleased with the orders in key parts of our business. Commercial HVAC, fire and security have done quite well on orders in Europe. The things we watch, as you said, is really on the refrigeration side in both European truck trailer and CCR. The European truck trailer, I think that -- our sense is, as of right now, our lead times have increased a bit because of supply chain. So our customers are pretty well booked for the coming months. So we're not as concerned right now about the orders trends because of the significant backlog as we look out some months on ETT. But of course, that's something we have to keep an eye on. Clearly, the CCR piece is down. Some of our customers there are surely affected by some of the energy prices. So that was down in part because of the market, I think, in part because we are going to great lengths to improve our margins. So there's probably a bit of a mix in there, but Too early to say that's a trend, but there are a couple of watch areas for sure there. Operator : And our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Can we start with the healthy building orders up 55%. That's pretty impressive. And frankly, we've been waiting for this type of surge post-COVID. Was there a particular driver here where you saw these orders come through? Is there any of the government funding, adding a boost? But any color would be helpful. David Gitlin : Well, Dean, K-12 is clearly helping. And I think there's going to be impetus for them to continue to pick up the rate of spend in K-12. So orders year-to-date in K-12 up 35%. And I'll tell you a chunk of that has to do with this drive for healthy buildings. We now sit on a pipeline of $900 million, it's up 40%. But we signed -- I can't mention the name of the customer, but we have a customer in particular that's a really respected key scale technology customer [Audio Gap] that is encouraging people to come back to the office. And as they do that, they have 100 office buildings that are going to be putting Abound in part, they want to use it to give their employees confidence as they come back to the office around the indoor air quality. They're going to put the monitors in the lobbies. We're going to work to try to make it mobile accessibility. So you can see the healthy indoor air quality metrics on your phone. We're working with them on that. So we're starting to see more and more demand. We had a nice win in China. It was about a $5 million win. We had an exhibition center there that had new air handling units where there's a big focus in China. ALC, our controls business has done well. They had a key win in Georgia with a lot of IAQ solutions. So honestly, Dean, I think it's a trend that's here to stay. Deane Dray : And then a follow-up question on the chiller attachment rate of 40%. What's your expectations? Is that -- you would expect, given the kind of payback that attachment rate would be higher at this stage, maybe it's still early. But what are the reasons that customers are not giving you that order at the time of sale? David Gitlin : Well, what I would say -- by the way, just to clarify, it's not necessarily up 40%. It's at 40% . Deane Dray : At 40%. David Gitlin : Yes, yes, I'm sorry. But look, we said that we were going to improve our attachment rate by percentage points a year, and that would put us at year-end in the low 40s. And I just think we continue to drive the playbook, where when it comes off warranty, we are there to get a long-term agreement. And we continue to see traction as we add salespeople in the right cities, in the right locations with the right digitally enabled offering. So we're pleased with the progress. We take a very strict interpretation of what we call an attachment rate because if we look at -- after we sell a chiller, do we get predictable sales, that's 100% of the time. If that's what the definition is that we want to use, it's 100% because we always get parts sales, we always get service to it. We always get a certain amount of sales. We want a long-term agreement that's sticky, that's recurring revenues, and that's the definition we use, and that under the BluEdge paybook is growing 5 percentage points a year. And the other one we really look at is total chillers under some form of LTA, and that's growing 10,000 chillers a year, and that will be 7,000 by year-end. Operator : And our next question will come from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Can we start on price cost? It looks like it was positive across each of the segments. Just any potential quantification on how positive it was for the quarter? And then as you're thinking about the carryover effect into 2023, maybe just provide some color on that as well. Patrick Goris : Yes, Joe. The price growth impact to margins in the quarter was unfavorable 30 basis points. But from a dollar perspective, it was a favorable thing, give or take, about $50 million in Q3 alone. With respect to carryover based on prices that we have already implemented, we would expect carryover next year to be several hundred million dollars. At the same time, I'll have to say though that we would also expect some carryover inflation next year, especially inflation related to purchases where we have material pricing formulas. There is a little bit of a lag there. So the net impact to the P&L, the price cost called for next year will be lower than just a few hundred million dollars of good news. Of course, we continue to target price cost neutral at worst. And I'll also say that for next year, of course, what we're looking forward to is a potential good impact from commodity cost tailwinds. Joe Ritchie : And then maybe just kind of my next question, really focusing on the strength that you're seeing on the commercial HVAC market. obviously, double-digit orders now for 7 quarters in a row. There's a lot of concern that like commercial is going to follow resi into a downturn. So Dave, I'd love to just kind of hear your thoughts on that and what your expectations would be as we kind of head into 2023 as well? David Gitlin : Well, let me tell you what we're seeing, Joe, is that you mentioned the 7 quarters of double-digit orders growth. And the nice thing is that it's across the globe. North American was up something like 20%. China was up double digits. Asia-Pacific outside of China was up close to 20%. Europe was up double digits. So it's pretty broad-based. Certain verticals do better than others, but K-12, health care, data centers, some of the industrial areas, especially even in China, where we pivoted from property to industrial, very purposefully there. They continue to be quite positive. So we're quite well booked for next year in commercial HVAC, where our backlog is up 30% year-over-year. Healthy buildings is strong, as we said, the shift to sustainability and the focus there is strong. So -- and the other thing I would mention is that ABI, as you know, Joe, is a nice leading indicator. And that's been above 50% now for 20 months straight, toggles between 52%, 53%, 54%, but for it to be above 50% for 20 months in a row, is encouraging. And then we have a lot of investments around Abound that's going to create a lot of pull for long-term sticky revenues, but also some of our products. So I would tell you on see HVAC and of course, the same is true for light commercial encouraging trends. Operator : Our next question will come from Josh pkrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Gustavo Gonzalez : This is actually Gustavo Gonzalez on for Josh. Just sort of looking at the various pieces of stimulus into next year. How are you sort of thinking about that? And how much do you think that sort of adds to sort of the demand pipeline or even addressable market for 2023? David Gitlin : Well, there's a couple of things at play. I would say three things. You have the Inflation Reduction Act you have the infrastructure bill. And then you have what's happening in K-12. If we start with K-12, the ESR funds, they've only spent very little of the $190 billion that's been allocated towards the school. So I do expect as strong as our orders have been that spending continue to pick up, which, of course, regardless of economic cycles, government-funded spending on K-12 should withstand whatever happens in the broader economy. So that's encouraging. On the Inflation Reduction Act, the big thing that will play out over the next couple of months is whether the $2,000 a year incentive applies to both the kind of the mid-tier SEER units as well as sort of the higher-end SEER. If that happens, I think you're going to see a very broad-based upgrading from your entry-level heat pumps to that mid-tier heat pumps, which would be obviously good for the planet, good for our customers' energy bills and frankly, good for us as well. And then just the broader Infrastructure Act has provided some tailwind as well. And then we see similar things happening in Europe. So I think regulation and incentives is very thematic for us. That does help during different economic cycles. Operator : Our next question will come from Tommy Moll from Stephens Bank. Your line is open. Tommy Moll : So as part of your value creation framework, you've talked about using productivity to fund some investments. And I wondered if you could bring us in on what the planning could look like there for a potential recession scenario. So just to the extent that volumes were pressured in a potential recession, how much more difficult is it to realize some of those productivity objectives? And are there different buckets of investments that would be highest priority not willing to sacrifice versus more discretionary or relatively lower priority that could potentially get pushed out if necessary? Just some of the push and pull there would be helpful for your planning. Patrick Goris : Yes, Tommy. So let me start by talking about productivity for this year. We started out by saying that we would target $300 million in productivity, and that remains our target for the year. And frankly, we're on a path to achieve that for the full year. Now in case of a potential recession, a couple of things. One is -- we continue to have tremendous opportunity to take cost out of our system, whether it's our factory footprint, whether this is from a sourcing point of view, we still have way too many vendors that we intend to consolidate over time or G&A opportunity. In addition, I will say that what we've been struggling with the last year or 1.5 years is tremendous inefficiencies in our factories, shortages of parts, causing inefficient manufacturing operations, expedited freight, logistics, wherever we look, we probably have significant pockets where we are less efficient now than we were two years ago or maybe even three years ago. So if there would be a downturn, not only would we expect to continue to go after cost that we see today, we would expect to get back to much higher levels of efficiency in some of our facilities. And then, of course, what we have not talked about, which is the whole price/cost equation. We expect -- we -- of course, we see important input costs come down. We don't see a significant impact on this year just because of our hedged or our lock positions. But clearly, in an environment where we might see a revenue decline. We would expect commodity input costs to further go down, and we would expect to benefit from that as we've been very clear that we would have no intention of giving up price. Tommy Moll : I wanted to pivot to the repurchase authorization that you announced. I think it was another $2 billion that the Board approved and your cash flow guidance was reduced, but you're still expecting a pretty significant haul for this year, especially in the back half. So how should we think about the cadence of repurchases, the level of priority there? Any change to what you've communicated before or more steady as she goes? Patrick Goris : The way you can think about it, Tommy, is from a capital deployment priority point of view, very clear and no change. Funding organic growth in organic, for example, what we've done with TCC, a growing and sustainable dividend and then share repurchases. You mentioned $1.4 billion of free cash this year, so we're counting on a big last quarter of the year that is not unheard of. And as of today, we have $3 billion in cash. And all in, we expect to end the year with about $3.3 billion in cash. In terms of the new authorization. So in addition to the -- what's remaining of the prior authorization, we have about $2.3 billion left for share repurchases. Think about that authorization taking us through all of 2023 and into 2024. And the way we're thinking about this, obviously, is depending on opportunities for M&A or what the share price does or, of course, the general macro outlook, we'll either lean in more or we'll pull back a little bit. We have plenty of flexibility there. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Just on the kind of the market call for next year, so you mentioned new housing being down and I guess you didn't really touch on David Gitlin : I didn't. What I said, Steve, is that if I gave [Indiscernible] Steve Tusa : Yes. Got it. Yes. So that's kind of like looks pretty likely given what we're seeing in the data, right? But you didn't say that, True. What should David Gitlin : No. you've been saying that for a while. Steve Tusa : Well, I think new housing is the obvious one. It's the debate is really around the replacement market. What's kind of the feedback you're hearing from the channel on how people feel about the replacement side of that market for next year? What's kind of the latest and greatest there? David Gitlin : I would say it's early to say. We're -- as you know, we're coming off some really strong years there. So it's something that we're going to have to watch because there's just a lot of moving parts in the system. You have these 3 different mix changes that are playing out, the mix of the higher sear, the mix from cooling only to heat pumps, the mix from potentially entry-level heat pumps to the higher efficiency one. And then you have all those underlying trends that we've seen that in some respects, continue to go into '23, like people working from home and in some cases, mixing up. Will there be some volume pressures on the replacement market potentially on the volume side, but there's a lot of things that whether you put it in price or mix are a tailwind. So it's a bit -- it's a bit early to say exactly what's going to happen on the volume side for the replacement side. Steve Tusa : And then just on like commercial, it looks like Lynx bounced back a little bit in their production, but we're hearing the train is now having materially extended lead times. Where is -- I assume you guys feel like you're taking market share there. And is are we right that there's still some choppiness in that supply chain, perhaps or others? You guys look like you're kind of scaling through that unlike commercial. David Gitlin : Yes, I would tell you that we've all had our challenges. I don't want to pretend that we've been challenged for you. And you saw that kind of in the second quarter I would say that we have seen material progress. When we're seeing orders up 50%, we're seeing sales up 25%, which we saw in the third quarter. We're very, very well positioned there. I think if you look over a 12-, 24-month period, I think folks would agree that we've taken share. And we continue I think the benefit from not only some operational performance, but we've introduced a new product that is 40% more efficient than the one that it replaced. So I think new product a little bit of continuous improvement on the operations side. It puts us in a position for like commercial, Steve, where our backlog is at record levels. Patrick said it in the script, but our backlog is up 3.5x versus the third quarter of last year. So that does position us well, obviously, for 4Q, but as we head into next year. Steve Tusa : Sorry, one last quick one. Just on this -- the transport refrigeration stuff. All in, what's kind of the latest and greatest view on that? Obviously, the orders are very strong in North America, but there's perhaps some timing around opening up those order books. Europe looks a little weaker. What's the ACT has it up next year, but they cut their number, some stuff moving around there? What's the latest on your market view for that one into next year, globally? David Gitlin : It's a --Yes, it's fluid, as you just said, Steve. I mean, containers definitely a watch item. I mean the container piece of the business that we are dealing with really tough comps because last year was a record year. And this year, we did see -- we expected it but Q3 was down something like 20%. So container, we continue to watch. We've gotten some recent orders, but it's something that we do have to watch. NATT was up strong, high teens. And as Patrick said in his script, we can't really look at the strong orders in the third quarter. We have to look at it kind of year-to-date, where I think it was up in European truck/trailer, you look at that and the orders were down, but I mentioned the very strong backlog position. So it's a little bit early to say, but we know there's broader economic concerns in Europe. So too early to say there. And I think a real positive helping transport is this shift to link in our Sensitech business doing quite well. So the good news is global truck trailer, our backlog is up 15% year-over-year. I saw the same stuff you just mentioned with ACT taking down some of their numbers for next year, but it would still would be positive over this year for NATT, and we're sitting on good backlog. So a bit early to say, but it's something that we are sitting on a strong backlog. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna : Wanted to just follow up on your comments on resi next year. It sounds like the volume decline or increase or whatever is uncertain, but can you talk a little bit quantitatively about price cost, if you kind of snap the line on commodities today and where your hedge positions are, where you think some of the other components may shake out in terms of inflation year-to-year? So what kind of -- what's the size of that opportunity next year? And then if you could just talk about pricing and what informs your confidence that pricing will hold if, in fact, industry volumes are down mid- to high single digits, pick a number? David Gitlin : Well, let me start with the latter and then turn it over to Patrick for the former. Look, I would say for resi, but more broadly for Carrier. I think one of the big targets that we have for ourselves for next year is to maintain the pricing and we're going to have to keep an eye on commodities, but that should be copper, steel and aluminum that should be coming down for next year. So it's a little bit too early to say, but that might be -- that spread could be a positive story for us as we go into next year, not only for resi, but more globally. Patrick mentioned that we have some Tier 1 carryover cost increases that we have to contend with from some of our suppliers. And then our job through Carrier Alliance is to manage those suppliers, and we'll either have suppliers that support us on our journey or they don't. And those that don't, we're going to have to deal with aggressively. And those that do will lean into and give them more business. So that's our job in terms of execution. But commodities, I think, will certainly be down next year, and we have to maintain price. But in the middle of all of that is you're going to get a mix up from a number of these changes that we're not only seeing in resi, but you're also seeing, as you look at things like the shift to electrification in our transport business as well. Patrick, do you want to hit the first part of Gautam's questions? Patrick Goris : Yes. We touched a little bit on that on the potential tailwind from the commodity. But as Dave said, it's significant. It's too early for us to quantify. David Gitlin : Okay. Well, listen, I just want to close by saying thanks to all of you on the call, and thanks to the Carrier team. If you look at things over the last couple of years, this team has gone through the same kind of macro challenges all of our peers have gone through with COVID supply chain challenges. But I can tell you through a person that our 55,000 people come in every day determined to be best in class in everything we do and we're seeing it in our results. And I know there's certain folks have anxiety as they look at '23. We have optimism because of this great team. So thank you, everyone. And of course, Sam is available. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Samuel Pearlstein : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call; which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com.  The company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Our Q4 results for sales, earnings and cash flow were all in line with our expectations, as you can see starting on Slide 2.  We delivered organic sales growth of 5%, supported by another quarter of double-digit growth in light commercial and commercial HVAC, global truck and trailer and aftermarket. Pricing remained strong and our realization continued to offset inflationary headwinds. Supply chain improvements continued, allowing for a reduction of our past due shipments with further improvements anticipated in 2023. Our backlog, which ended up mid-single digits year-over-year, up 40% on a two-year stack and up 2x from 2019 remains at very healthy levels. Adjusted operating margins of 10.1% were flattish compared to last year, despite a 70-basis point impact from the consolidation of the Toshiba joint venture. We made great progress on our productivity initiatives in the quarter and achieved our full year target of $300 million in savings. Adjusted EPS was $0.40 in the quarter at the high end of our guidance range. We generated about $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter ending 2022 with $3.5 billion of cash, allowing us to continue to play offense with capital deployment as we head into 2023. Moving to Slide 3. I am proud of our team's accomplishments last year. We delivered on our full year outlook for sales, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS while significantly advancing our strategic priorities. We drove 8% organic sales growth, adjusted operating margin expansion of 60 basis points and adjusted EPS growth of about 15%, when we exclude the impact of the Chubb divestiture. Though we did fall short of our original $1.65 billion free cash flow guide, we discussed in October, resulting from supply chain and related inventory challenges we did deliver on our revised guidance of $1.4 billion as a result of our strong Q4 performance.  So, our track record of delivering results without surprises continues, and our team is poised to continue to deliver in 2023, in part because of key secular trends that drive demand, as you can see on Slide 4. Our customers continue to look to us for healthy and sustainable solutions, and we have differentiated offerings that meet their needs, particularly in the fast-growing heat pump space. Our North America residential heat pump sales grew 35% in the quarter to a European commercial heat pump sales were up 30%.  We expect those areas to only grow stronger as the inflation Reduction Act and the RePower EU initiative propel increased adoption. Additionally, Toshiba's innovative and leading inverter technology continues to impress. When combined with our multi rotary compressors, heat pump efficiency and capacity dramatically improve. Toshiba's technology and expertise are also helping us penetrate the attractive and growing residential heat pump market in Europe. Our position in transport electrification is also market-leading. We have units operating in 15 countries and plan to ramp significantly with more than half of refrigerated transport units sold to be electric by 2030. The healthy building trends continued to be a positive in the quarter as orders were up over 80% and our pipeline increased to over $1 billion. For the full year, healthy building orders were up about 50%. K-12 also remains encouraging with our pipeline up about 60% year-over-year, and with almost two-thirds of the federal government's ESR funds yet to be allocated, we expect further acceleration into 2023. As we continue to distinguish ourselves as a climate systems and solutions company, we remain focused not only on achieving our own ESG goals, but also helping our customers achieve theirs as well. We recently increased our previous aggressive 2030 net-zero targets, committing to set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with the science-based target initiative criteria. Additionally, Carrier continues to be recognized in the ESG space, including distinguished recognition in London, where our customers' heating network will provide a 50% reduction in carbon emissions to network participants. We also continued to perform on our aftermarket growth objectives, as you can see on Slide 5. When we became a stand-alone public company in early 2020, we emphasize increasing aftermarket growth rates from historical low single-digit levels. And last year, we produced another year of double-digit aftermarket growth.  Our focus remains on providing differentiated digital solutions through our Abound and Lynx platforms and connecting not only our new products, but also our significant installed base. Our Abound technology now monitors over 1 billion square feet, and we recently onboarded over 100 commercial office sites for a key large-scale customer. We recently released the Abound Net Zero management, which provides customers with an easy way to view, track and analyze energy usage and emissions data across their global footprint and proactively identify conservation measures. We've made similar progress with our innovative Lynx platform and launched several new capabilities in the quarter. We expanded our reefer health capabilities to include early refrigerant leak detection, and launched a managed services linked fleet offering for a major grocery retail chain in the U.S. We achieved our goal of having 70,000 chillers under long-term agreements by the end of 2022 and expect to increase that by another 10,000 in 2023. Importantly, we also achieved our objective of having 20,000 connected chillers and plan to connect another 10,000 this year.  We recently announced a strategic collaboration agreement with Amazon Web Services, to jointly build, market and sell Carrier's digital solutions. Not only are we delivering on our financial and strategic imperatives, we are also making great progress on our portfolio optimization and executing on our capital deployment priorities as you can see on Slide 6.  You'll recall that at the time of our spin, we carried approximately $11 billion of debt on our balance sheet and cash of about $1 billion.  Over the course of just 2.5 years, we have reduced our net debt levels nearly in half from that $10 billion level to $5.3 billion while increasing our strategic organic growth investments by over $300 million. We have also completed a number of compelling acquisitions highlighted by the consolidation of Toshiba Carrier. All acquisitions have been strategic and core to our business focused on enhancing sustainability leadership, accelerating aftermarket growth, driving digital and technology differentiation and expanding adjacencies and geographic coverage. We've also been disciplined in evaluating our existing portfolio to ensure each business is core and that we are the best owner. As a result, we optimized our portfolio by completing the sale of Chubb and our shares -- completing the sale of Chubb and our shares in Bayer while also reducing our minority joint venture count from 41 to 29 since spin. In addition to our portfolio moves, we've been disciplined and proactive with our other capital deployment actions. We have steadily and consistently increased our dividend and have completed about $2 billion in share repurchases since spin.  All of this to say, we have made great progress over the last few years, but that does not mean that we are done. We are always evaluating acquisitions in our current portfolio for potential opportunities for simplification and value creation. We will remain steadfast in our commitment to keep evaluating our portfolio as we enter 2023 and beyond. Patrick will cover our 2023 guidance in more detail, but I will emphasize a few highlights on Slide 7. Focus remains very thematic for us. All of our 52,000 team members are aligned on our key priorities, and those priorities remain consistent.  Carrier 2.0 is a term that we have been using internally, which represents a very purposeful shift from a primary focus on selling equipment to now using digital and innovation to provide our customers with sustainable and healthy outcomes throughout the life cycle of our product and service offerings. The result will be our continued pursuit of higher margin, high aftermarket growth rates. We remain focused on reducing costs and expect to get another $300 million in productivity in 2023. We are clear-eyed about the broader economic challenges and uncertainty in 2023 and have done our best to calibrate macro factors in our guidance that you see along the left of this slide. We expect to deliver solid organic growth, strong margin expansion, excluding TCC and high single-digit to low double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Strong free cash flow and a very healthy balance sheet enable us to play offense on capital deployment. With that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8. In short, Q4 was very much in line with our expectations and the guide we provided.  Reported sales were $5.1 billion, with 5% organic sales growth driven by about 8% price with volume down a couple of points. I'll provide a bit more detail on a future slide, but in essence, we saw continued strong organic growth in HVAC, Fire & Security and global truck and trailer, which was partially offset by a very weak quarter in container and to a lesser extent, commercial refrigeration. The Chubb divestiture reduced sales by 10% in acquisitions, substantially all Toshiba Carrier increased sales by 8%. Currency translation was a headwind of 4%. All segments were price/cost positive or neutral in the quarter. Q4 adjusted operating margin was about flat compared to last year, driven by a 70-bps margin headwind related to the TCC acquisition. Strong productivity almost completely offset the margin headwinds related to the lower volume and the TCC acquisition. Adjusted EPS of $0.40 was consistent with the upper end of our full year guidance range. For your reference, we have included the year-over-year Q4 adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix on Slide 20. $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter was also as expected, and we generated about $1.4 billion for the full year. Moving on to the segments, starting on Slide 9. HVAC reported sales included a 16% benefit from the TCC acquisition. HVAC organic sales were up 9%, driven by low single-digit growth in residential, over 40% growth in light commercial and mid-teens growth in commercial HVAC. Sales growth was driven by both price and volume. Residential movement was down about 10% in the fourth quarter and quarter end field inventory levels ended up higher than the flat year-over-year levels we targeted. Residential HVAC growth was driven by price as volume was down mid-single digits. Commercial HVAC had another very strong quarter with double-digit sales growth in applied equipment, aftermarket and controls. All regions grew double digits. Adjusted operating margin was up 60 bps with volume, price/cost and productivity more than offsetting a 100 bps margin headwind related to TCC. Full year operating margin for this segment was 15.2%, in line with the guide we provided post the TCC acquisition, which had about a 70 bps dilutive impact on 2022 for this segment. Transitioning to refrigeration on Slide 10. Organic sales were down 7% and currency translation was also a 7% headwind. Within transport refrigeration, North America Truck/Trailer sales were up low teens and European Truck/Trailer was up high teens. This continued strong performance was more than offset container, which was down about 50% year-over-year driven by demand softness as well as a tough comp in the prior year. This is the second competitive down quarter for the container business and historical down cycles for this business have lasted about four quarters. Commercial refrigeration was down high single digits year-over-year, as our European food retail customers continue to be pressured by inflation and energy prices. Adjusted operating margins for this segment were up 60 bps compared to last year despite lower sales with the margin headwind of lower volume, more than offset by productivity and price cost.  Full year operating margin of 12.8% was slightly ahead of our 12.5% guide and expanded over 70 bps compared to 2021, despite lower sales as our refrigeration team managed price costs and delivered strong full year productivity to offset the impact of lower volume. Moving on to Fire & Security on Slide 11. As expected, the Chubb divestiture had a significant impact on reported sales. Organic sales growth was 6%, driven by price with volume down low single digits. Operating margin was short of our expectations for this segment due to continued high supply chain and logistics costs and operational performance challenges. As a result, full year operating margin of 15.2% for this segment was short of our 16% operating margin guide. Slide 12 provides more details on backlog and orders performance. As our backlogs normalize in some of our shorter-cycle businesses, such as residential HVAC, we expect order trends to adjust accordingly. We have seen that trend over the last few quarters and in Q4, particularly. As you can see on the left side, total company organic orders were down roughly 10% for the quarter and up compared to 2019 and 2020.  Backlog ended the year up mid-single digits compared to last year, with backlog growth in HVAC and Fire & Security, partially offset by backlog reduction in refrigeration. As expected, Residential HVAC orders were down in Q4. Light commercial demand remains robust as orders were up mid-teens in the quarter. The backlog is up well over 2x for that business. Commercial HVAC saw double-digit orders growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. The commercial backlog is now up 35% compared to last year and extends well into 2023. Refrigeration orders were down roughly 10% in the quarter, driven by market weakness in container and commercial refrigeration that was only partially offset by Global Truck and Trailer. North America Truck and Trailer continued to have strong orders in the quarter, up over 100% compared to last year. Global Truck and Trailer backlog is up high single digits as the strength in North America offset order weakness in Europe. Container orders were down about 50% compared to a very strong fourth quarter last year. Commercial refrigeration orders remain weak and reflect market softness. Finally, demand for our fire & Security products was mix. Orders were positive in roughly half of the businesses, including residential fire and access solutions. Fire & Security Products backlog is up almost 30% year-over-year with double-digit growth in all the businesses, except residential fire in the Americas. Overall, we entered 2023 with strong backlogs and continued strong order trends in commercial and light commercial HVAC and North American Truck and Trailer. Businesses experiencing softer order intake include container, commercial refrigerating and residential HVAC. Now moving on to our '23 guidance on Slide 13. We expect reported sales of about $22 billion, including organic sales growth of low to mid-single digits. Almost all the organic growth will be priced as we expect volume growth to be flattish. We expect currency translation to be about one-point headwind on while acquisitions, primarily the impact of Toshiba Carrier will contribute about 6% to the growth. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up compared to 2022 with operating margin at about 14%, including a 50 bps dilutive impact from Toshiba Carrier. We expect high single-digit to low double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2023. I'll provide more color on that on the next slide. We expect a 23% adjusted effective tax rate and full year free cash flow of about $1.9 billion or about 100% of net income. Our free cash flow guidance assumes approximately $75 million of cash restructuring payments and about $100 million tax headwind, since Congress has not renewed the full expensing of R&D.  As shown on the right side of the slide, we expect mid-single-digit organic growth in HVAC as continued strong growth in light commercial, commercial HVAC and aftermarket are more than offset flat residential. Reported HVAC sales growth should be in the low teens -- in the low double digits, given the additional contribution from seven more months of consolidating Toshiba Carrier. In Refrigeration, we expect flattish organic sales as continued strong growth in Global Truck and Trailer is offset by container and commercial refrigeration. For Fire & Security, we expect low single-digit organic growth.  We expect the HVAC segment operating margin to be similar in 2022 despite absorbing about 100 bps of pressure from the consolidation of Toshiba, and expect operating margin expansion in Refrigeration and Fire & Security. Let's move to Slide 14, adjusted 2023 EPS bridge at our guidance midpoint. Our operating profit is expected to be up about $200 million, despite flattish volume growth. Price cost and gross productivity combined or an expected operating profit tailwind of $500 million, with $200 million coming from price cost and $300 million coming from gross productivity.  Annual merit adjustments and investments amounts to about $200 million in total, and we expect about a $50 million additional headwind of TCC integration costs. There are some other minor smaller moving pieces, but that all adds up to roughly $200 million in increased adjusted operating profit. Core earnings conversion, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FX is about 35% at the guidance midpoint. Moving to the right on the bridge, some modest savings on net interest expense and a lower share count offset the expected higher tax rate and currency translation headwinds. That gets us to our midpoint of about $255 million for next year or 9% growth compared to 2022. As usual, we provide estimates of other items in the appendix on Slide 19. On Slide 15, you'll see that our capital allocation priorities remain the same. In 2023, we expect about $400 million in capital expenditures. We recently announced another significant dividend increase and our dividend payout ratio is about 30%. Finally, we target $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases in 2023. Before I turn it over to Dave, let me provide some additional color on the first quarter. We expect a $0.06 headwind from a higher effective tax rate of about 25% compared to 16% last year. In addition, we expect our first quarter to be the weakest quarter from an organic revenue growth perspective with organic sales growth flat and volumes down. This reflects continued growth in the HVAC and Fire & Security segments and a decline in the Refrigeration segment driven by container and commercial refrigeration. We expect residential HVAC to be down mid-single digits in Q1. Recall that our Q1 '22 residential HVAC sales were up an industry-leading 23%, so certainly a tough comp for that business. Overall, we expect revenues in Q1 to be a little over $5 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $0.45, $0.50. We expect first half adjusted EPS to be about $0.45 to $0.50 of full year earnings, the reverse of 2022. And as usual, free cash flow will be more weighted to the second half. We expect organic revenue growth to sequentially improve after Q1 with easier comps in the second half of 2023. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for Slide 16. David Gitlin : Thanks, Patrick. We delivered strong performance in 2022, and we are targeting another strong year this year as we continue to execute and control the controllables. We continue to see opportunities to use our strong balance sheet to create value for our customers, shareholders and the planet for future generations to come. With that, we'll open this up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to start with maybe start with the first quarter outlook there. So it sounds as if you've got maybe the operating margins firm-wide down perhaps sort of 200 to 300 points or so year-on-year. Just wanted to check if that's the case. And is the bulk of that downdraft really coming in HVAC presumably? And if it is, kind of what's the confidence that you can get back to full year margins in HVAC being flattish given the headwinds in resi for the year? Patrick Goris : Julian, good morning. Patrick here. The margins in Q1, we expect them to be down about 200 basis points, and there really three elements to it : One, acquisitions, and that is HVAC specific, expected to add over $500 million of revenue, but with very little operating profit contribution. Two, volume mix, as I mentioned, is expected to be down in the first quarter. That's not -- that is really not just in residential HVAC, but is also impacting, of course, the refrigeration segment.  That's the secondary contribution to the 200 bps or so margin contraction in Q1. The third element is price cost. We expect price cost to be close to neutral in Q1, which actually is a headwind to margin -- margins in the first quarter. And that is across the three segments. So that gets to about a 200 bps margin contraction in the first quarter. In the second quarter, we would expect to return to year-over-year EPS growth. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And maybe just following up, on the HVAC segment overall for the year. So I think you talked about a flattish margins there that sort of 15% plus in that business, and you've got organic sales guided up about mid-single digit for the year. Maybe just clarify for us what you're expecting there on your residential volumes, perhaps within that guide? And then any sort of weighting on things like the productivity savings, just trying to understand where you get the offset in that HVAC margin, if there's a mix headwind and a TCC margin headwind as well? David Gitlin : Well, Julian, let me start with a little bit of color on kind of resi and what we're seeing across the mix between resi, light commercial and commercial, and then Patrick can give a little bit of color on the margins themselves. We do expect for resi in 2023. We're expecting flat sales, flattish sales, but we get there with volume being down potentially high single digits, offset by mix and price. So when you think about resi, we're looking at new construction potentially down 20%, 25%. Now remember, that's only about 20%, 25% of resi, but some of our customers are saying it could be much better than that, some were saying it's in that range.  So we'll have to see as we get into the second half of the year, but we've calibrated residential new construction down 20%, 25% and replacement down mid-single digits. We are seeing that offset that gets us the flattish sales for the year driven by mix and price. So we have some price carryover. We've just announced a new price increase of 6% that's effective in March. We're going to mix up this year, as you know, because of the new SEER units that are coming in and we are pricing 10% to 15% higher, and we're also seeing a mix up as we transition to heat pumps.  Also in the mix is that we do see a strong year for light commercial, which was, as Patrick said, up 40% in the fourth quarter, that continues to be very strong. And our backlogs in commercial with a nice mix with aftermarket of double digits, controls up double digits, helping that piece. Patrick, maybe comment on the full year. Patrick Goris : Yes. On the margins, Julian, we're comfortable with the margin outlook for HVAC in 2023 of about 15%. Dave mentioned about aftermarket. But I did also mention that price cost is expected to be a tailwind for us of $200 million in the year. That dials in some benefits from what we call deflation. A lot of that sits in the HVAC segment.  In addition, I mentioned that we're focused on delivering another $300 million of productivity in 2023. We did the same in '22. And of course, given the size of the HVAC segment, a sizable size, of course, is in that segment as well. So we're comfortable with those 15% margins for the full year. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment please for our next question. And our next question coming from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. So can we touch on that price cost neutral comment in 1Q? I guess that's a little surprising to me, just given that price was probably -- there's probably a good carryover effect occurring from 2022. And then from a cost perspective, I'm just wondering, is there like higher cost inventory that's coming through? Is it a function of like the merit increases being more front-end loaded? Just any more color you can provide on that price cost neutral in 1Q would be helpful. Patrick Goris : Yes. The short of it is, and it's mostly in HVAC is the first quarter of 2022, we were left in at some really attractive pricing from a steel point of view, and the year-over-year impact is actually a net negative for us. As I mentioned to Julian just earlier, we are dialing in a benefit from deflation that kicks in the second quarter of 2023. In Q1, we still have a headwind, particularly in steel that affects HVAC. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful, Patrick. And then I guess I'm just going to stick on margins and just want to understand some of the operational challenges that you guys faced in the fire and security business this quarter. And then also, as I kind of think about the 2023 guidance, it doesn't seem to imply that much margin growth in the segment. So just maybe just kind of talk us through what some of the issues are and how those are supposed to rectify in 2023? Patrick Goris : Yes. If I look at the margin performance in Fire & Security, it was up year-over-year in the fourth quarter by 60 basis points. And the way you can think about it is the absence of Chubb is a tailwind to margins. Volume mix and price/cost was a slight headwind to margins. The net was still a margin expansion of 60 basis points. The margins were lower than what we expected. One, supply input costs and higher supply chain costs than what we expected; two, inventories not aligned with where the business is today. And that has some operational impacts, which we experienced in the fourth quarter of the year.  And so we have to work through that. And that is what we expect for 2023. And therefore, we expect with minimal volume growth in \u201923 to have margin expansion in Fire & Security. The revenue growth we expect in Fire & Security in '23 is mostly price driven, less volume driven. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Dave and Patrick, that color you gave on resi, obviously, encompasses what's going on with field inventories. But maybe you could elaborate a little bit more on how inventories ended versus your expectation? And how you think they kind of normalize over the balance of the year? David Gitlin : Yes, Jeff, we had a target of getting field inventories at the end of last year, flat to where they ended '21. And they were actually a bit higher than we had targeted, not excessively higher, but just I would say, a bit higher. And we do think that there will be destocking as we go through the year. Obviously, when you're in the first quarter, there's some level of stocking that happens in anticipation of the season.  So we think the destock happens throughout the year. When we -- we actually -- it's kind of interesting. When we talk to our channel partners, there are still significant demand out there. There's what happened in Florida where we have some of our homebuilders continuously pushing on us for more products. So we have a bit of a mix taking place where there's demand for the new product. Obviously, everything in the South that we're shipping is the new product, and we started that early.  They're starting to ramp in the north to get the new SEER units. There's still demand from some of our key homebuilder customers, but we do recognize that there is some still destocking that's going to take place through the course of the year. So we'll have to see how the year plays out. You know that this business can swing based on a variety of factors, relatively quickly. So we think we've been conservative in how we've handicapped the year, and then we'll have to see how these next couple of quarters play out. Jeffrey Sprague : And then can you just elaborate a little bit more on what you're expecting on TCC. We get kind of the arithmetic of the headwind on margins as it comes into the fold. But in terms of your internal improvement plan there, Dave, moving margins up over time and what kind of actions you're taking to drive that? David Gitlin : Yes. I will tell you, we were in Japan and very pleased with the progress that safe and the team are making on TCC. We've said that we expect margins -- EBIT ROS margins to be in the mid-teens as we get out five years after the acquisition. We are certainly on track for that. We had said $100 million of synergies. I have a lot of confidence we're going to beat that number. And if you look -- if you kind of get rid of all the noise of getting -- eliminating the minority income that we were picking up and the integration costs. Right now, you're in the low teens. That's just a stand-alone business. So, that team is making a lot of progress. Technology, best-in-class. We talked about the rotary technology, the inverter technology. We're using that technology to penetrate the attractive residential heating space in Europe. There could be applications in North America, our prospects in China with TCC look extremely strong despite some of the macro uncertainty in China.  Japan, we've had to come in aggressive on pricing rightfully so, and we've been doing that. And there's a lot of cost takeout opportunities, especially in supply chain, where we see the team really aggressive supply chain synergies between the two companies. So very pleased so far. Patrick Goris : And by aggressive pricing in Japan, we see increases. David Gitlin : Yes, aggressive. I mean, yes, good point. Yes. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning everyone. So it looks -- it looks like low to mid-single-digit contribution from pricing. So would that be what 3%? So the gross pricing of maybe $600 million for the full year. Is that in the right down? I'm just curious how much do you think comes -- is coming from carryforward from 2022 actions versus contribution from some of these price increases you're layering in, in the first half of this year? Patrick Goris : Nigel, the ballpark number you have there, it's in the ballpark, $500 million, $600 million of carryover in pricing. Most of that -- in total pricing, most of that is carryover. We have some new price increases that we've announced as well. We've dialed of course, some of that in, and we're looking at additional price increases as well. David Gitlin : I'd add, Nigel, it's fluid. We came into the year. And over the last few weeks, we've announced new price increases that we feel that were appropriate. Resi announced a 6% price increase. For North America, light commercial and North American commercial, we're looking at up to 8% recent price increase. We're going to raise prices in both North American Truck Trailer, European Truck Trailer is probably in the low to mid-single-digit range.  So -- we watch inflation trends. We watch our elasticity curves, but we do think it's appropriate that we are going to need continued price increases certainly in the first half of this year. Nigel Coe : And normally, if you announce a price increase of 6%, you capture maybe 2% when we need net of normal promotions and I made some discounts and volume discounts. That hasn't been the case in the last couple of years. But I'm just curious what sort of capture rate do you expect going forward? But maybe if you could just also break down as well how you see the Refrigeration segment in 2023? There's a lot of moving parts there. Just curious with the ease comps you've seen in the back half of the year in both commercial and transport, how you see the full year playing out within that segment? David Gitlin : Yes. Let me start on pricing realization, a little bit of color on refrigeration, then Patrick will add to the phasing of the year. Look, our realization rate on pricing was very high last year, as you know. We came into the year thinking that we'd get $1 billion of price. And when all was said and done last year, the number was closer to $1.6 billion. So we've seen very high realization rates in pricing. And we would expect that to continue as we go into '23.  On Refrigeration, I'll tell you at a high level, you're looking at a bit of a mix bag. North American Truck Trailer has been very strong. We saw order rates in Q4 over 100%, and that's still without opening the order book effectively for the second half of this year, and they were up 40% for the full year last year.  European Truck Trailer has -- we've calibrated that business, we think, well, they performed extremely well last year. I think the thing that we're tracking in the refrigeration business is the container business, which we know was light. Patrick mentioned you're usually looking at about a four quarter cycle. We're coming off two of down sales. We expect another couple. So we expect to see that start to improve as we get in the second half of this year.  And commercial refrigeration was a bit light, but there will be pent-up demand for commercial refrigeration. Some of the supermarket chains in Europe have been squeezing their budgets. They can't do that forever. So, we do think that as we go through the year, we start to expect to see commercial refrigeration come back. And I'll tell you, I know that both us and our key peer who we have a huge amount of respect for are both claiming that we've gained a lot of share in Truck Trailer. So mathematically, that can't -- we both can't be right. But I will tell you that when we look at its customer by customer, we look at our order rates, I could tell you with huge confidence that we've gained chair in Truck Trailer in Europe and in the United States and globally. So, we feel very good about that business, and we feel good about the snapback as we get into the second half as we start to see the recovery in container and our commercial refrigeration business. Patrick Goris : And Nigel, couple of comments on refrigeration. Think of Q1 organic sales being down mid to high single digits, Q2 down mid-single digits and then basically returning to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year. And that is all related to what Dave, just mentioned earlier about container. Four quarters that we assume to be down, two more to go. Same with commercial refrigeration, and we see continued strong performance in particularly North America Truck and Trailer. And so that is how we've dialed in the plan for refrigeration, which we expect to be flattish from a full year perspective on an organic sales basis. Nigel Coe : Thank you, very much. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning guys. Dave has covered a lot of ground on the productivity -- I'm sorry, on the demand front. Maybe just shifting over to productivity. I know you don't really talk about like Carrier 700 or whatever kind of iteration we're on these days as much now since the last Analyst Day and you kind of have this price/cost productivity formula. Just wondering how versus that $100 million net a year, you would think about it for this year? And kind of the totality of the pipeline in front of you? Do you feel like you've gotten through a lot of the opportunities since the initial separation? What's still left to go? David Gitlin : We have a huge ways to go, Josh. We -- what happened is we came out of the gate, we had good productivity than we saw over the last year, a lot of the supply chain headwinds that were fairly unexpected that really hurt a lot of industries. So now as we're starting to come out of that, I think we see significant opportunity.  What Patrick said effectively was $300 million of productivity plus 200 of price/cost positive for a total of five between those two. When we look at it, we think logistics is a big opportunity for us this year. We're starting to see rates come back to more traditional levels for containers coming from Shanghai to L.A. We see global logistics. We paid a lot in high logistics costs, in spot price for electronics, our spot price for electronics are significantly down month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter. We expect that to continue. We think there's a great opportunity with our Tier 1 suppliers. We had been very aggressive on Carrier Alliance, and then we really had to slow some of that activity because our focus became getting parts to feed the lines in the shops. And now we got to get back into our focus on having partners that we can rely on for the long term that share our desire for joint growth.  So we look at it. We see opportunities for productivity in the factories. Continued takeout of G&A. You'll recall that we used to be 9.5% as a percent of sales. We got down to 7% at the end of last year. More transfers of work to low-cost places like Europe going to Eastern Europe. And all things direct material, which is a big percentage of our direct buy. So we got away from calling a Carrier 700. We said 2% to 3% productivity forever. And we think we're in early phases of what are significant opportunities for cost takeout. Patrick Goris : And Josh, our guidance is very much aligned with what we shared at Investor Day, $300 million of gross productivity, offset by about $200 million of investments in merit and a net $100 million falling through the bottom line. That's in our guidance. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. I appreciate that net number, Patrick. And then just shifting gears over to some of the stimulus out there. How do you guys think about some of the opportunities for IRA, whether residential or commercial this year? David Gitlin : Well, we look at the IRA, still kind of going through final comments. We see that getting fully implemented towards the middle of the year, but the opportunity there is very significant. You have the 25C tax credits, which can provide a homeowner up to $3,200, really looking at $2,000 for a heat pump. And what was really significant there was -- they made that in the current drafting, especially in the key parts in the South, that's eligible for the two stage heat pumps, which means that it really provides a meaningful incentive for a customer not only to shift from cooling only to heat pumps, but also to a two stage heat pump, which could be significant.  It used to be that 30% of our split sales for heat pump, we\u2019re now at 35%. We're seeing our growth rates continue to start with [indiscernible] And you're seeing the same 30% -- 35% in North America, 30% for commercial heat pumps in Europe.  So we think that the Inflation Reduction Act will be meaningful, both in residential, but also for commercial. They doubled in that 179D [ph] they doubled the commercial building tax credit up to $2.50 to $5 per square foot for energy efficiency systems. So we think that will be meaningful as well. And then there's a whole significant amount of incentives as you get into Europe. Europe effectively dodged the bullet because of the warm winter that it had this past winter, but the supplies are not going to be what they need as they head into the winter of 2023. And that's going to drive significant demand for heat pumps in both residential, which is a space that's very attractive that we're looking to continue to penetrate. And commercial heat pumps, we're number one in Europe. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho Group. Your line is now open. Brett Linzey : Good morning, all. Let me come back to the Refrigeration segment. I appreciate all the sales detail there. I was hoping you might be able to put a finer point on the profitability of that weaker container and commercial refrigeration. I imagine that profit profile is much lower. But any way to frame that or provide some context would be great? Patrick Goris : The container business is a really attractive business within refrigeration. Our enormous installed base also enables us to go after significant aftermarket given the 1 million-plus units that are out there that we're trying to connect and drive aftermarket revenue. Commercial refrigeration today has lower operating margins, and so they're below 10%.  They're probably close to 5% in to 10%. But we've taken out a lot of costs. And so as we focus on productivity irrespective of volume growth, once volume starts to turn, we expect there to be attractive incremental in commercial refrigeration. So underlying profitability from an operating margin significantly lower than the overall average of the segment. But once volumes kick back in, given the work that we have done, we would expect to see attractive incrementals there. Brett Linzey : Got it. Thanks. And then just shifting over to the gross productivity. You noted the $300 million. Patrick, you said $50 million to offset Toshiba. What are the balance of those investment priorities? And then are those signed and sealed for 2023? Or is there an opportunity to flex those up and down as needed? David Gitlin : Look, our priorities really center around our shift to Carrier 2.0, which is really around aftermarket enabling technologies, digital capabilities. So we have been very purposeful in our plan setting to make sure that we have plenty of investment set aside for a bound for Lynx for connecting our devices out in the field. That's been our priority. And then all things technical differentiation when it comes to more energy-efficient chillers and more energy-efficient products, electrification in both heat pumps and in our truck trailer business. So as we do our waterline process, there are some investments that we consider sacred because it's either part of our conscious strategic shift or because of differentiation for key product lines. Brett Linzey : Its ok, great. I\u2019ll pass it on, thanks. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Maybe we could start with Patrick. Strong finish to the year on free cash flow, hitting expectations on the provided guidance. kind of take us through the dynamics, especially on working capital. It sounded like you ended up with higher inventory. Where do you stand on like buffer inventory with supply chain issues? And how does that impact the outlook for '23 on free cash flow? Patrick Goris : Well, we expect $1.9 billion in 2023 for free cash flow, which actually does include a tailwind from reduced inventories. And so, we know we ended the year inventories than we intended in the beginning of the year. Frankly, it's the main reason why we missed our $1.65 billion target for the year.  So, we ended the year, I think it's fair to say with a few hundred million dollars of more inventory than we expected. I would not call all of that buffer inventory. Some of that, frankly, is related to the length of the supply chain and the lead times that are still not coming back to what we are used to. And so we're assuming that we'll see some continued improvement there in 2023, which will lead to about $100 million or so tailwind from lower inventories in '23 versus where we ended the year in '22. Deane Dray : That's real helpful. And then, Dave, you had an interesting comment earlier on a question referencing elasticity curves, and it seems like during COVID there -- everything was in elastic. You saw no demand destruction anywhere. But maybe it's an impact of normalization. There could be some more competitive pressures. But just kind of take us through some of your insights here on the elasticity curves and setting pricing, what the reactions are because -- I don't know, maybe we've lost some muscle memory about how that is just part of the economics here. David Gitlin : Yes. Look, we -- in our residential business, we went through something like six significant price increases in the span of 18 months. So I think that what we've seen over the last couple of years is an unusual pace of price increases that we've not only announced that we've also realized. We do think that as you head into '23 and to '24, you get back to more traditional levels.  But in the first half of the year, we've realized that inflation is not over. And we've had to announce further price increases in January that perhaps even a couple of months ago that we might not have anticipated because the inflationary pressures continue to be there. So it's not equal in all segments. We think we'll probably get less pricing in the container segment right now than we will in commercial, HVAC, light commercial, residential to some extent. Parts of our Fire & Security business, we probably across our brands have implemented over the last couple of weeks, 20 different price increases depending on the segment within Fire & Security and the brand.  So we'll watch it, but we've -- in the first half of the year, we believe that the inflationary pressures are still there, and we need to price accordingly. Deane Dray : It will helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Good morning. Can you just talk about like the trend of what you see on Transport refrigeration orders as well as light commercial orders? Those have been very strong. I know the light commercial market is up nicely, but obviously, some very big numbers in the context of 50-week lead times in that industry. Just curious as to how you see that trending because there could be some perhaps unusual activity in that market in particular. But maybe how you see those orders trending over the next several quarters here? David Gitlin : Yes. I'll start, Steve, with light commercial. Light commercial has just been extremely strong. We saw orders were up in the mid-teens in the fourth quarter. If you look at overall 2022, orders were up 45% And demand is still strong for things like K-12, value retail, fast casual and quick serve restaurants. So -- all trends seem extremely positive. The issue we have continues to be with light commercial keeping up demand, where we're implementing second-line second shift. And our focus is in our customers. The issue we have right now as far as the I can see, is not a demand one in light commercial. On the Transport side, orders were up extremely strong in the fourth quarter in North America, even with us trying to control opening the order book for the second half of '23. North American orders were up 2x, North American Truck Trailer. Europe Truck Trailer was down a bit.  I would say mid- to high single digits, I believe. We have, of course, seen orders very light in the container space, which is why we've calibrated that business down, certainly in the first half of the year. But -- what's really encouraging is the North American Truck Trailer piece, the demand remaining very robust there. Steve Tusa : And then just one follow-up on the resi side. So you ended the year with inventories just a bit above what you expected in the channel. Like how do you -- what signals are you looking for here for like demand this year. How confident are you in your distributors' projections to make the assumptions you're making? I mean, how wide is the band of outcomes there, in your view, given the situation with inventory? It just seems to me that like everybody is throwing out kind of flat to down.  But when you kind of ask for the underlying, they talk about what happened in the fourth quarter, maybe what happened in January. And anything that's informing your view and maybe a little bit of a ring fence around the band of outcomes there on volume? David Gitlin : Well, it's a good question, Steve. Yes, we try to calibrate it what I would say conservatively, now we'll have to see when all is said and done, if it turned out to be conservative, but we put volumes down high single digits for the year with -- when we looked at it, we said new home construction down 20%, 25%. I -- we have a couple of customers in particular that on their earnings call said that they expect to get to flattish for the year. So will the industry be down 20% to 25%, perhaps we have outside share in the industry. So in many respects, we should go the way of the industry. But there's a wide range of outcomes there where could it be flat? Could it be down 30%? Who knows anywhere in that. But again, that's 20%, 25% of our residential business, the new home construction. And then on the market, you've been around this longer than I have, but that can swing very significantly in a short cycle business because it's fundamentally a replacement business. And a few hot weeks in the summer, you're going to see demand really pick up significantly. So we think we calibrated volume correctly there, but we'll have to see how the rest of the first half plays out. Again, tough comps in the first quarter. But even just yesterday, we were doing a review of the resi and demand is -- continues to be there from many of our key customers and some of our issues are just continuing to keep up with that demand. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. Thanks a lot for the color, appreciate. Operator : And our last question in queue coming from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna : Good morning guys. Can you tell us how far out your booking -- according Truck Trailer orders? David Gitlin : Yes, second half of the year. So we looked at it. We're just now opening our order book for the second half of the year. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And was that in Q4 or now in Q1? David Gitlin : Now. I think we might have taken on discrete order for Q3 in Q4 for a specific reason. But basically, we only opened our order book now for the second half. Gautam Khanna : Okay. That's helpful. And I was wondering if you could talk about inflation in the supply chain this year on your Tier 2 components, so not commodities. But just in aggregate, what is the pressure you're facing from component suppliers and the like? David Gitlin : Well, I know they're not raw materials, but we do see -- on that piece, we should see some benefit. They've been swinging quite a bit. I know that's not the heart of your question, but we sort of block ourselves on the steel piece, which should be down from last year. Patrick mentioned, we had the hangover from really good pricing in the first quarter of last year on steel.  So as we get out of 1Q, we see the benefit of that. Copper and aluminum down from last year. We did see a bit of an increase recently, but we still expect year-over-year benefit. And then what we're going to see with our Tier one\u2019s is, you probably have two categories. You have some that have gotten a fair amount of inflation from us and our peers over the last 12 months that we'll continue to try to push inflation. Then you'll have some that are thinking for the long term and trying to build long-term relationships with us and that we won't get the level of inflation because they will look at trying to take volume from those that continue to push inflation.  So for those that really want to be on the journey with us for the long term, they will be the beneficiary volume that we will shift from those that are continuing to push inflation our way. So net-net, it is our job, and I think our opportunity to really start to make a very conscious shift of our supply chain partners. And we were on that path. We had to pause it a little bit because of some of the supply chain challenges we saw last year. But I can tell you for sure, we're going to get back on that path in a very aggressive way here as we go into '23. Gautam Khanna : And just last one, Dave. You talked about price and resi. I'm curious historically, and maybe what's your view on this cycle with respect to the minimum here? The 10% to 15%-point difference between the prior minimum. Do you think that holds or does that fade over time? I'm just curious like how sticky is that pricing on the minimums here? Thank you. David Gitlin : Sticky. Yes. We have very high confidence that, that 10% to 15% for the new units will be sticky. It's been sticky thus far. We think it will remain sticky as we go through '23 and beyond. And look, we've all taken slightly different approaches. We took the approach for the unit to do more redesign rather than less and look for more differentiation, and we've done that. We've driven more of a copper to aluminum shift. We've driven a microchannel heat exchanger. We've done a lot of aesthetic and fit and spacing and size. So we've done a lot to make that our new SEER unit, a very, very attractive and differentiated -- And one of the big things will be some of the control features as well. So we think that because of the value we're offering and because of what the customer is getting, we think the pricing will be sticky. Gautam Khanna : Thank you. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. David Gitlin : Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining. We're excited about how we closed last year and even more excited about '23. And with that, we'll close the call, and please reach out to Sam for any questions. Thank you all. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to Carrier's First Quarter 2023 Earnings and Strategic Update Conference Call. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, sir. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you and good morning and welcome to Carrier's conference call to discuss the transactions we announced last night along with first quarter 2023 earnings. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. There are two presentations available there, one for the strategic actions, and one for the first quarter 2023 results. The company reminds listeners that the sales earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Once the call is open for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and follow-up to give everyone the opportunity to participate. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Well, thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. A big day for us and we appreciate your flexibility joining us this morning on short notice. Today we are announcing a new Carrier, a new direction and an exciting transformation, a game-changing opportunity to acquire Europe's premier company in the most attractive market in our space, allowing us to capitalize on the energy transition in Europe. Combined with the planned exits that we are also announcing, Carrier will become a simpler, focused, pure-play leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions that generates higher growth and superior shareholder returns. Before we discuss this transformation in more detail, we will cover the highlights of our Q1 results on slide two. In short, good news, the team executed very well. We beat our forecast on the top line with 4% organic growth with double-digit growth in aftermarket controls commercial and light commercial HVAC and global truck trailer. Orders were modestly positive in the quarter with year-over-year orders performance improving as the year progressed. Adjusted EPS of $0.52 exceeded our projections and we generated significantly more free cash flow year-over-year. Based on our strong Q1 results, we now have confidence in the high end of our full year adjusted EPS guidance range. Before we discuss our exciting announcement about our future, let me take a brief look back on how far we've come already on slide three. I am so proud of our team's accomplishments since spin. In short, we do what we say we're going to do. Our commitments were to drive sustained growth, improved margins through rigorous cost reduction, increased aftermarket revenues, deliver strong free cash flow, innovate and ensure customer loyalty, energize our teams and culture and strengthen our portfolio and balance sheet. We have grown sales at an 8% CAGR since 2020. And since 2021, we have expanded margins by 150 basis points and have driven an adjusted EPS CAGR of 19%. We have effectively driven significant productivity, growing our aftermarket double digits annually and have introduced over 400 new products over the past three years. We launched important new platforms for our building and cold chain ecosystems Abound and Lynx, with both getting superb traction with our customers. We dramatically improved our portfolio, positioning ourselves in the fast-growing VRF market with the acquisition of Toshiba's HVAC business and Giwee, while completing the sale of Chubb and our bearer shares. We improved our balance sheet, reducing our net debt by 50% from $10 billion to $5 billion all while doing $2 billion of share buyback and increasing our dividend payout ratio from 17% in 2020 to a targeted 30% this year. This outstanding performance has been made possible by our world-class workforce and agile new stand-alone culture. As a result of all of that, Carrier stock price has appreciated 229% since our spin date compared to 66% appreciation for the S&P 500. So with our foundation firmly in place and a track record of execution, we are now announcing a purposeful shift in our strategy, which is what you see on slide four. We have a very clear and compelling vision, to be the world leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions. Strategically, we are positioning ourselves in the fastest-growing geographies, with highly differentiated channel access and the most comprehensive and differentiated suite of sustainable technology and services. Digitally enabled life cycle solutions will increase aftermarket and recurring revenues. Our energized team will continue to drive unparalleled customer loyalty and superior shareholder returns. This strategic shift in our vision has led us to the decision to further focus our portfolio and align it with faster-growing end markets, which leads to the announcement that we're making today on slide five. The first is the acquisition of Viessmann Group's Climate Solutions business, the premier company in the highest growth segment in the heat pump and energy transition markets. This will also expand our capabilities as a one-stop shop for renewable and climate management solutions. We are also announcing that we are initiating the process of exiting our fire and security and commercial refrigeration businesses. The former decision was easy, combining with the best asset in the best market could not be more compelling and exciting. The latter decision was tough. We love these businesses and our people in them. We have tremendous brands, gross margins, market positions and customer stickiness. But we saw the benefit of focus as we spun from UTC and we are confident that further focus will create additional tremendous value. The result will be a new Carrier, with higher revenue and EBITDA growth profiles, leading market positions globally with a portfolio unlike any other company in the world. So let me start with an overview of Viessmann Climate Solutions business on slide six. Viessmann Climate Solutions with 11,000 team members as part of the family-owned Viessmann Group, who have established market leadership over its 106-year-old history. The company has made a purposeful shift from fossil fuel boilers, such that now 70% of its portfolio consists of premier heat pumps, digitally enabled services, solar PV and battery offerings. It also has highly differentiated boiler business that includes state-of-the-art hydrogen-ready offerings. About 40% of its sales are in Germany, with very strong positions in France, Poland and Italy. Those four countries make up more than 50% of the heat pump installed base in Europe with 20% annual heat pump growth rates. The combination of Carrier and Viessmann's Climate Solutions creates a tremendous game-changing opportunity. And as a result, the Viessmann founding family is showing great confidence in the combined entity, taking 20% of the purchase price and equity which has been fixed at signing. And we look forward to Max Viessmann joining our Board of Directors. Furthermore, we are excited to welcome the tremendous Viessmann team to the Carrier family to help us realize our shared vision. Carrier and Viessmann share a very similar journey as you see on slide seven. A phrase that we have used a lot to describe Carrier is a 100-year-old startup. Interestingly, Viessmann is very much the same. Both companies had visionary founders, who largely created and shaped the markets that we're in and both of our businesses have evolved into agile, rapid innovation, climate-focused, digital industrial leaders. Together, we are establishing a new global climate champion and that is one of the many reasons why Viessmann Climate Solutions just fits like a glove, as you see on slide eight. Thanks to the generations that came before as a Carrier, we have established market-leading positions globally. But when we spun, we had two strategic gaps, BRF, which we have now addressed with the acquisitions of Toshiba and Giwee and European residential light commercial heating, which we are now addressing with the premier asset in the space. These transformative moves position Carrier with market-leading positions now globally. So as we look at slide nine, you see the three primary rationales for this tremendously exciting acquisition. First, it is the most attractive market in our space globally. Second, Viessmann Climate Solutions is the premier asset in that market. And third, it positions our portfolio to expand into integrated renewable offerings in a unique and differentiated way. So I'll address each of these three elements starting on slide 10, explaining why the market itself is so attractive. The megatrends that you see here are reshaping our industry. Climate change and sustainability, energy, security and the rapid adoption of green energy solutions accelerated by government, regulations and incentives. These secular trends are indeed global but are clearly most acute in Europe. Europe has long been out in front on sustainability. The Paris Agreement and the European Green deal set a target for a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Fit for 55, targeted 40% renewable energy in Europe by 2030, which was recently raised to 45%, when the EU passed REPowerEU following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. REPowerEU also aims to double the current rate of individual heat pumps to reach 10 million additional units over the next five years. Likewise, 17 European countries have announced or implemented bans on newly installed fossil fuel heating systems for homes, which has been supported by government subsidies. The result is the massive growth that you see on Slide 11. There are 8.5 million heat pumps in European homes, which is expected to increase 25% annually to 40 million by 2030. Residential battery sales are also projected to increase over 20% annually during this time frame with a double-digit annual increase in residential solar PV sales as well. Carrier does not offer solar PV and home battery solutions today. So Viessmann Climate Solutions offering provide Carrier the perfect opportunity to pursue an incremental fast-growing annual TAM of $35 billion. The shift to heat pumps is unique and compelling given the mix-up opportunity that you see on Slide 12. First is the rapid adoption of heat pumps, from selling about one million per year, going up to 10 million per year in 2030. Now factor in the positive mix impact with heat pump selling for as much as 4x per unit compared to boilers. The result of that combination is that the EU residential heat pump market is expected to grow revenues 25% annually for the coming years. The opportunity is tremendous. So turning to Slide 13. Let me provide some additional color on why Viessmann Climate Solutions is the premier company in this space. Thanks to Professor Dr. Martin Viessmann, who represents the third generation of the founding family and his courageous move 30 years ago. Viessmann Climate Solutions is one of the very few companies in Europe that primarily sells directly to installers. 75,000 of them, with whom they have deep, long-standing relationships. This highly differentiated channel allows for best-in-class customer intimacy, rapid innovation in response to the customer desires and digital connectivity. Likewise, the Viessmann brand is iconic and highly trusted across Europe. It has often been compared to as the Mercedes of residential heating brands. During German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's most recent New Year's address, he singled out Viessmann as a shining example of the innovative side of Germany. It has the highest ranked heating and energy brand in Germany and has been the most trusted OEM for almost two decades. The result, thousands of customers recognize and demand Viessmann climate solutions and are willing to pay a premium for it. Its excellent reputation is largely driven by its track record of product leadership and premier innovation as you see on Slide 14. Viessmann Climate Solutions has leaned in to the use of natural refrigerants and as heat pumps require 50% less floor space and installation time. They also developed a new integrated heating solution called Viessmann Invisible, a patented concept which optimizes space and aesthetics by integrating the heat pump, air handler, water tank and accessories into a decorative indoor panel. They are at the digital forefront providing innovative heating as a service offerings and generating subscription-based recurring revenues. The result, outside top and bottom line growth as you see on Slide 15. We expect approximately \u20ac700 million of EBITDA on \u20ac4 billion of sales in 2023. Fast forward to 2025, we expect those numbers to increase to over \u20ac900 million and \u20ac5 billion respectively. That's double-digit top and bottom line growth and it's nothing new for them. They've done it in the last few years and we expect it to continue going forward. So best asset in the best market. What's equally exciting is that the combination positions Carrier to enter an entirely new market, given that Viessmann Climate Solutions has effectively established and ecosystem approach as you see on Slide 16. Viessmann has done a masterful job of creating common and distinctive designs across its product portfolio, that all interact seamlessly with one another so the consumer becomes attached to its ecosystem with multiple interoperable products, digital and value-added services. Max Viessmann and his team have effectively implemented this strategy. Its solar PV battery, and heat pump systems can all be installed at different times, but are then seamlessly interconnected and interoperable, all underpinned by their common digital platform one base.  One base gives the customer an easy, reliable and quick way to operate their energy system via an app. The platform bundles devices and electronic applications, into one single climate and energy solution for the home. The beauty as you see on Slide 17, is that Viessmann Climate Solutions is the only company in the industry with such a comprehensive solution level offering. When you combine Viessmann Climate Solutions unique market position and breadth of offerings, with Carrier's technology and global channels, the opportunity for us to create unique value to our homeowner and other customers and importantly the planet is truly differentiated. Homeowners in Germany with boilers spend on average \u20ac2,200 per year, on gas heating. Switching to an electric key pump, can reduce the owner's cost by over 20% to \u20ac1,700 per year. If those same homeowners implemented a complete renewable solution, with solar PV, battery storage, heat pumps and an energy management solution with effective grid management and controls, they could -- annual heating bills by 60% to 80% to about \u20ac700 per year. Those same owners same homeowners would also reduce their individual carbon footprint by about 50%. So the world continues to be more electrified, integrated solutions provide a step change in customer value and benefit to our planet. This broad suite of offerings, introduces a new addressable market to Carrier, as you see on Slide 18. Heat pump sells for about 4x the price of a boiler. When you add solar PV, battery and accessories and services, the installed price can be as high as 15 to 20x the installed price of a stand-alone boiler. The result is Carrier's ability to now pursue a 35 billion fast-growing market opportunity. The key to success is effectively integrating and coming together as one team. We have done it so effectively before, and I have no doubt that we'll continue to do it again, as we see here on Slide 19. Viessmann Climate Solutions is a highly integrated successful well-run business. It has tremendous people, one ERP system, one brand, a deep well-established channel and a strong operations and innovation. We have been very impressed with Thomas Heim, Viessmann Climate Solutions CEO and his leadership team. Thomas will lead Carrier and Viessmann Climate Solutions, Center of Excellence for our combined residential and light commercial European business, which will continue to be headquartered in Allendorf, Germany. After completing the acquisition and business exits, the vast majority of our business will be HVAC. As a result, Chris Nelson and I have collaboratively agreed to streamline the organization. Our superb HVAC business leaders, will now report directly to me and Chris will be departing Carrier next month. He has served the company for 19 years, so well, and we wish him nothing but the best. Another reason for confidence in the integration is how well our cultures align as you see on Slide 20. A passion for customers and results, unwavering commitment to our people values and purpose, innovation, community and a deep passion for the environment. Together, we will achieve important and compelling sustainability targets. We are aligned and cannot wait to move forward together as one team. Our base business case, includes the cost synergies that you see on Slide 21. We have identified \u20ac200 million of cost synergies the vast majority of which will be achieved by year three and we have a track record of over achieving our projections. On Toshiba, we committed to 100 million of synergies and we are tracking to do meaningfully better than that. Viessmann Climate Solutions is a rapidly growing business, so this is not about employment reductions. Rather about 85% of the cost synergies are driven by procurement and in-sourcing. For example, we anticipate in-sourcing differentiated inverter drives from Toshiba, heat exchangers from our facilities in Spain and Poland as well as other components like rotary compressors and vents. Cost synergies are expected to increase Viessmann Climate Solutions margins by over 200 basis points within three years. There were also revenue synergy opportunities, which we have not included in our base estimates, such as introducing multi-tier offerings into Viessmann Climate Solutions channel and leveraging its digital ecosystem offerings and technologies more broadly across Carrier's channel. Now I will turn it over to Patrick to take you through the transaction itself on Slide 22. Patrick Goris : Thank you Dave. The enterprise value is \u20ac12 billion, which is about 13 times forecasted 2023 EBITDA assuming \u20ac200 million of run rate synergies. We are very pleased that the Viessmann founding family elected to take 20% of the transaction value in Carrier equity and that the family is making a long-term holding commitment. They share our excitement about the future -- the future value we believe this transaction will provide to our stakeholders. The number of shares are based on a VWAP prior to signing and are those fixed. The balance of the purchase price \u20ac9.6 billion will be funded through a combination of cash on hand and debt. With respect to cash we have $3.3 billion at the end of Q1 and we expect that to grow to about $4.5 billion by year-end excluding the impact of the acquisition since we paused share repurchases. We have fully committed financing in place for about \u20ac7 billion and have hedged the cash portion of the euro-based purchase price. Given Viessmann Climate Solutions growth profile, the acquisition is expected to add over 100 basis points to Carrier's overall revenue and EBITDA growth profile. We expect a high single-digit free cash flow yield starting in year five. While the acquisition is expected to be adjusted net income accretive in 2024, we expect the acquisition to be adjusted EPS accretive starting in 2025, because of the additional shares outstanding. Retaining solid investment-grade credit ratings is very important to us. Yesterday Moody's, S&P and Fitch have reaffirmed our current investment-grade ratings following the announcement of this transaction. Excluding proceeds from the business exits, we plan on deleveraging quickly following the transaction returning to about 2x net leverage in 2025 after which we expect to resume share repurchases. The timing and net proceeds of the business exits may of course accelerate the timing of both the deleveraging and the resumption of share repurchases. We expect to repurchase the equivalent number of shares issued to the Viessmann founding family as soon as we reach our target leverage. This could happen as soon as 2024. Finally, we remain committed to a sustainable and growing dividend and expect the transaction to close around the end of 2023. David Gitlin : Well, thank you Patrick. [Audio Gap] So the $1.1 billion business that we are exiting at high single-digit EBITDA margins last year, we have invested significantly in restructuring and improving the margins of the business, which will significantly benefit the business going forward. We expect to exit this business over the course of 2024. To be clear, we are retaining our cold chain solutions and transport refrigeration business which includes truck, trailer, container, Sensitech sensors and our Lynx platform and all the related aftermarket and digital offerings. So in summary on slide 25. These moves position us as a higher top and bottom line growth company. Had we made these transformational moves three years ago, Carrier's revenue CAGR would have been 2x the rate that we indeed achieved, mid-teens rather than 8%, thus giving us confidence that we are transforming into a sustained higher growth profile company. With Viessmann Climate Solutions, we are now positioning ourselves to be the Global Climate Solutions Champion. We are buying the premier asset in the premier market. We are standing by our commitment with our portfolio to be clinical and dispassionate and though we are selling tremendous franchises, the result will be a focused differentiated carrier that drives higher growth and returns for our shareholders and value for our employees and customers. And with that, we'll open this up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning and congratulations. David Gitlin : Thanks, Julian. Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a first question around Viessmann itself. So, a couple of things. One was maybe if you could help us understand its market shares in the main businesses that you're most attracted to in it for example heat pumps. I think it's got close to maybe $1.5 billion $2 billion of sales and you talked about sort of a $5 billion TAM somewhere in the deck, but I'm not sure those are apples-to-apples. So maybe just help us understand the market share. And also, you talk about the appeal of it the uniqueness of the sort of one-stop shop aspect with the residential building. In the nonresidential world, the sort of the one-stop shop has been harder for equipment suppliers to get right. So maybe help us understand why in the residential world you're confident of that one-stop shop approach is the one that will drive share gains and returns? David Gitlin : Sure Julian. In terms of their positioning, what I'll tell you is that they are the number one premium brand across Europe. So in the premium market with heat pumps they're number one. Within Germany and heat pumps, they're number one. And across Europe, air-to-water heat pumps they are in the top five. In terms of the latter question, what they've done that is incredibly impressive is that they've designed -- you can think of it almost as the apple of their space because all of their products are seamlessly integrated into an ecosystem approach. So, if a homeowner can't afford to buy solar PV, battery and a heat pump all at the same time, they pre-designed them so they're all interoperable and interconnected at the time of installation. So what really makes them unique is their ability. So if you only install the heat pump in the battery and a year later you install Solar PV, it's been seamlessly integrated. So what they've done unique is have their products interoperable and it's underpinned by a digital solution. So you have this one based system that can control all of the various products and also provide greater management. Because if you fast forward to the future, we're all going to get to a point someday where you get home at the same time, you plug in your car, you turn on your heating system. You're putting a lot of reliance on the grid all at the same time. So being able to do grid management and have their products interoperable is very, very unique and they're the only one in the world that does it. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And then just my follow-up would be on the exit side of things Fire & Security and Commercial Refrigeration. Investors may be concerned that you\u2019re buying Viessmann for sort of 17 times or so headline ex synergy EBITDA and worry about sort of the selling prices of F&S and commercial refrigeration versus that. So maybe help us understand kind of how you're thinking about the exit route for those in terms of spins or outright divestment and how you're confident that as we go through this process of sort of \u20ac4 billion of sales out \u20ac4 billion of sales in that the returns and sort of financial criteria looks okay? David Gitlin : Well a few things Julian. First of all, we think of it as buying 13x the fully synergized number. Second, we are going to be bringing in just on a base level more EBITDA than we're selling and then you add synergies to it and it's even more. And the growth rate of Viessmann is far higher than anything else on a sustained basis that we have in the portfolio, including the businesses that we're exiting. In terms of the price that, we'll realize on these divestitures we'll have to see. But what I'd remind folks is that when we sell Chubb we sold that for a 13x multiple. And as great as a business Chubb is with 240 branches, it's largely an installation and services business. Here you're dealing with especially on the fire and security side highly differentiated high gross margin businesses usually with three to five competitors in their spaces they're going to be hugely sought after and we're going to see how -- as we go through the process what's the best way to sell. We may sell it its entirety. We may do a spin. We may sell it off in various pieces some quicker than others. So we'll go through the process. But I think it would be very surprising for us to get anywhere close to -- the multiple on Chubb are lower we would expect it to be materially higher. Julian Mitchell : That's great. Thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Please standby for our next question. The next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, and thanks for the questions. David Gitlin : Good morning. Nigel Coe : So \u2013 good morning. I just wanted to talk about the -- maybe just dig into the free cash flow the high single-digit free cash flow target. Can you maybe just talk about the free cash flow profile for Viessmann over the past several years? Obviously the growth has been very impressive. How is the free cash flow and the CapEx been trending? Maybe more importantly going forward what sort of CapEx investment you see required to sort of execute on this plan? Patrick Goris : Yes, Nigel, Patrick here. So 2023 is still ongoing of course. But the two prior years, we believe that their free cash flow conversion has been in the mid-90s so 90% to 95% of net income. And so clearly we believe that there is a continued path to have a combined company that will be in about 100% free cash flow conversion range. As to CapEx investments clearly given the significant opportunity in heat pumps there have been heavy capital investments made by Viessmann, including in 2023. We have that dial into our numbers. And as I said, we expect going forward to continue to be a company that converts about 100% of net income into free cash flow. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's helpful. So let me just no extraordinary investment requirements. I mean, that's what I hear from that but maybe just clarify that. But just do you want to pick up on Julian's question about the format for the exits. Lots of questions about spin versus sale. Have you ruled out a spin at this point -- the sale of Fire & Security the preferred option? And if you do sell it seems like you've got the capacity to buy more than the 50-odd million shares you're issuing. So is that the upper limit of the buyback, or could that scale up? Patrick Goris : It could scale up Nigel very clearly. And the first part of your comment was related to sale versus spin at the end of the day we're evaluating the exits and ultimately we'll pick whatever the exit is that delivers the best after-tax value for Carrier. And so whether that's the sale versus spin that is what we're focused on. And you're right. If it is a sale we certainly see a path with expected proceeds that would enable us to buy more shares than the equivalent shares issued to Viessmann family. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks very much. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : Please standby for our next question. The next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. David Gitlin : Hey, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Just back to the deal math even, kind of, looking at the shares issue particularly given the $1 billion or so of cash you're going to generate year-to-date, it actually looks to me like there is a path to first year all-in EPS accretion. I just wonder if there's something in I don't know how these guys report. It's a private company, right? If we're talking IFRS or something else. Is there just something in the way they report where we've got to normalize the numbers to conform to a Carrier basis or how would you respond to maybe the potential of upside to what you're saying on accretion versus dilution? Patrick Goris : Yes Jeff, we believe as we have shared on the slide that in year one, let's assume 2024 that we will be modestly dilutive. That would include -- and as I mentioned net income accretive adjusted net income accretive to the company, but given additional shares adjusted EPS modestly dilutive in year one accretive thereafter. Year one we do expect some integration or cost to implement some of the synergies. We think the cost to get to the synergies are relatively modest. We have $200 million of run rate synergies. We think the cost to get to these is maybe one-fourth of those. In addition to that, we have integration expenses that are probably about $100 million or so. We'll see some of that in year one and so that may impact the EPS dilution as well that you calculate in year one. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay. And then just on the exits Patrick, I think, you've appropriately said best after-tax path. Can you just give us a sense of what the tax basis is in the targeted companies? I would assume, it's low and certainly some of them, but perhaps not. And you do have obviously some legacy liability in there right kind of the whole PFAS question. So how might you address that as part of the exit equation? Patrick Goris : Yes. If there is a sales path or assuming a sales path there would be -- we would expect there to be some leakage. We estimate maybe in the mid-teens given a modest tax basis in the assets. So that's the first part of your question. I think when you were referring to some of the legacy liabilities I assume you were referring to ASSS Jeff? Jeffrey Sprague : Yes. Yes. Patrick Goris : Okay. So to the extent there is any ASSS liability at all, we believe it resides within Kidde-Fenwal. And just as we plan to exit Fire & Security, we plan to exit Kidde-Fenwal too and regardless of how we exit Fire & Security could spin well we expect to exit and at the end this to be a clean exit. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Please standby for our next question. The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Good morning. Congratulations, everyone. David Gitlin : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hi, Dave can you maybe just take a step back for us here and talk through how this deal came together? When we had dinner about a year ago you talked about wanting to scale into a European HVAC. I'm just also curious whether there's any potential risk associated with another bidder coming in it doesn't sound like it but just walk us through some of the history and that last piece of the question. David Gitlin : Yes. We -- Joe we have a pretty rigorous strat review process and it was clear from our very early days that when we spend we had two big gaps. We didn't -- we had VRF and we had European residential heating. So we wanted to start with VRF because of the underlying technology that it brings and we were fortunate with both Giwee and Toshiba to be able to enter that market. And then there was really all hands on deck on European residential heating. Clearly, no overlap no antitrust issues. And it was -- if you look across our space and you did a chart showing growth rates predictable growth rates over the next 10 years in every single space in which we compete the single most attractive market is European residential heating and we don't have a real presence there. So we started meeting with effectively every single company across Europe. I had dinners what I would say virtually every CEO in the space and they're a very, very impressive group. It's just very, very difficult to break into that market because they're traditionally multi-generation family-owned businesses. And Max and I had dinner about a year ago in Allendorf, Germany. And I think that we hit it off because we both had this common realization of the art of what's possible. They truly are world-class. I mean they are the leader. If you could pick any company to come together with an European residential heating, it would clearly be Viessmann. They have the best brand, the best channel, the best technology, they are a very, very unique asset with great people. And as we continue to develop the relationship, our whole premise was that one plus one has to be something greater than four. And if you look at the combination of Carrier and Viessmann Climate Solutions we said that we can do something that no other company in the world can do to create value for our people, our shareholders, our customers, and the planet. So, we probably had 15 dinners over the course of the last year as we continue to evolve what this relationship could be. I think the contract is very manages this idea of a potential interloper. Clearly, there'll be a lot of people interested in Viessmann, but we're just thrilled that Max had to share the same vision that we had in the art of what's possible for the future. Joe Ritchie : That's a super helpful answer. Thank you. And then -- and maybe just a quick follow-up to that. You've given us the projections on what you expect the heat pump market to do and your opportunity there. I'm just curious just on the core business, if you went back a decade on this on Viessmann business like what did Viessmann grow? How cyclical was it? And I'm really just trying to understand what the -- as we see the progress and the acceleration in the heat pump market, how we should be thinking about their growth rate? David Gitlin : Well, it's such a unique phenomenon with the shift to heat pump. So, they've traditionally grown the market is a lot like the US where it's an 80% replacement market. People need heating, heating fails, you replace it. The most amazing thing is given that 17 countries in Europe have either announced or banned fossil fuel heating. If you picture you're in a European home, you take a wall-hung boiler off the wall of your bathroom or our utility room, you're going to put in a heat pump and instead of spending a few K, you're going to spend 10K. So, if you pictured no unit rate of growth and the only thing you had was mixing up they'd be growing double-digits. Now, you put on top of that all of their other venues that they have for growth between solar PV and battery that's why they have consistently been growing over recent years in these mid-teens. And if you look at our forecast, it continues to grow at least double-digit rates for the foreseeable future. And I could tell you that there's many parts of our market. If you ask me what are they going to grow in 2025 it will be very difficult for me to answer that sitting here today. This is probably given the energy transition happening in Europe. I would say this is the most predictable sustained growth market in the world. We could give you very high confidence this is going to grow clearly double-digits in 2025, in 2026 because of the underlying dynamics of the mixing up that you're seeing and the additional value add that they provide. Joe Ritchie : Super helpful. I'll leave it there. Operator : The next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Your line is now open. Tommy Moll : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. David Gitlin : Hey Tommy. Tommy Moll : Dave congrats on the deal and now I wanted to talk about resi North America if that's all right. David Gitlin : Yes. Tommy Moll : Just kidding. Let's stick on Viessmann here. I was interested in any more context you could share on their direct-to-installer model. How long ago did they pivot in that direction? Is that primarily only within Germany, or does it also apply outside of Germany? Just any context you can give us there would be appreciated. David Gitlin : Sure. It started about 30 years ago with Martin Viessmann. Professor Dr. Martin Viessmann really had encouraged to see the value in going to this direct-to-installer model. And if you think about Europe in many cases both sell to distributors who sell to wholesalers who sell to installers who sell to the homeowner, both in Germany and many of its other countries, Viessmann Climate Solutions did establish this direct-to-installer model which has so many advantages in Germany and in Europe, not only the obvious that they -- from a margin perspective, but even more importantly is that they end up with a lot of customer intimacy. And what's also happening is that the demand for these heat pumps is so acute throughout Europe that their installers are struggling to just keep up with the underlying demand. So Viessmann themselves have been in there with the homeowners not only helping with some of the replacements, but helping with the new installations. So it has created so much value just having that direct installation customer intimacy. And again, it is not a model that they have that's unique to Germany they have it in many other countries as well. And I think one of the things that really attracted us many of the many things that attracted us to Viessmann, is they're in all the best countries. When you look at the countries that are making the most rapid transition to heat pumps, and you look at the countries that have the highest demand, it is countries like Germany and Poland and Italy and France. So they're really well positioned globally, but certainly within Europe. Tommy Moll : That's helpful. Thank you, David. And I want to follow-up just talking about the market opportunity that you described which if you think about the spend on a per household basis it's a 20x multiplier potentially in a large and fast-growing market. But every other major player in the world is looking at the same market. So if you had to identify what is the core element of the Viessmann moat around this opportunity and how being part of Carrier potentially can help deepen that what would you point us to? David Gitlin : I put point to the channel. Anyone can develop technology. The hardest thing is to access the channel. And that's true in Europe it's true in the United States. You need access because it's not -- these are highly installed highly configured systems. So you need highly trained installers that actually have access to the homeowner. And that's what they have. Viessmann spend a lot of resources investing in training it's extensive installation network. So first is they have access and they have the best access because of their very unique channel model. The second thing is they have the brand that not only in Germany, but it has that German technology. There's a lot of pull for that Viessmann brand. Third is they have the technology. I mentioned Viessmann Invisible. I mentioned that how they've designed their digital overlay and their interconnected system. So they put a lot of energy into natural refrigerants and hydrogen enriched boilers. So a lot of what they've done to build a moat is interconnecting channel brand technology holistic and ecosystem level offerings to really make them a very, very unique asset again not just in Germany, but across Europe. Tommy Moll : Thanks, Dave. I'll turn it back. David Gitlin : Thanks, Tommy. Operator : Please stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Noah Kaye : Thanks, Dave, congratulations. I'm likewise intrigued by the commentary around the battery storage and solar PV opportunity. I think you said in your prepared remarks there was an opportunity to take some of those offerings more broadly across carriers. So I know maybe it's early days of thinking about this, but how might you actually implement that how much you architect similar offerings for the company in North America or other markets? Is this sort of a -- we learned at the start here and then build that over time? David Gitlin : Yeah, I think so. No. We have long been studying how do we connect these dots in North America. And we've been in discussions with solar providers. We've been having a series -- even with our Board just last week, a series of strategy discussions around battery because -- it's not whether it's when these systems get interconnected. When you think about an electric heat pump, you think about solar that relies on DC -- solar producing DC avoiding DC to AC conversion, DC feeding batteries for storage feeding into the heat pumps. These systems are inevitably going to be connected. There are probably more channel complexities in the US than there are in Europe. But we have been working on strategies to really enter the US with a holistic offering. What's really unique about Viessmann is they have a very unique battery capability. So they not -- they only buy the cells but they have a modular concept where they can actually customize the batteries to any size home for any demand they have. So their battery design and capabilities are a bit unique. That may be an initial easier part for the U.S. and then solar may follow. But the first order of business, expand all of their capabilities and investments throughout Europe. Second, we'll be take it to places like the U.S. and globally and we'll have to do that in a phased approach. But again, when we showed our $250 billion TAM at our Investor Day last year we never included Solar PV and Battery that just introduces close to another $50 billion TAM which is tremendous upside and importantly, differentiating. Noah Kaye : Right. If we can talk about heat pump technology and development for a minute there are some differences obviously between your product portfolio and Viessmann they've been -- as you actually mentioned they've been a very vocal advocate for natural refrigerants. How do we think about some of the ways in which their portfolio complements your existing one? How do we think about maybe some product development synergies overtime? David Gitlin : I think that's one of the most exciting things. We haven't factored in any of the revenue synergies into the \u20ac200 million estimate that we gave. But you think about some of the things they do very well. They are very much out in front on natural refrigerants. I mentioned that in terms of their heat pump it actually uses 50% less floor space and it uses significantly less installation time which again when you have a shortage of qualified installers are across Europe that's enormously differentiating and that can provide a lot of value to us per carrier outside of Viessmann. The -- on the flip side with companies like Toshiba, we have world-class inverter technology. We've invested so much over the years in heat exchangers fans air handlers. So there's a lot of technology that we put with our 5,000 engineers today at Carrier a lot of resources into develop world-class compressor designs how we bring that into the Viessmann portfolio as well. So the technology synergies added on with the digital synergies because they have one base we have a bound a lot of the digital subscription type offerings and digital platforms will really cut across both entities seamlessly. Noah Kaye : That's great color. Thanks. David Gitlin : Thank you. Thanks Noah. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. I add my congratulations. David Gitlin : Thank you, Deane. Deane Dray : Dave, I just -- I might have missed this but for Patrick, are you going to move Fire & Security and commercial refrigeration to discontinue? What would that process fee and timing? Patrick Goris : We will do that at the right point. My expectation is that several quarters away and there are some specific requirements that need to be met for us to get there. And so if it happens at all it's going to happen several quarters from now. Deane Dray : Got it. And then, maybe just give us a perspective on Viessmann how they fare during the whole supply chain pressures how did they do in price cost? And any sense about their backlog and past due? David Gitlin : Well, I would say they're very similar to what us, and many other companies experienced. I think the good news is that they'll be coming in with backlog because they experienced some of the same supply chain issues that we all experienced. They navigated it as well if not better than anyone. But look we all ran into some of the same constraints. They're price/cost positive. They've -- one of the very I think exciting -- many exciting things is that they clearly can charge a premium. They have they will continue to be able to do so. So pricing is not an issue for them. And I think that one of the exciting things on the combination is I think we'll bring a lot of value on the cost side with our supply chain. And then keep in mind that if you look at the last few years despite all the supply chain they've been growing 15% sales and EBIT CAGR between 2020 and 2023 and their margins have improved during this time. And in fact Max just told me two nights ago that their margins were exceeded their expectations for March. So they continue to under-promise and over-deliver and I expect that they will continue to do so. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. And can you just clarify in your answer to Tommy's question regarding the distribution model, just going directly to 75,000 installers if it works for them, that's great. I don't think you would try to fix something that's not broken. But how does that strike you in terms of efficiency? David Gitlin : Well, look it's extremely efficient in the European market. One of the things that is in Europe is -- which is a little bit different than the United States is that first you start with distributors then you have wholesalers. And the wholesalers there are typically agnostic. They will carry multiple different brands and they will provide the installer what the installer pulls for. Our distribution channel here in the United States it's typically exclusive. So our distributors are exclusively us and our brands. So I think it's an extremely efficient model there. Our only goal would be to expand it, expand it, invest in it, continue to grow it. And they've done a phenomenal job getting it from where it was 30 years ago to where it is today and we just want to invest in expanding it and continue to make it the truly differentiated channel that it is. Deane Dray : Thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Please standby for the next question. The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Congrats on the deal. Dave, so I know there's been a lot of stimulus and REPowerEU and elements like that that are encouraging the electrification of heat chartered by European IRA where does the product portfolio fit into that? I got to imagine it's on the virtuous side of it, but anything in particular that you're excited about in terms of their lineup that captures something that is going to be a policy target? David Gitlin : Well, if you think about -- there's really -- with all the different legislation throughout Europe either at an EU level or within the countries there's really two aspects to it whether it's the European Green Deal Fit for 55 or REPowerEU, it all really comes down to two things. One is the rapid adoption of renewables, and two is the rapid deployment of heat pumps. And Viessmann is the only one that's well-positioned in both of those. So what's really exciting is if you overlay that with the regulations that these 17 countries are passing, it's literally a once in a generation opportunity. You do not see markets where they're basically forcing you to transition from legacy, fossil fuel boilers to heat pumps and you're going to be charging about up to 4x the price for that replacement. That's a mix up that is unlike any other industry in the world that's anywhere close to our space. So -- it's why it is such a unique phenomenon and such an attractive and compelling reason to want to get in. And put Max's credit, they were the first to see the truly value add that you can create for the homeowner by interconnecting these systems I mentioned that your energy bill can be 80% less if you buy all of these systems together, which is a huge, huge number. And then you add on to it this existential risk with a year ago half of the gas for Europe coming from Russia. So the imperative to become energy independent and rapidly transition to heat pumps and renewables, it's not a nice to have it's a must-have for Europe. And we all know Europe dashed a bit of a bullet this past year because it was a fairly mild winter, but the clock is ticking on energy independence in Europe, so countries are pushing it and there is no one better positioned to lead in that transition than Viessmann. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the pricing comment. I think from Deane's question. I think in the US, there aren't a lot of markets out there that have I'll call it lack of transparency to the end consumer the way resi HVAC does in a good way in terms of not a lot of pushback, not a lot of context what these things should cost. How does that work in Europe for the Viessmann product? Is it just, hey, a list price this is what you pay, or is there a little bit of configuration and extra costs that maybe cloud that a bit? David Gitlin : Yeah. I mean these are highly configured systems. So I think the dynamic is very much what you see in the United States. Even -- I'll just take a small example of battery. You can have different size home with different sized demands and that's why they have Viessmann innovated a modular design because every home is slightly different. So they are typically customized highly configured, highly technical and the price is really something that's between the homeowner and the installer. So there is a lot of variability and not as much I guess ubiquitous transparency. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Congrats again. David Gitlin : Thanks, Josh. Operator : Please stand-by for the next question. The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho Group. Your line is now open. Brett Linzey : Good morning and congratulations. David Gitlin : Thanks, Brett. Brett Linzey : I wanted to just come back to the revenue synergies. I understand, you're not contemplating in the deal framework, but are you able to maybe dimension what the potential revenue synergies could look like as you propagate some of the legacy technologies in the different markets? David Gitlin : Yes. Internally Brett, we have some numbers that we put on it, but I think it's early days. We need to let the team get in there and really and drive them. And then as we get traction, we'll start to put more meat on the bone on dimensionalizing those. But if you think about it, their channel with the 75,000 installers that they have these intimate relationship with, that we could clearly introduce a second brand into their channel, whether it's Carrier Toshiba, that would be a very, very exciting opportunity. You think about their digital connectivity, they have a whole bunch of, I would say world-class digital solutions, they have smart thermostat that we could really use very much, throughout Europe but outside of Europe. We could bring that into North America. We could bring that into Asia. Because one of the things we've been working on is digital connectivity with our distributor and dealer network, but also potentially with the homeowner as well. So, as we bring their technology outside into our channel, we bring some of our brands into their channel and then we leverage our respective underlying technologies. I think the revenue synergies will end up being far more exciting when we look back five years from now, we will have gotten -- truthfully will have exceeded our cost synergies, because that's what we do. What we will end up being more excited about, is the revenue synergies. Brett Linzey : Yes. No, that makes sense. Maybe just one on the quarter. HVAC orders were up double digits organically, commercial backlog up. I guess, as you think about the HVAC commercial business, I mean, are you seeing any cracks from the bank turmoil. And then I guess secondarily, with the supply chain is improving and the shipments out of backlog improving, where do you see backlog landing at the end of the year in the commercial business? David Gitlin : Well, look backlog, when we look at commercial HVAC, backlog was up 20% organically. We had very strong orders in the quarter for commercial HVAC, what we're seeing is continued growth across the globe frankly. We saw sales up mid-teens in the quarter. Aftermarket was up just under 20%. Controls was up just under 20% and commercial applied was up in the mid-teens. So, when we look at orders, we're very pleased with what we're seeing, especially North America. China orders were a bit down in the quarter, but we think that is timing. We think, we're very bullish on what we're going to see for China orders this year, because as that country starts to come back. And I'll tell you interestingly, in the middle of all the banking issues that we were all watching, March was the first month since September of last year, where the Architectural Billing Index was north of 50. So, I think, we all have -- we're all watching, whether or not that could create some constraints on demand. We've seen none of it in the underlying business. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks. David Gitlin : Thanks, Brett. Operator : Please stand-by for the next question. The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Andrew Obin : Hey guys. Good morning and congratulations. David Gitlin : Thanks, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question, can you talk a little bit more about the solar, business because it's a fairly large chunk of the company. And I just want to understand better, what does the company does there? And I guess, how does it fit strategically with your HVAC vision? Thank you. David Gitlin : Well, the beauty of their solar PV that they've gotten into recently is, it's really part of a broader solution. There's a lot of players globally that do some level of solar PV. The issue with Viessmann is they're the only player kind of directly in our space that has it as a core offering. And the reason that's important is it's part of a broader ecosystem of offering. So it's not that people should think of them as a pure-play solar PV, someone should think about them as an energy management solution provider. So as more and more regulations are passed throughout Europe, they're saying here's how much heating you can use \u2013 you as a homeowner, here's how much carbon emissions that you're allowed to have. A typical homeowner has no idea how to navigate achieving certain targets that are being given. So what you really want is a one-stop shop. You want someone who can come in and say \"I can help you achieve these objectives that you have instead of reducing your thermostat to 64 degrees in the middle of a cold winter, here's how you can achieve the objectives that the government has set up for you and it's that interconnectivity of a solar PV that seamlessly interacts with a wall-hung battery plus the heat pump plus a grid management, energy management, digital solution, it's that interconnectivity that makes it such an important part of their portfolio. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just a question on synergies. And I completely appreciate that the deal is a lot more about heat pump market tripling in Europe and channel synergies, et cetera, et cetera and revenue synergies totally get it. But 5% recent deals were more like 8% to 10% in the industry. So I'm thinking about 5% and we've also been getting questions on the headline and the FT that Germany will review sale of Viessmann, how does that just basically buying a storied middles the German company, how does that figure into your approach to costs in this deal? And what can you do going forward? Thank you. David Gitlin : Well, what I'd say, Andrew is first your observation that 5% seems conservative, I would agree with. I do think your typical synergies are in the high single-digits and that's been I think our experience. I think that \u2013 so is it conservative that we would get to $200 million, the vast majority of which is by year three? Perhaps. I do think we were pragmatic and very focused on what we're trying to do with this integration. We are not coming in guns blazing. This is a very well-run business. This has as I mentioned one ERP system, this is a phenomenal business. So this is not about headcount reductions. They have 11,000 people. We are not coming in to reduce G&A heads. We're not coming in to close factories it's the opposite. We're coming in to invest in Germany, invest in the workforce, invest in growth because the worst thing you can do in the middle at the very outset of a huge growth opportunity is start to squeeze costs and not build for the capacity to keep up with the demand that is so clearly in front of them. So we got low-hanging fruit on the synergies with the in-sourcing procurement. That's an easy go do. We know how to do that, Viessmann knows how to do that together. We're just going to go make that happen. Well the number end up being higher we'll see. But our focus will be on those two pieces of the synergies. And then equally important will be driving the revenue synergies. Andrew Obin : David and Sam Congratulations. I know how impossible these companies together. Congratulations on getting this deal done. David Gitlin : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Please standby for the next question. The next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Nicole DeBlase : Yes Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Just a couple of more financial questions. So going back to I think Jeff Sprague asked this question towards the beginning of the call. Would you \u2013 do we need to make any adjustments to the EBITDA figure that you guys included in the slides as presumably Viessmann would need to transition from IFRS to GAAP? Patrick Goris : Nicole, Patrick here. We believe that there is a good approximation of US GAAP. So from all the due diligence certainly good work, yes. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. Thank you for confirming that. And then with respect to the synergies the $200 million, how should we think about the phasing of that? I think typically sourcing can take a little bit longer like tends to be towards the end of a synergy process in a deal. So is that more back-end loaded across the three years or will you start to get some of those synergies upfront? Thank you. Patrick Goris : Yes Nicole, we expect that by year three, the vast majority of those synergies will be achieved. So think about 75%. David Gitlin : And what I'd say is the phasing is \u2013 the in-sourcing is a go do. There might be some minor tweaking to the product. But Toshiba is already in Europe. So in terms of qualification I don't see that as a major issue. So I think that in-sourcing will be I think relatively quick sourcing frankly could be relatively quick as well. So I think it's -- what typically takes longer is if you start closing factories and things like that that is not part of any part of our calculation. So I think achieving these relatively within the next couple of years is quite doable. Nicole DeBlase : Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : Please standby for the next question. The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Steve Tusa : Hi. Good morning. Congrats. David Gitlin : Thanks, Steve. Patrick Goris : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Any margin differences between these various businesses within Viessmann the pie chart there? Patrick Goris : No, I'd say that the margins for things like boilers heat pump services are all similar. Batteries might be slightly lower or solar a bit lower than that. But I think the nice thing is that the margins on boilers and heat pumps because we are going through that transition are very similar. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then just Patrick on the guidance any moving parts on bridge items? And then just any color on kind of the cadence first quarter to second quarter the seasonality that you guys expect this year? Patrick Goris : Yes, Steve. So in essence our prior guide assumed $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases. We are pausing that. With that we lose about $0.04, $0.05 versus our February guide. That's being offset given Q1 performance, but also some adjustments on interest income, for example, that you see in the back of the slide deck. In terms of timing for the balance of the year, the way we think about this in February, I mentioned that first half adjusted EPS would be a little less than half of the full year. Given our performance in Q1, we think that first half and second half EPS will be very similar at the midpoint of our guidance of $2.55. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just any update on price cost and the spread there? What was that in the first quarter? And what do you expect now for the year? Patrick Goris : So price cost was slightly positive in Q1, and we expect the Q1 price cost to be the most difficult for what we said in February. We expect price cost for the full year to be positive and we expect it also to have a slightly positive impact on margins. Steve Tusa : And then one last one. How much price do you now expect for the year? Patrick Goris : We still expect most of the organic growth for this year to be priced. So it's now in the call it in the $400 million $500 million range Steve. Steve Tusa : Okay. Great. Thanks all the details and congrats again on the deal. I think everybody covered most of the questions I had. Thanks. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Steve. David Gitlin : Thanks, Steve. And I was handed a note by Sam that my mic cut out during Fire & Security. And so I apologize for that. What I was basically saying is, what's on the slide that for Fire & Security, it's great businesses, great teams, great leading positions. You all know the brands and how the growth potential. I was clarifying that even though $3.6 billion of sales, we're going to retain the UTEC business, which makes controls for HVAC and refrigeration. So it's a natural part to keep in our portfolio. The business we're exiting therefore is about $3.1 billion and has EBITDA margins in the high teens. It's split between fire at $2.1 billion, securities around $1 billion. And like I said upfront, it's -- this was a very, very difficult decision. Jurgen and his team have done a phenomenal job creating a world-class business, that's highly differentiated, and it's a true unique asset that I know many, many will be extremely interested. But just because it's such a phenomenal business doesn't mean that it belongs in our portfolio. So we had to make a very tough decision to exit those businesses. And we'll use those proceeds as Patrick said, we'll pay down some debt. We'll do a buyback and then we'll continue to invest in our core business of being the global leader in intelligent, climate and energy solutions. So a tough decision but I think the right decision for the long term of the business. And with that we will leave it there. I do thank all of you for your flexibility moving this up a day. And I just want to reiterate my thanks to our employees and to the 11,000 Viessmann employees that will become part of our family. This is -- I think, this is a once in a generation opportunity to truly bring two world-class phenomenal organizations together to be an unambiguous global leader, and I couldn't be excited about the days that lay ahead. So, my thanks to all of you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. The company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Once the call is open for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to give everyone the opportunity to participate. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Our theme at Carrier remains \"performing while transforming,\" and I am proud of our team as we are progressing well with both. You see that strong performance in our Q2 results on Slide 2. Organic sales growth grew 6% with both HVAC and Fire & Security up 9%. We drove strong double-digit growth in light commercial and commercial HVAC, global truck and trailer, controls and aftermarket. Within Fire & Security, growth was broad based across security, residential, commercial and industrial fire. Total company backlog remains well above historical levels, up 30% on a two-year stack. Adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS were up 12% and 13%, respectively, and free cash flow was strong at over $300 million. Price/cost was increasingly positive in Q2, Toshiba Carrier performance came in stronger than expected, and we are on track to deliver $300 million of gross productivity this year. As a result of our strong first half performance, we are raising our full year guidance for organic growth, adjusted operating margins and adjusted EPS. A key driver of our sustained organic growth and robust backlog is the result of our team leaning into secular trends around sustainability and healthy buildings, as you see on Slide 3. With our clear and unwavering focus on being the global leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions, we continue to see traction from our sustainability-driven growth initiatives. Resi heat pump sales in North America have been up double-digits year-to-date, we saw another quarter of over 20% growth in commercial heat pump sales in Europe, and electric transport units doubled in Europe. Our healthy buildings pipeline is up over 2x to $1.6 billion, driven in part by K-12 in the U.S., where orders were up over 20% in the quarter. We are clearly positioned at the core of a transition to a more sustainable planet. We published our 2030 ESG report yesterday in which we now disclose sustainability progress through the CDP. After completing our portfolio moves, about half of our sales will relate directly to clean tech, and we expect that proportion to continue to increase. We remain on track to reduce our customers' carbon emissions by more than 1 gigaton by 2030, while achieving carbon neutrality in our own operations. Our laser-focus on digitally-enabled aftermarket solutions continues to gain traction as you see on Slide 4. Q2 saw yet another quarter of double-digit aftermarket growth with the first half up mid-teens compared to last year, and we remain on track to deliver double-digit growth this year and beyond. The playbook is working : expanding the capabilities and deployment of Abound and Lynx, our key digital platforms; increasing part sales supported by agile pricing and improved fulfillment rates; increased attachment rates and overall coverage across the portfolio; and deploying connected devices to increase recurring and subscription-based revenues. We're also embedding AI and generative AI capabilities into Abound to drive solutions for our customers. By analyzing sensor data patterns and performance metrics, generative AI can help prevent equipment failures, drive improved air quality by controlling ventilation, and increase energy efficiency by controlling temperature set point, air flow rates and scheduling strategies. So, our execution is progressing well. A brief update on our portfolio transformation on Slide 5. On Viessmann Climate Solutions, the short version is, the more we get to know them, the more excited we are to close. Our integration planning team in Frankfurt is actively working to ensure that we hit the ground running on day one. Viessmann Climate Solutions is performing very well, ahead of their projections. First half sales were up an impressive 20% year-over-year, with heat pump sales up over 40%. Viessmann Climate Solutions' profitability is also up significantly compared to last year and they remain on track to deliver \u20ac4 billion in sales and \u20ac700 million in EBITDA this year. We remain confident in the \u20ac200 million of cost synergies, driven primarily by supply chain, insourcing and value engineering. The growth opportunity for the combined business is even more compelling. The prime focus areas include expanding Viessmann's sustainable heating and home energy management offerings globally, driving incremental sales through Viessmann's European channel using a multi-brand strategy, and building on Viessmann's digital platform to provide even more differentiated end-to-end solutions globally. Moving to the Fire & Security and commercial refrigeration exits. The good news is that strategics and sponsors have expressed considerable interest in these superb assets. We are tracking to the sequencing we've established for these exits. We expect to have commercial refrigeration, now including Profoid mechanical systems, and the security business in the market in September, with Residential Fire initiating its sale process a month or so later. Commercial and Residential Fire exits will follow. The result is the new Carrier that you see on Slide 6. The combination of the acquisitions of Toshiba Carrier and Viessmann Climate Solutions, together with the tremendous positioning that Carrier has established over the past century, position the combined entity to become a true global climate champion in very attractive and growing market segments. Focus matters. And our focus on sustainability, differentiation position us as a pure-play high-growth company. Our combined channels, brands, technologies and world-class talents will create solutions for our customers, our people and the planet for generations to come. And, with that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7. We had record reported sales of about $6 billion, up 15% versus the prior year, with 6% organic growth. 9% growth from acquisitions and divestitures was substantially driven by Toshiba Carrier, whose results will become organic starting in August. The deconsolidation of KFI was not material to Q2 total company sales, but had a 3 point negative year-over-year impact to the Fire & Security segment's reported sales. Q2 adjusted operating profit of $964 million was up 12% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 16.1% and includes a 100 basis point headwind from the consolidation of Toshiba Carrier. This means adjusted operating margins would have expanded about 60 basis points, excluding the impact from the TCC consolidation, driven by volume, productivity and price/cost, as well as strong margins in TCC. Core earnings conversion was about 30% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $0.79 was ahead of our expectations, mostly because of stronger-than-expected sales, price/cost and TCC performance. Free cash flow generation of $310 million was up significantly compared to last year, helped by inventory reduction. This positions us well to deliver approximately $1.9 billion of free cash flow for the full year. You will notice that our U.S. GAAP results include the impact of the deconsolidation of KFI, and the mark-to-market adjustments related to foreign currency hedges associated with the Viessmann acquisition. You may recall that we fully hedged the cash portion of the euro-dominated purchase price. As of yesterday's rates, most of the Q2 non-cash loss on the hedges would be neutralized. We exclude these items from our adjusted results. Now, please turn to Slide 8 to cover our segments performance in more detail. HVAC had an excellent performance in Q2. Organic sales were up 9%, driven by high-teens growth in commercial HVAC, double-digit growth in aftermarket and controls, and over 60% growth in light commercial. North America residential HVAC sales were down mid-single digits in the quarter, a bit weaker than we expected. Overall, residential volumes were down mid-teens, as we adjusted to slower-than-expected movements in the quarter. North America residential revenues continued to benefit from price realization and mix up from the 2023 SEER transition. Adjusted operating profit for the HVAC segment was up 29% compared to last year, driven by volume, productivity, TCC performance and favorable price/cost. Adjusted operating margin was up 70 basis points compared to last year, despite a 200 basis point headwind from the consolidation of TCC. All three businesses within HVAC had strong margin expansion : Residential light commercial, commercial and global comfort solutions. Based on the first half performance, we now expect 2023 full year HVAC segment margins to be closer to 16% versus our prior guide of over 15%. Let me move to Slide 9 and provide a brief update on our Toshiba Carrier acquisition as we closed that transaction about one year ago. As a reminder, we acquired Toshiba Carrier for $900 million, about 10x EBIT. We committed to $100 million in cost synergies in five years and projected to achieve mid-teens EBITDA margins in that same timeframe. Our Tokyo-based team is doing an outstanding job and performance is running ahead of all of our projections. Japan returned to profitability earlier this year. We are already achieving double-digit operating margins and are now projecting $200 million of cost synergies, which would drive EBITDA margins in the high-teens rather than mid-teens. In short, excellent performance by that management team and we are, of course, using their experience and playbook as we plan for the Viessmann integration. Moving to Refrigeration on Slide 10. Reported sales were down 7% in the quarter with organic sales down 6%. The difference is a small divestiture we discussed in the first quarter. Within transport refrigeration, North America truck and trailer sales were up double digits and European truck/trailer was up mid-teens. This continued strong performance was more than offset by container, which was down roughly 35% in the quarter year-over-year. Importantly, we delivered more container units sequentially and we expect these sequential improvements to continue in Q3 and Q4. As a result, we expect the container business and the entire Refrigeration segment to return to organic sales growth in the second half of this year. Commercial refrigeration was down high-teens year-over-year as our European food retail customers continue to see pressures. The commercial refrigeration team is doing a great job managing working capital and adjusting our cost base to position this business for strong financial performance as the top-line improves. Adjusted operating margin was down 240 basis points compared to last year, mainly due to the volume declines in container and commercial refrigeration, and the absence of the $7 million gain in last year's second quarter. Price/cost was favorable. Excluding the one-time gain on sale in the first quarter, Q2 adjusted operating margins for Refrigeration grew 250 basis points sequentially from Q1 and we are pleased with the progress this segment made in the quarter. Moving on to Fire & Security on Slide 11. Fire & Security sales were up 5% on a reported basis. Organic sales were up 9%. This was partially offset by 1% currency and a 3% decline from the deconsolidation of KFI. We saw a strong organic growth across the F&S portfolio, including double-digit growth in industrial fire and security and a high-single digit growth in both residential and commercial fire. Adjusted operating profit was up 1% versus the prior year, which includes the year-over-year headwind from the deconsolidation of KFI, which was about $10 million, or about $0.01 of adjusted EPS for Carrier. Adjusted operating margins were down 50 bps in the quarter as favorable price/cost, volume and productivity were offset by mix and the year-over-year impact of the KFI deconsolidation. Sequentially, adjusted operating margins were up 230 basis points and we expect adjusted operating margins to improve as the year progresses. Turning to Slide 12. Total company organic orders were down mid-single digits in the quarter as lead times continue to normalize throughout our business. As you can see on the left, backlogs remain at very healthy levels, about 2x 2019 levels, and for our longer-cycle businesses, extend into next year. We believe that strong backlogs and normalizing supply chains are reflected in our order rates. Overall, HVAC orders were down 5% to 10% in the quarter with both business units seen some declines. Commercial HVAC orders were down mid-single digits, but the backlog remains robust and grew sequentially, excluding NORESCO. Over the past month, commercial HVAC orders have returned to growth. The Refrigeration orders were up 10% in the quarter with growth in transport refrigeration and a decline in commercial refrigeration. Global truck and trailer demands remained strong with orders up above 40% and those were partially offset by declines in container. Container orders were about flat sequentially as demand begins to recover. Orders in industrial fire remained strong and were up double-digits. With lead times improving in security and commercial fire, orders moderated and were down in the quarter. Now, moving on to guidance on Slide 13. Performance in the first half of 2023 was better than we expected. We now expect 2023 revenues to be a couple of hundred million dollars more than $22 billion with mid-single digits organic growth. The increase is primarily driven by commercial and light commercial HVAC, and somewhat higher net price. We now expect adjusted operating margins to be between 14% and 14.5%, a little higher than what we previously guided, driven by slightly higher organic sales, improved price/cost and better performance at Toshiba Carrier. We now expect full year price/cost to be about $300 million positive for the year. As a result, despite a $0.03 adjusted EPS headwind from the deconsolidation of KFI, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.05, and we expect full year adjusted EPS to be at the mid-point of the new range. For your benefit, we included an adjusted EPS guide-to-guide bridge on Slide 17. As to free cash flow, we continue to expect to generate approximately $1.9 billion this year. So, overall, another good quarter and an improved outlook for 2023. With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Dave. David Gitlin : Okay. Thanks, Patrick. Let me first correct something that I misstated on the business exits. We expect to have commercial refrigeration and security in the market in September, industrial fire a month or so later, and then resi and commercial fire will follow. So, just in summary before we get into the Q&A, Carrier continues performing while we are transforming. Despite resi HVAC declines, we've realized mid-single-digit organic growth in the first half of 2023; secular trends and our aftermarket focus continue to drive demand; price/cost improvements and productivity are helping operating margins and funding growth investments; Toshiba performance is well ahead of schedule and giving us further confidence in the upcoming Viessmann integration; our exciting portfolio moves are tracking to schedule; and we are raising full year guidance for organic growth, adjusted operating margins and adjusted EPS. And, with that, we will get into the questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, Dave and Patrick. David Gitlin : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Good morning. Dave, would love your view on kind of the political wrangling in Germany on the heat pump related incentives and how that plays into or does not play into your view on kind of Viessmann growth as you look forward in the next couple of years. David Gitlin : Well, we're confident in the Viessmann growth regardless of specifically how the German legislation plays out. I mean, keep in mind, the proposed legislation that's being debated now was proposed in April, well after we had already approved our business case. And what we're going to see in Germany is a clear transition to heat pumps. We're going to see continued -- you may see more district heating than we thought previously, which will be good for us. So, what we know is that regardless of whatever legislation gets approved in September, our business case stands fully intact and perhaps what Viessmann continues to do is under-promise and over-deliver. And that's what we saw in the first half of the year. I mentioned, 20% overall growth, 40% growth in heat pumps without this proposed legislation. And, by the way, Germany is less than 50% of their total sales. I think, it's just over 40%. And more broadly, in Europe, there are 17 countries that have announced or implemented bans on fossil fuels, 19 countries in total have heat pump incentives, 12 European countries have bans on fossil fuel boilers for newbuilds. So, look, we'll continue to monitor the specific German legislation, but our competence in the transition away from fossil fuels towards electric heat pumps, towards solar PV, towards batteries remains very, very confident. Jeffrey Sprague : And then, also, maybe you could elaborate a little bit more on the link you're indicating between [TFC] (ph) and Viessmann. And, I guess, the sport -- the spirit of my question, right, is, Viessmann is not about headcount reductions and, culturally, those are difficult, and I don't think a big part of what you've done at [TFC] (ph), but you are seeing better synergy capture. So maybe just elaborate a little bit on what you mean by that playbook and lessons learned that you're going to apply to Viessmann? David Gitlin : Yeah. Look, the first aspect of the playbook in TCC has been cultural integration with a multi-country representation, pulling together as one team to drive results for our customers. You look at what Saif Siddiqui and the team have done there, it's really been being very culturally sensitive to what's working extremely well and not breaking what works well and just focusing clearly on value creation. We had similar constraints in terms of headcount in Japan that we do with Germany. Most of the synergies which, as Patrick said, will be far higher than the $100 million. We're looking at, at least, $200 million now for TCC. That's coming from the same kind of areas. It's coming from sourcing, it's coming from value engineering, there are some elements of insourcing. So, that same playbook on the cost synergy side applies there. But we're also seeing tremendous synergies on the revenue side. Toshiba has tremendous technology that we've cascaded globally. Viessmann Climate Solutions has tremendous technology that we plan to cascade globally. We want to be very culturally sensitive. And, look, Viessmann Climate Solutions is a phenomenally well-run company. Thomas Heim will be running the -- our European business, which will include Riello. Our goal is to make sure that we allow them to go do what they know how to do better than anyone in the world, while we look for areas of combined value creation. That's worked with Toshiba and that same playbook will work here. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. Thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning. David Gitlin : Good morning, Steve. Patrick Goris : Good morning. Steve Tusa : Just turning towards resi and light commercial. On the resi side, where do you see channel inventories now relative to where you were in the first quarter? David Gitlin : Yeah. When we look at inventory levels, Steve, we basically closed 2Q in balance. And underneath that, furnaces were down about mid-single digits. Splits were higher than we would have liked. We do expect some destocking there in the second half. And what I'll say more broadly, Steve, is that, obviously you know, we get a lot of questions on resi and we've been saying that it's 20% of our portfolio and that we can grow, of course, with resi down and that's exactly what we saw in the last quarter. We saw HVAC grow 9%, with resi being down mid-single digits. So, look, as we calibrate where we are for resi for the rest of the year, remember, for the full year, we said that sales will be flat with volume down high-single digits. That still feels about right to us, even though 2Q was a little bit lower than we had thought, because we will see some level of destocking on splits in the second half, but when you look at it more recently, obviously, the heat wave will translate into movement, which will help our replacement business. We had thought that the new construction piece -- we came into the year saying, residential new construction will be down 20% to 25%. That looks like it's going to be better than we thought, probably down closer to 10% or so. So, as we look at the full year, we still feel calibrated in what we said. I mean, could it -- instead of it being flat, could it be down a point or two perhaps. But we're still in the zone. And, remember, in the second half of the year, we have easier comparison. We're pleased with some of the recent trends. The only other thing I'll say on inventory levels is, splits was down sequentially in terms of inventory levels in the channel. Steve Tusa : And then, light commercial, these are pretty big numbers, you're catching up on backlog, obviously, but even backlogs up a lot. I mean, like, what's the driver of that? And is that like a tough comp for next year at all? These are like some pretty big numbers on light commercial. David Gitlin : Well, look, anytime you produce sales over 60%, you create inherently a tough comp. But, look, I think, we could not be more pleased with how Justin and Christian and the light commercial team are doing, and it's -- frankly, it's a good example of where we've invested in technology differentiation. We are seeing results in growth and share gains. We've talked a lot about this vane axial fan, which is far more energy-efficient than the previous generation, and that has proven to help us take share the right way, because we've been getting a lot of price. We talked about 60% sales, but about half of that was volume and the other half was about price and mix and a whole bunch of other things. Because, remember, there's mix involved in light commercial just like there is in the residential piece. So, overall, light commercial, it wasn't an easy compare in terms of -- versus 2Q of last year, but that team is performing very well. We'll continue to track inventory levels in the channel there. But the good news is, backlog is very robust. Backlog is up over 60% year-over-year, and it gives us strong coverage through the rest of 2023 that extends into 2024. Steve Tusa : Got it. Great. Thanks a lot. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just a first question perhaps for Patrick around the cadence of sort of earnings and the top-line within the second half. So, should we be thinking that sort of EPS is flattish sequentially in Q3 and then a normal step down? And then, on the organic sales front, I think you grew low- to mid-single digit organically first half and then the year is up sort of mid-single. So, do we think about an acceleration year-on-year kind of in Q4 being up, I don't know, mid- or high--single digit, is that the way to think about sales? Patrick Goris : Julian, on the first question, you can think of operating profit being very similar in Q3 than in Q2. A key difference will be the effective tax rate, we think, will be closer to 25%. And basically, that gets you to an EPS that's very similar, maybe $0.01 or $0.02 below. And so then you have after that normal drop-down in Q4 that you were referring to. So that's kind of the sequence. In terms of organic growth for the full year, we are now at mid-single digits, which is better than the low- to mid-single which we had before. Similar organic growth in Q3 that we expect as we've seen in Q2. And then the balance, of course, would be in Q4, which means that Q4 would be a little weaker. That's our current assumption. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. And then just my second question, looking at Slide 12, where you have the backlog trend chart on the left-hand side and, clearly, different markets and geographies sort of rebalancing, lower at different times as lead times shorten. But when you're thinking about the backlog trends from here next, call it, six to 12 months, just wondered how you're thinking about kind of the aggregate for Carrier. Do we see the backlog naturally moderate because of normalizing supply chains? Just any thoughts around that, please? Patrick Goris : Julian, that is what we were looking at it. Then, I think, it depends to what businesses we're looking at. If you look at some of our shorter-cycle businesses and we've seen that the best example is probably residential HVAC. Typically, we would have four maybe six weeks in backlog. A few quarters ago, we were talking of backlog more than one quarter. And so, as supply chains have normalized, we've seen the backlog normalized for, for example, residential HVAC. We're back in that four to six-week range and you don't get to that without an adjustment of the order intake, and that's why we've seen some of the big declines in orders year-over-year as those backlogs normalize. So, I would expect that some -- for some of our short-cycle businesses, we will see a more back to normal backlog level. At the same time, there are some longer-cycle businesses, like commercial HVAC, those are businesses that have backlogs of six months, in some cases longer, and there we see continued growth and we see continued strong demand. David Gitlin : Yeah. What I'd add, Julian, is that, if you look at sort of the anomalies of the environment that we've seen over the last couple of years, COVID leading into supply chain issues, looking purely at year-over-year order trends is really not the best indicator of future growth projections. So, what we've been looking a lot is the backlog levels, which we feel still very good about with commercial, light commercial, HVAC, and some of the longer pieces of Fire & Security, we like where the backlog levels are. So, we're looking at, do we have the backlog and incoming growth order rates to support our growth projections, and we do feel good about those. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. David Gitlin : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, I was hoping to go through some of the price/cost dynamics in the quarter and you mentioned the higher mix contribution from the new SEER. Could you take us through that? And then, the pace of improving price/cost, that $300 million, what was the -- if you can decompose that, how much was, let's say, the raw material better pricing there as well? Thanks. Patrick Goris : Okay. Deane, Patrick here. In terms of the quarter, you can think of the 6% organic growth we had, think of that as pricing being about 4 points, and think of volume and mix, so we put the mix up as part of the volume/mix as being the remainder 2 points. So, that's kind of the overview for the quarter. For the full year, we think that the price realization -- it won't be 4%. We think it will be a little less than 4% for the full year, probably closer to 3%, which is, of course, to be expected as we lap some of the price increases from last year. And then, the second part of your question was? Deane Dray : Just the -- you said the pace of improving price/cost. Patrick Goris : Yes. You may recall that in Q1, we mentioned that price/cost was modestly positive. It has a few tens of basis points positive impact on our segment operating margin, and we said that Q1 would be the weakest price/cost of the year. You can think now of price/cost being closer to $300 million positive versus $200 million the prior guide, and it's about 100 bps benefit for the full year year-over-year, so better than in Q1, which is basically what we expected. In terms of the equation, both price -- is a little bit better. On the cost side, we're seeing some pluses and minuses. The area where we probably see the best, the most favorable impact is on logistics. Deane Dray : All right. Patrick Goris : Yes, we're seeing [similar] (ph) materials, there are some plus and minuses there, but logistics and freight is probably the area where we see the biggest benefit on the cost equation. Deane Dray : That's real helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Dave, you gave a lot of specifics on the sale processes going on and the timing and so forth, which is really helpful. And just from a management side to this, how do you keep each one of the units focused when there is this change in ownership pending? And just how do you keep the eye on the ball here? David Gitlin : Well, we are so fortunate to have a phenomenal team in both Fire & Security and commercial refrigeration. Jurgen and his team in Fire & Security, Tim working with Marcus on commercial refrigeration, they're true professionals. And they know what we know, which is that the opportunity for these businesses in the hands of someone who's either a strategic or a sponsor who is the core of what they do, will create value for their people for generations to come. So, we are very lucky. It's one of the reasons why the decision was so tough, because we're parting with team members that come to work every day, put their heads down and do a phenomenal job for their customers and create value. They're performing very well. So, we're lucky to have great people. We work closely with them to paint the vision for the future for them in their businesses. Phenomenal franchises, phenomenal brands. I've been very, very pleased with the level of interest, and we've shared that with both respective teams. So, we know it's just like when Carrier spun, there was a fair amount of uncertainty as we spun from UTC. But we knew that, and Greg knew that, us as an independent company would create value for us and our customers and the same will be true for them. Deane Dray : Thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. David Gitlin : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : I just want to go back to price and maybe mix, Patrick. Obviously, light commercial is 60% growth. How much of that would have been price and mix? And maybe the $300 million of price/cost, if you can just maybe be a bit more granular in terms of how that phases through the year? Patrick Goris : Yes, for light commercial, more than half would be volume and the remainder about equally split between the mix up and the price realization. And then on price/cost, the way you can think about it, Nigel, is -- I mentioned $300 million for the full year, I mentioned 100 bps benefit for the full year, weakest by far was Q1. The next two quarters will be similar, and I think Q4 will be a little bit stronger than Q1. So, I can't share the exact numbers by quarter, but, clearly, we've seen a significant pickup in the second quarter. We expect that to continue for the year. And from a year-over-year margin perspective, the margin impact on Q2, Q3, Q4 will be similar to get to the 100 bps for the year. So, basically, a little over 100 bps every quarter, Q2, Q3, Q4. That's kind of the granularity I have. Nigel Coe : That's great. Thanks, Patrick. And then my follow-on is coming back to the portfolios. I mean, based on the indication of interest you've clearly seen from both PE and strategics, are you at a point now where you can rule out the spin process? Do you think there's a buyer out there potentially for the whole package of assets, maybe excluding commercial refrigeration, but the whole Fire & Security assets? And I know there's many parts to this question, but is the KFI Chapter 11 still a gating factor for the fire sales? Thanks. David Gitlin : Yeah. The way I would describe it, Nigel, is that for commercial refrigeration and then the security business and industrial fire, those will be divestitures. We mentioned that we'd have the first two of those three. We're targeting having those in the market a bit after Labor Day. So, we're targeting having those out in the market before the end of September. And then, industrial fire will follow a month or so later, and that will also -- we also plan that to be a divestiture. And we're still weighing through all of our options with respect to the commercial and residential fire pieces of that portfolio. And those can take a whole bunch of different forms. They can be divestitures, spin, split like that. The different forms those can take and go in a lot of directions, and we're going to be weighing all of those. But, right now, we're focused primarily on those first three to make progress and try to get signed executed deals here in the coming months on those. And in terms of the KFI process, that's being, of course, handled by the independent Board of KFI. It's our sense that they've been progressing well and appropriately through the Chapter 11 process. All of the AFFF litigation against KFI was automatically stayed upon the filing. And, since then, all of the AFFF claims against Carrier and F&S have also been stayed, and that came with the consent of the Creditors Committee. So, that whole process is proceeding as planned. We anticipate the sale process that the Board will do for KFI will begin as they start to sell themselves in the next couple of months. And then, within the next year, we do anticipate Chapter 11 discharge for KFI, which would resolve the AFFF lawsuits against KFI carrier and the other entities. So, I think, that's progressing as I think their Board would have expected it to progress. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks, Dave. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. David Gitlin : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Just -- maybe just starting off on the lead times normalizing comment. I'm just curious, how far above normal are we still with lead times? And when do you expect that to fully normalize? David Gitlin : Joe, it varies a little bit by business. Light commercial has come down, but it's still above normal. It looks like resi is getting closer to normal. It's closer, kind of Patrick said in that four to six range -- four to six-week range would be normal. And starting to kind of approach those levels that we've seen in the past for resi. And commercial HVAC still has a very strong backlog. That would be above normal, and it almost varies by region. In places like Europe and China, it's a little bit closer, but higher than traditional backlog levels. But in the United States, we've had some operational challenges in our Charlotte facility, which the team is working very hard to address, has been making a lot of progress on some of the underlying issues. But until we get those fully in the box, we'll continue to see elevated backlog levels that go well beyond this year into next year. So, it's nice to have the backlog, but we still do need to make in that particular site more progress on the supply chain issue. So, in general, it's getting closer to traditional levels, but it kind of varies by region, by business, and it varies a little bit based on our supply chain overall performance. What I will add, Joe, is that one thing that we're doing is doubling down on the basics. We brought in a new team to help with our [SIOP] (ph) processes, our sales inventory operations planning, because we're in an environment where there is some fluidity on the demand side, and we still have some longer lead times for things like chips. So, we need to have very agile demand and materials planning, so we can give our customers what they want and what they need when they need it and not get stuck in the middle with inventory levels, and that's been a whole focus area for us internally. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Dave, that makes sense. And I guess maybe just connecting the dots with the backlog. It was good to hear that backlog grew sequentially. It sounded like the commercial business had started to reaccelerate, but I don't want to put words in your mouth. So just maybe just talk to us a little bit about the order trajectory there and what you're seeing on the ground real time? David Gitlin : Yeah. I think that with respect to commercial, Patrick mentioned that -- I think, Joe, the question is about commercial HVAC? Joe Ritchie : Yeah. Just I would say commercial and applied more broadly. David Gitlin : Yeah. I think that -- look, it was nice to see over the past four weeks or so, we've seen that demand positives. You look at the commercial HVAC business, we still have, in some cases, as I mentioned in North America, for example, backlogs that go well above -- well beyond historical levels and that does have an effect on incoming orders. So, as those backlog levels will start to moderate, especially in North America, we do expect that the demand will continue to be there. You look at ABI, it was over 50, the Architectural Billing Index was over 50 in both May and June. It's been over 53 in the last four months. And I think when I look at the job that Gaurang and the team are doing, they've been very agile. We talk a lot about when you fish, you go where the fish are. When you go -- when you're in a business like ours, you go where the customers are. So, K-12 has been strong, healthy buildings. Industrial activity has been strong. Data centers continues to be positive. Healthcare is positive. And then, we transition away from some of the areas which show some areas of weakness. So, commercial and residential real estate in parts of China were weak. We pivoted hard to industrial infrastructure, and that's been driving a lot of demand. So, we feel good about the backlog, and it's nice to see the order rates over the last month or so. Joe Ritchie : Great. Thanks, Dave. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. David Gitlin : Hey, Josh. Patrick Goris : Good morning, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Dave, I wanted to just pick your brain a little bit on follow-up to that last question. What's your sense on non-residential construction? I think, some of the data is getting worked around by the mega projects, which I think maybe the HVAC content is a little harder to tease out. Obviously, things like warehouse that are declining, but maybe not as important. So, what's your sense on that market now? The data seems like it's good. You've talked more about backlog normalization and real demand shifts. But are you seeing anything on the ground level there? David Gitlin : Well, yeah, I think that, clearly, we've seen the areas that have been a bit weaker, it's some areas of retail. But, interestingly, some of the lower end retail has been positive. So not all retail, but some areas of retail in our applied business and areas of commercial real estate have been weaker. And that's -- and you know this Josh, but remember that commercial real estate is less than 10% of our North American applied business. So, we watch it. We watch some of the reaction that we were going to see with the regional banks. But there's been nothing terribly acute. And, I think, on the flip side, some of the areas that continue to be very positive is K-12. I mean, we still have a significant amount of that extra funding to be spent. Higher ed has been extremely strong. And then you look at industrials, chipset, bringing some new construction back to the United States, and that space has been positive. Data center is good, healthcare good. So, we look at it globally. I think, in general, the theme is around real estate is a watch item. I will tell you on the flip side, it's encouraging. That ABI is about a six-month leading indicator for new order activity. So, to see ABI showing some growth, it could indicate that folks see an eventual moderating of rates, which should drive some new construction activity on the real estate side six months out. So, we'll have to watch and see if that happens. But in the meantime, some of the other verticals have been strong. And, as you mentioned, warehouse has been a bit on the weaker side, I would say. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. Very comprehensive. And then just a follow-up, and if someone asked it already, I missed it, I apologize. Heat pumps in IRA, something was obviously very topical, kind of six, nine months ago and it's maybe gotten a little less attention lately. It seems like the heat pump market in general has been strong, but what's your sense on the IRA uptake? And maybe any kind of tighter quantification of what you think that might be worth over the next, I don't know, 12, 18 months? David Gitlin : It's hard to exactly dimensionalize it. But I will say what happened is the legislation got passed, and then we went into a bit of a low period while that was actually getting effectuated. And in some cases, you're dealing with not only the IRS, but a state-by-state implementation. So, I think, that I would call like 2023 the year of things getting codified. 2024 is going to be the year where we start to really see the benefit of it. And I think it's going to kick in really in the first quarter of '24, and we're very pleased with how it's gotten codified overall, which has been that the $2,000 incentive for heat pumps in the United States getting applied to that mid-tier level, which was very important to see the kind of take rate that you would want to see to have the impact you would want on consumers, but also on the planet. There still is one area where how they define some of the levels for heat pumps in the North and the South. There's a variance there. We'd like the definition that we're seeing in the South applied equally to the North, because in the background we're working on the technology for cold weather heat pumps. So, there's still some, I think, improvement to be made in the legislation for the northern part of the country. But I expect we'll start to see, I think, a tangible benefit as we get into 2024. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Helpful update. Thanks a lot. David Gitlin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks. I just wanted to get maybe a deeper update on the regulatory approval process for Easton. You mentioned on track to close by year-end. But maybe just take us through where the regulatory approval key steps are at? And any potential for slippage around those timelines? David Gitlin : Well, it's been progressing very well. Hats off to the team, because we got the FDI approval in Germany. We've gotten various country approvals as we've been going along, such as China, that was positive to see. And I think the Q1 that we'll be down to is in the European Union, and that's frankly progressing very well, and it's progressing well because there's really no material overlap between us and them. So, we said that we would close around year-end, and we remain on track for that. Noah Kaye : Okay. Great. Switching to different topic, aftermarket and services. Aftermarket another double-digit quarter. Services sales up 16%. And, Dave, you mentioned in the prepared remarks around embedding generative AI and Abound in the digital platform. And I was wondering if you could maybe help tie together for us some of those investments and the sales traction you're seeing. How does AI and generative AI actually help increase penetration of digital and aftermarket? David Gitlin : Well, we've -- working with Bobby George and the digital team, we're establishing an AI, generative AI center of excellence as a skill set. Look, we've been using it for a while. There are some areas where it's a bit more basic like in our call centers, where we can drive much more efficiency and responsiveness for our end customers, in our call centers using generative AI, and that's very encouraging. And, I think, in the area of things like our digital platforms Abound and Lynx, what you're really looking at is capturing data and using that data to make -- using algorithms to anticipate issues before they occur, that can then affect the controls and ultimately drive automation. And that, as we build out all of the applications and capabilities around Abound and Lynx, the fundamental capabilities around generative AI are going to be very significant. We've been at this for many years. We're now taking it to a new level, because of some of the advances we're seeing in the AI capabilities, where you start to anticipate a failure of equipment before it occurs, because you're looking at certain physics-based algorithms associated with the temperature, pressure and other aspects of the equipment. You start to look -- use Lynx to use geo-fencing and other capabilities that go beyond temperature controls and prognostics and diagnostics on the cold chain side. So, it's very exciting. It's yet another distinguishing feature we can add to our digital platforms. Noah Kaye : That's really interesting. Thanks for the color. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open. Stephen Volkmann : Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here. Just a couple of questions, maybe a little bit longer term. But I'm trying to think about -- or how you think about pricing in 2024, 2025? Do we kind of go back to the historical norm, do you think? Or is there a reason it might stay a little bit higher? And is there any reason that mix wouldn't continue to improve as we go a little bit longer term? David Gitlin : Well, look, I think that I do see pricing continuing, but being more at historical levels. I mean you have to keep in mind that you look at pricing over the last couple of years. We were dealing with, I think, close to a couple of billion dollars of price over the last two years, and we're going to continue to see, I think, Patrick said around $600 million of price this year. So, I think, that we will be in the normal what we assume to more typical levels on price. We don't certainly see price reductions, but we see continued price increasing. But not at the kind of pace that, of course, we've seen over the last couple of years. Mix continues to be positive. We'll continue to see the 2023 benefits that we saw in the SEER change extend into next year on the residential light commercial side. We also see mix benefits on the Refrigeration side, the same transition that we're seeing on the HVAC side, we're seeing in places like United States and Europe as they transition to lower-emission diesel-powered truck and trailer units, but also a transition to electric. That mix up is very beneficial to the truck/trailer side as well. And then, as we get into the parts of 2024 that extended to 2025, in North America, we'll have the refrigerant change as well, which would be a further mix up. So, mix will continue to be positive on both -- on all aspects of the business, and then we'll resume normal pricing levels. But in the background, it's our job to drive productivity. So, we talked about 2% to 3% net productivity forever. The team is driving a few hundred million this year. And one of the things that our new Head of Operations, Adrian Button, and the team are doing very well is not only looking at productivity for 2023, but we have one source of the truth, one digital platform that everyone looks at every week, and we're using that digital tool to set ourselves up for 2024 productivity as well. So, we get really good line of sight going well beyond 12 months. Stephen Volkmann : Perfect. Okay. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up maybe for Patrick. How should we think about the cadence of TCC as we get into '24? Is it still margin dilutive? Patrick Goris : Well, the key reason why this year is margin dilutive is instead of recording equity income as we did prior to the acquisition, now we're consolidating the entire P&L. So, this year, I mentioned that their operating margin would be -- it's already at the double-digit level, so a little bit lower than the company average. I would expect that to continue to improve. And next year, it might not yet be at the overall company average, but I would expect to get significantly closer to it. But the main reason why it is dilutive this year is because we basically consolidate $2 billion of revenue with $100-million-plus-ish of incremental operating profit. That's the dilutive impact. Stephen Volkmann : Perfect. Thank you, guys. David Gitlin : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Your line is open. Vlad Bystricky : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my call. David Gitlin : Hey, Vlad. Vlad Bystricky : Hey. So, I just wanted to ask about the uptick in China orders in the quarter. I know a year ago, comps got easier. But China is one market, I think, we're just trying to understand a little better what the trends are in there. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of underlying demand trends in China? And how you're thinking about the potential to maintain positive orders momentum there going forward over the next couple of quarters? David Gitlin : Yeah. Vlad, I got back recently from China, and just to level set, it's about 9% of our total sales. And our overall outlook in China is promising. We see it up double digits for us this year. The comps are a bit easier, but we still do see underlying growth. The first half was up just over 20%. Now, Q2 had some easy compares, because remember there were the COVID lockdowns in Q2 of last year and Q2 was up 30% or so for us in China. But when we look, overall, we see growth in applied in China, especially on the industrial side. The industrial verticals were up over 20% in the first half. And it was verticals like the renewable energy, medical pharma was strong, and that helped -- that's been helping us to offset some of the weakness that we saw in the commercial real estate side. And, by the way, I think, I might have said that -- the first half was just under 20%, not over 20%, but it was kind of in that range. And the other thing I'll say about our teams in China, and this applies to commercial HVAC, it applies to the residential light commercial side, that's part of our GCS business, our Fire & Security and resi side, is we've seen the key to success is being very agile. That's true globally. But I think it's true, especially in China. If you look at where we are at commercial HVAC, just five years ago, our mix was 70% property, 30% industrial. It's now 40/60, the reverse. So, we've been very, very purposeful about shifting our sales folks, our sales incentives to go after where we see the growth, which has been extremely strong with some of our partners over there in that I&I space. And I do believe the government will continue to incentivize further growth there. So, we -- overall, it's not going to be a straight line. But, overall, we remain bullish on China. Vlad Bystricky : Okay. Great. That's really helpful, Dave. And then just as my follow-up, maybe shifting to North America. I know you mentioned, and you've seen obviously good strength in the K-12 vertical. One question or concern that we hear from some investors is around potentially peak-ish spending in that K-12 market, just given the strength we've seen there. So, can you talk about how you're thinking about growth runway in the K-12 vertical broadly going forward? And whether you are seeing any signs of sort of increased budget constraints in -- from those customers? David Gitlin : Yeah. I actually -- I view it the opposite of that. I think there's tremendous runway on K-12. I remember that this is the first time in decades where the K-12 area has had dedicated and sufficient funding. And they've allocated -- the federal government had allocated $190 billion of ESSER funding or $290 billion -- there's $190 billion in the ESSER fund over the next 15 months, and $90 billion of that has still yet to be allocated. So, $90 billion of the $190 billion still has to be allocated over the coming 15 months. Now, whether or not that's physically possible remains to be seen, and whether or not there will be an extension of that remains to be seen. I would suspect there needs to be. But, in the meantime, there is actually more runway ahead than there has been growth in the past. I mean, we continue to see -- orders have been up double digits for a long time. We saw K-12 orders up 20%, as I mentioned, in the quarter. Our pipeline in Q2 is now up 60% over where it had been. So, we think it's a very attractive vertical. And the way that funding gets spent is some of the initial funding is the lower lead time, less expensive-type projects. As you get into ESSER III funding, and there's still $120 billion of the $190 billion is an ESSER III, that's when you get into things that have to do more with like HVAC. So, we think there's a lot of runway ahead in K-12 in the U.S. Vlad Bystricky : I appreciate the color, guys. Thanks. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks. David Gitlin : Well, look, my thanks to the 55,000 team members at Carrier. We have a lot of moving parts in the system. The team continues to work tirelessly on behalf of our customers and achieve great results. So, my thanks to everyone at Carrier and our thanks to our investors. And, of course, Sam will be available for questions as we go through the day. So, thank you all. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. The company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Once the call is open for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to give everyone the opportunity to participate. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I am very proud of our team for delivering another strong quarter, enabling us to again increase our full year guidance. HVAC environment security sales were both up mid-single digits with the overall company delivering yet another quarter of double-digit aftermarket growth. Adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS were both up over 20% year-over-year with adjusted operating margins up 240 basis points in the quarter. The HVAC and Fire & Security segments both delivered record adjusted operating margins in the quarter, approximately 21% and 18%, respectively. Free cash flow performance also continues to be strong, positioning us for some upside for our full year guidance. Bottom line is we continue to perform while we transform, as you can see on Slide 3. We are a team that is very clear eyed about macro challenges. We are focused on controlling the controllables, driving operational excellence, being tenacious about customer centricity, out innovating our peers and consistently delivering on our commitments. With 2 months left in the year, we are confident that in 2023, we will deliver mid-single-digit organic growth, 15% adjusted EPS growth, margin expansion despite the negative impact from consolidating Toshiba Carrier and strong free cash flow.  Not only are we poised to close out 2023 on a strong note, we have significantly matured our productivity processes. So we will enter 2024 with even more rigor and detailed plans around our cost reduction activities positioning us for further margin expansion next year and beyond. We also have confidence in continued growth driven in part by our aftermarket and recurring revenue traction as you see on Slide 4. We're on track for 80,000 chillers under long-term agreements and 30,000 connected chillers by year-end. The attachment rate in Q3 was approximately 50%, nearly double pre-spin performance. Abound continues to gain market traction exemplified by new scale customers committing to our Abound Healthy Air Solution and Abound net zero management offerings in Q3. Additionally, we announced the launch of Lynx Logix, a new Software-as-a-Service application within our Lynx digital platform that helps predict and address supply chain disruption by automatically identifying trends, patterns and issues in distribution networks and transportation lines. Customers clearly see the benefit of Lynx capabilities, and we now have over 100,000 paid Lynx subscriptions. Our playbook around digitally enabled life cycle recurring sales continues to yield encouraging results globally as we are well positioned for another year of double-digit growth in 2023 and beyond. Our other major growth theme is around driving differentiated solutions to ensure sustainability leadership. You see examples of that on Slide 5. We continue to introduce industry-leading products into the market that help our customers achieve their sustainability targets while decarbonizing the planet for generations to come. Carrier Transicold introduced a new optimal line refrigerated container unit, which offers best-in-class energy efficiency versus the competition and is approximately 15% more fuel efficient than our prior units. We also introduced a comprehensive new line of high and very high temperature heat pumps for use in industrial, commercial and health care buildings as well as district heating. These key pumps reduced both carbon emissions and energy costs up to 80% versus traditional gas boiler applications. Additionally, our new Zero GWP refrigerant air to water high-efficiency heat pump will nicely complement Viessmann's offerings in the European market. And on top of these new product introductions, our existing business continues to gain momentum as European commercial heat pump sales were up 70% in Q3 and are up 40% year-to-date. Thanks to our sustainability product and service offerings, we are well on our way to achieving our Scope 3 commitment of reducing our customers' greenhouse gas emissions by more than one gigaton by 2030, having achieved approximately 270 million metric tonnes of reduction since 2020. We have and will continue to invest a disproportionate amount of our R&D in sustainability differentiation. We are pleased to have been recognized by Time Magazine, Newsweek and many others for our sustainability leadership. Excitingly, the combination with Viessmann Climate Solutions will further accelerate our mission of becoming the world leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions, as you see on Slide 6. Last month, we had the pleasure of hosting Max Viessmann, Chairman and CEO of the Viessmann Group, in our headquarters for a webcast event to discuss his views on the future combination, we are profoundly confident and excited in the value creation opportunities ahead of us. The trend towards heat pumps in Europe is unambiguous and will continue for many years to come. Max confirmed that European decarbonization is a trend that is not changing and is well supported by government in Europe. While individual countries may adjust regulations and subsidy levels from year-to-year, we see a multiyear growth opportunity as those countries meet their commitments for emission reductions backed by EU and country-specific funding. Residential heat pump penetration in Europe is only about 8%, and 21 countries have subsidies to support 2030 and 2050 decarbonization goals. Viessmann Climate Solutions is also well positioned for continued share gains. Unlike some of its competitors, it has the advantage of providing solutions for all energy classes, heat pumps, gas boilers, hydrogen boilers while some of its competitors are pure-play heat pump or boiler providers. It has a connected ecosystem of offerings for an electric home such as solar PV, batteries and a differentiated digital platform while also driving increased subscription sales. A good example is the Vitocal 250-A natural refrigerant air to water heat pump that won this year's award for the Best Heat Pump in Germany. Viessmann Climate Solution is soon introducing a 19 kilowatts of output version that will now give it access to over 90% of the single-family home heating market. Additionally, the brand-new Vitocal 250-A Pro also releasing in Q1, will offer heat pumps outputs of up to 40 kilowatts, ideal for multifamily and commercial buildings. And based on our experience with Toshiba Carrier and that acquisition and integration, which is going extremely well, we are certainly confident in the cost synergies and already see potential for revenue synergies, which go well beyond our deal model. In short, Viessmann Climate Solutions is the most attractive business in the most attractive segment in our space, and we cannot wait to come together as one business, which is likely to close the first week of January 2024. Lastly, a brief update on our business exits on Slide 7. First, my thanks to our teams who are working quite literally around the clock and doing a superb job. We have many advisers, who together with our bankers, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan on Fire & Security and Bank of America on Commercial Refrigeration, our focus on maximizing the net proceeds and speed while ensuring a clean exit of these businesses. We are progressing very well with the prospective buyers for security, commercial refrigeration and industrial buyers. The interest level has been extremely high, and we expect to be able to announce signed agreements before the end of 1Q, hopefully sooner. The capital market transactions for the combined commercial and residential fire business is on track. These are superb assets with deeply committed and effective team members, and we remain very optimistic about the value that we will realize on these exits. With that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8. Sales in the quarter were $5.7 billion with organic growth of 3%, a 1% tailwind from foreign currency translation and a 1% net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures. The latter was substantially all driven by one month of Toshiba Carrier before becoming organic at the beginning of August. Q3 adjusted operating profit of over $1 billion was up more than 20% compared to the prior year on 5% reported sales growth. Strong productivity and price cost helped us expand our adjusted operating margin by 240 basis points to 18.2%. That is despite a 30 basis point headwind related to the Toshiba Carrier consolidation. Reported earnings conversion was 65% in the quarter. Core earnings conversion that is excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency was far higher than that. Adjusted EPS of $0.89 is up 27% year-over-year and includes a tailwind from discrete tax items in the quarter. Free cash flow of about $950 million was up 35% compared to last year. Year-to-date, we have generated over $1.3 billion in free cash flow compared to about $400 million during the same period last year, reflecting improved working capital performance and higher earnings. Overall, a good quarter and better than we expected mainly as a result of better operating performance and the discrete tax items I mentioned earlier.  Please turn to Slide 9. Q3 was another good quarter for HVAC. Organic sales were up 4%, driven by high single-digit growth in commercial HVAC, 30% growth in light commercial and double-digit growth in aftermarket. North America residential HVAC sales were down low single digits in the quarter. Overall resi volume was down low double digits and revenues continued to benefit from price realization and positive mix from the 2023 year transition. Destocking is expected to continue in Q4, and we expect North America residential HVAC volumes to be down mid-teens for the full year. We expect field inventories to end 2023 also down mid-teens from the beginning of the year, which should position them at more appropriate levels heading into 2024. Offsetting lower expected residential volume in 2023, we now expect light commercial HVAC sales to be up about 30% versus about 20% in our prior guidance. Adjusted operating profit for the HVAC segment was up 33% compared to last year on 7% reported sales growth, driven by productivity and price costs. Adjusted operating margin reached a record high and was up 410 basis points compared to last year despite a 50 basis point headwind from the consolidation of Toshiba Carrier. You will see in the 10-Q later today that there was a onetime $60 million tax benefit from a joint venture that is included in equity income, so that was more than offset by other discrete items in the segment. In short, excellent financial performance of this segment in the quarter. Moving to Slide 10 for Refrigeration. Reported sales were flat in the quarter with organic sales down 3%, offset by a 3% benefit from foreign currency translation. Within transport refrigeration, global truck and trailer sales were up high single digits driven mostly by over 20% growth in European truck and trailer. Container continued to experience demand softness, however, and was down roughly 25% year-over-year. Commercial refrigeration sales were down about 10% in the quarter with orders for this business returned to year-over-year growth.  Looking ahead to Q4, we expect the container business, commercial refrigeration and the entire Refrigeration segment to return to organic sales growth. Adjusted operating margin for this segment was down 80 basis points compared to last year, mainly due to the lower volume in container and commercial refrigeration, which more than offset the benefits from productivity and price costs in this segment. Moving on to Fire & Security on Slide 11. Just like HVAC, this segment had good financial performance in the quarter. Reported sales were up 2%, with 6% organic sales growth and the 1% tailwind from foreign currency, partially offset by a 5% headwind from the KFI deconsolidation. Organic growth was broad-based with high single-digit growth in Industrial Fire & Security and mid-single-digit growth in commercial and residential fire combined. Adjusted operating profit was up 13% versus the prior year. Similar to HVAC, adjusted operating margins hit a record level and were up 170 basis points year-over-year, driven by volume, productivity and price costs.  Turning to Slide 12. Total company orders were down a little less than 10% in the quarter, mostly due to the declines in the shorter cycle businesses. Overall HVAC orders were down about 10% in the quarter with expected declines in residential and light commercial HVAC. Commercial HVAC orders were flat against a difficult comp. Last year, orders were up 15% to 20%, and the backlog remains robust, up over 40% on a 2-year stack and extends well into next year. Refrigeration orders were down approximately 15% to 20% in the quarter, largely driven by Transport. Very strong orders growth in international truck and trailer, up 60% year-over-year, was more than offset by over 50% order decline in North American truck and trailer. For North America truck and trailer, we opened the 2024 order book in Q2 of this year. For 2023, we opened the order book in Q3 of last year. On a year-to-date basis, North America truck and trailer orders are up low-single digits, which is probably more indicative of underlying demand. Commercial refrigeration and container orders in October give us confidence in the Refrigeration segment's returned to organic growth in Q4. Orders in Fire & Security were up around 5% with particularly strong growth in industrial fire. We believe that lead times for the majority of our shorter-cycle businesses across our 3 segments have normalized with backlogs close to more typical levels. Our longer-cycle backlog continues to grow year-over-year. Now moving on to guidance on Slide 13. We expect full year sales to come in around $22.1 billion to $22.2 billion, including mid-single-digits organic sales growth. We are raising our full year adjusted operating margin guidance to about 14.5%, driven by strong year-to-date performance. Within the segment, we are increasing our full year HVAC adjusted operating margin guidance to about 16.5% while maintaining our Fire & Security guidance at 15.5%. Refrigeration full year adjusted operating margin is impacted by lower volume in container and commercial refrigeration and as a result, will likely end up a little lower than 13%. We are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 compared to our prior midpoint to about $2.70. We have included a 2023 guide-to-guide adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix for your reference. In essence, improved operational performance drives about half the increase. The balance is mostly driven by a lower expected adjusted tax rate. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate is now expected to be between 21.5% and 22% compared to our prior guidance of about 23%. As for free cash flow, we now expect to generate slightly more than $1.9 billion in 2023.  Before I turn it back over to Dave, let me give you a couple of updates. You may recall that we will be funding the Viessmann acquisition through a combination of equity, cash on hand and debt. The latter will be a mix of term loans and long-term debt. We previously shared that we hedged the cash portion of the consideration against currency trend. In the third quarter, we entered into a number of interest rate marks to mitigate interest rate exposure on the expected issuance of debt with maturities 10 years and beyond. As a result, we do not expect a significant change in our cost of financing for Viessmann compared to our original business case. We expect to be in the market for the bond offerings in Q4 in advance of an early January close. As we communicated previously, we will be very focused on deleveraging post-acquisition, and we'll use free cash flow and proceeds from the business exits to do so. We continue to expect to return through share repurchases as soon as our net leverage returns to about 2x. One last topic. I'd like to share our current thoughts on how we will provide 2024 guidance in February, given the acquisition and the 4 business exits transaction. We currently expect that our 2024 guidance will include a full year of Viessmann Climate Solutions. The exact timing and the proceeds of the business exits are, of course, not known as of today. For context, there are specific rules that determine when a business can be treated as discontinued operations in the financial statements, and it is our current assessment that the Fire & Security businesses being exited will likely not qualify as disc ops for reporting purposes until all of these transactions have been executed. We do not expect commercial refrigeration to qualify for disc op. Therefore, we intend to provide guidance consistent with how actual results will be reported. This means that we will include the earnings of the businesses to be exited into our 2024 guidance. We will then adjust guidance as needed for the exact timing of the exits and the use of the proceeds. By the time we provide guidance in February, we expect to have a better sense of timing and proceeds with several of the business exits. With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Dave. David Gitlin : Well, thank you, Patrick. In closing, Carrier continues performing while transforming. We had another strong quarter. And more importantly, we again increased our outlook for 2023 with mid-single-digit organic growth, margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong free cash flow performance, all broadly in line with the value creation framework that we shared with you at our latest Investor Day. So with just a couple of months more to go in 2023, we are, of course, already looking ahead to 2024 with continued confidence in strong top and bottom line growth and cash conversion. With that, we'll open this up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : We're hearing some commentary about higher inventory in the channel of heat pumps in Europe just all coming from some of the uncertainty about when some of these government stimulus programs will be passed. What's your sense of channel inventory? And how does that play out? David Gitlin : Well, Deane, let me just first give you a little bit of color on just how Viessmann Climate Solutions business has been doing year-to-date. Look, their sales are up about 18% year-to-date. Heat pump sales were up over 35%. They've had strong margin expansion. They're still tracking to the financials that we had thought for this year. And when we look ahead, I could tell you that we are very confident in the overall earnings trajectory that we had put in our business case. Clearly, when you see governments adjust some of their regulations and subsidies from 1 year to another, you may see some impact on the adoption rate of heat pumps. I think what you'll see is what we all saw, which is backlogs got to very high levels. We saw it throughout our portfolio. I think every industrial company saw it, is that as we all face some of the supply chain issues, backlogs were elevated way beyond typical levels. I think that we'll see those backlog levels for Viessmann come back in line with what would have been historic levels. And I do think that when we look at countries like Germany and Italy, you will see some short-term movement in some of the order rates as those legislations play themselves out. But look, there's -- number one, there's no question in anyone's mind, you're going to see this continued transition to heat pumps overall in Europe. And it doesn't take minor swings in oil and gas prices to even accelerate that. Second, they could not be better positioned to outgrow the market. We've talked consistently about their channel, their technology, their brand and how differentiated they are. And especially when I mentioned in my prepared remarks about them introducing new products, which exposes them to a completely new part of the market that they weren't in before when these products come out in 1Q, and they have the advantage of having complete home energy management solutions. So -- and in the background, it wouldn't surprise you that we will push very hard to overdrive on top and bottom line synergies. And we've had a chance to spend a lot of time with Thomas, the leader of that business and his team. The more time we spend with them, the more excited we are and the more confident we are in the value proposition from that combination. Deane Dray : That's all really good to hear. And then second question, can you take us through some of the assumptions on what's going on in light commercial, up 30%? What are the drivers and visibility there, please? David Gitlin : Yes. Look, I mean, we -- sales were up 30%, as you mentioned, Deane, in the quarter. And I think when we look at the full year, we thought light commercial was going to be up 20%. I think for the full year, it's going to be up 30% as well. So when we look at it, there are some verticals that just remain extremely strong. K-12 orders were up 25% in the quarter. The pipeline there is even up 50% and we still see strong demand in some of the value-based retailers. There are some verticals that will be under some level of pressure, things like warehousing and some of things like higher-end restaurants and office space perhaps. But the overall underlying demand, especially in some of the key verticals, is strong and the backlog is still elevated. Normally, you'd have kind of 4 to 6 weeks backlog. And our backlog, as we sit here today, extends into the second quarter of next year. So we'll continue to watch inventory levels similar to what I said for Viessmann is that you did have demand that was and backlog beyond historic levels, those should normalize over time. We'll have to see as we get into next year. We're looking at the EPA ruling, which is data manufacturer with a 3-year grace period. So there will be, as we transition to 455, 454 be there as well. But overall, a great year for that team. And I think that we're pretty well positioned as we head into the first quarter of next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a first question around the North America residential HVAC market. So it looks like you're assuming perhaps that volumes there are down perhaps low double-digit, high single digit in the fourth quarter. I wanted to check if that's correct and how you're thinking about the slope of that getting back towards 0 next year. And also sort of when we think about next year, there's some discussion around the scope of the price effects tied to the refrigerants change, i.e., how much of your residential business might be affected by that change. Is it just the greenfield equipment? Or it's also the replacement equipment as well? And I'm assuming furnaces and parts are unaffected by that. Any color on that, please? David Gitlin : Sure, Julian. Let me start with kind of the year and then give a little bit of color on what we see for next year in light of this recent EPA ruling. I think for overall this year, we're looking at resi being down mid-single digits with volume being down in the mid-teens. That would imply overall sales in the fourth quarter down about mid-single digits for resi. And I think that this is the quarter of -- I think this is sort of the most -- the end of a lot of the destocking that we've been seeing. So we want to end this year with inventory levels down at least in the mid-teens versus where we ended last year. So our first priority is always being there for our customers, but we also want to be very purposeful in working with our channel partners on making sure that inventory levels going into '24 are at least down 15% versus where we ended 2022. I had the chance to be with about 100 of our key distributors on Tuesday in Dallas. We talked a lot about this and the regulatory changes. And I think we're all lock-stepped together to go in this year in a way that supports our customers and positions us for next year. I think when you look at the recent EPA ruling that's just come over -- come out over the last week, the good news is that the data of install ruling, what that's going to do is accelerate 454-B systems demand, and we'll likely see more 454-B sales in '24 than we previously thought, and that mix is favorable. And I will say that thanks to the great work of our team, we will technically and operationally be ready to cut in the 450-4B sooner and to ensure that we comply. We also think that our ability to manage the cutover can be a competitive advantage because we were already accelerating this in order to reduce risk. We are encouraged that the EPA did clarify their -- we are encouraging, I will say, the EPA to clarify their position. Because the way it's written, it would effectively allow dealers to replace the outdoor unit only with a 410-A replacement if it's not part of a system level change. And that could be interpreted as allowing 410-A sales indefinitely, and we don't think that was their intent. We've had a seat at the table with the administration, with the DOE, with the DPA, with bipartisan members of governors and the Hill, and we know what their intent is. And the way it's drafted, it's not consistent with the intent to transition to a more environmentally friendly refrigerant. Second, it will create a bit more complexity in the channel and supply chain. So we are encouraging them to clarify their position a bit. And I think and we'll see how that plays itself out. But regardless specifically to your question, Julian, what we said on pricing for 454-B stands. We said it would be up 15% to 20% over 2 years, in part because of our typical annual price increase, in part because of the extra cost associated with the system. I will tell you, keep in mind this year, we sort of break out price and mix. But if you combine those together for resi with the zero change, we'll be up 10% on price and mix combined. So when we look specifically at 410-A pricing, we will be raising price there as well, in part because of the increased carrying costs driven by the complexity of the ruling, but in part because that we will see a reduction of supply in the U.S. before 10-A. So we'll need to -- we'll have to deal with pricing to adjust for that. But we will also be looking at when we look at 410-A replacements for outdoor only, looking at treating that similar to how we would treat an aftermarket replacement, which would have limited warranty implications, and we're still evaluating that, but we will look at that. So net-net, EPA ruling more 54-B sooner is overall good, a bit more uncertainty as we navigate this with our partners, but I don't think there's going to be a company more prepared to deal and address with the switchover. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. And then just a quick sort of more financial question. The HVAC segment, I think, Patrick, you had mentioned some maybe temporary sort of headwinds and tailwinds moving around in that third quarter profit number. So maybe just a finer point on that. And I wanted to check that the guidance seems to embed a sort of low double-digit HVAC margin for Q4 and kind of sort of mid-20s operating leverage for the year whole inclusive of the Toshiba impact. Just wanted to check that those are sort of roughly the right thought processes. PatrickGoris: Yes. The answer to your last 2 questions, Julian, are yes on both counts. In terms of the HVAC margins, Sam pointed out that the transcript -- the life transcript said that I said that it's a $60 million tax benefit within JV income, within HVAC, it's $160 million, and that was offset by some discrete items that went the other way. But in summary, the large expansion of margins within HVAC, 410 bps year-over-year, despite the headwind from Toshiba Carrier consolidation, it's really driven by strong price cost and productivity. And that is the main driver that we see in that segment that also translates to the overall company. So some minor headwind to that. As I mentioned, acquisitions. We always invested with us a little bit there. But the main driver is productivity and price costs. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Patrick, thank you for the color on how you're thinking about the guide. I just want to get a little bit more into the deal, Matt, if we could. You're sitting on $3.9 billion in cash. I just wonder how much of that is sort of usable to consummate the deal versus cash that might be geographically stranded or other things? And I'm sure Viessmann is generating cash here. Does that go out the door to them as a closing adjustment? Or is that accessible to you to sort of self-fund the deal to some degree? And thirdly, just what are you looking at as kind of your blended funding cost based on the actions and locks that you took in Q3? David Gitlin : Yes. I'll start, Jeff, with the cash that we have. So we have $3.9 billion at the end of Q3. We expect that to grow further by the end of the year. You can think of about $1 billion of that generally is what we need to run the business would be, call it, not accessible, we wouldn't plan on using that. The remainder of the cash we would intend to use for the acquisition. So that's one. Two, with respect to cash at Viessmann. The type of acquisition we've done is a lockbox mechanism, which is typical for European deals. And in essence, it means that all these earnings and the cash generated within Viessmann as of January 1 of this year 2023 remains within Viessmann. And we get access to that the day we acquired them. And so we do expect at the time of closing to have access to that cash and to use some of that cash again to pay down some of the short-term -- the terminals we expect to use, for example, to fund the acquisition. The last question you had was, I think, was about the blended rate. And we assumed back in April a little bit of a conservative rate overall at about 6% to finance the transaction. And based on everything we know now, some of the locks we've put in place, we think we're very close to that number. It would also mean that our overall cost of debt, weighted cost of debt post the transaction would be right around 4% based on where interest rates are today. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. And just back to the earlier point, so there's a $116 million gain in HVAC segment results in the quarter, but that is fully or mostly offset by what exactly? PatrickGoris: Jeff, 1-6, $16 million tax gain within HVAC as equity income. That is all offset by some smaller other items. So $16 million. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Dave, can we maybe just talk a little bit about just the broader environment, the market is breaking out, given project financing concerns, higher rates environment, high rate environment, just what are your thoughts on all of the mega projects that have kind of moved forward. Ultimately, what needs for your business, whether you've started to see any of that or a substantial amount of that into your orders. Just any thoughts around that would be helpful. David Gitlin : Yes. Look, I think it was interesting. We saw ABI come out at 44% and exactly what you said, Joe, that there was -- that created a fair amount of anxiety, but there wasn't as much exuberance when it was over 50 for 3 of the last 5 months and it went through a stretch where it was over 50, I think, for almost a year straight. So I think, look, we take those metrics with, I think, a sober view, but a very look at the agility that we have as a team to pivot to where the strength is. So we look at certain verticals that remain just extremely strong, and we see that we still have in commercial HVAC extremely elevated backlog levels going into next year. And it's because that some of the orders we've seen in education, not only K-12 with the Ester funding, but also higher end, very strong data centers. We look at some areas of industrial, not only in the United States. But even though real estate remains under a lot of pressure in places like China, commercial real estate in the United States is under pressure, we see things like the Chips Act and we see things like some of the EV type spending we're seeing in China very strong, and we're winning more than our fair share of a lot of that new construction. And that's driven by some of the regulatory environment, decarb trends. So look, we take a very balanced view. I don't think a lot of people were thinking that light commercial would be up 30% this year, which it will be. I think going into next year, we'll go into next year, good backlog in commercial HVAC. We think that we're sort of bottoming them out in some of the resi space in the United States. We see aftermarket growth double digits. We've done a really nice job with the Abound and Lynx and the whole playbook around driving more recurring revenues to smooth some of the cycles, we've come a long way there. And then I think with some of our businesses like container, we went through a rough patch on container, which we fully expected, and we see that starting to recover here in 4Q going into next year. So I think we'll have a very balanced view. But we'll go into next year looking with good backlog in the longer-cycle businesses, and we still see orders trends in some of the key verticals that I think position us for solid growth next year. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's super helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up question, a more financial-oriented question on HVAC margins for 4Q. So Patrick, thanks for all the color. I think we've got. We're all set on the $16 million impact this quarter. But just for 4Q specifically. I know that it's always a much lower volume quarter for the business. But the change sequentially from 20% plus, call it, low double digits seems very substantial. Are there any other moving parts that we really need to take into consideration for 4Q versus the 3Q margins you just posted? PatrickGoris: The biggest element, and it's what I'm going to share is from an overall company perspective, but it's the same, of course, for HVAC, even the size of that segment. One, significantly lower sales sequentially due to the season that moves, of course, ready as well as some of the higher-margin businesses. In addition, you heard us talk about ensuring that field inventories are rightsized. So there is some downtime in some of our facilities as well to ensure that we start out 2024 with appropriate levels of inventory. And then we continue to make some investments and JV income is seasonally lower as well in the last quarter of the year as we see every year. I would say those are the biggest moving pieces, Joe. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : I want to follow up on the commercial commentary. So I look at the multi-quarter commercial orders trends, kind of flattish here. How do you think about 4Q orders trends in commercial just based off of everything you just described? David Gitlin : Well, look, last year, orders were up around low double digits. We'll have to see orders here in 4Q. It's too hard to tell just yet. But when you look at it, our backlog is up 40% on a 2-year stack. So I think that when we look at it by region, Europe has been almost surprisingly resilient. And we think about -- I mentioned that heat pumps up 70% in the quarter for commercial heat pumps. So we see continued strong demand in Europe, especially for heat pumps. North America we actually had much elevated lead time and backlog levels given a couple of operational issues that we had that are now significantly improving. The team's done a really nice job and making progress in some of our North American operational issues. So as that continues to improve and lead times eventually get back to more normal levels, we'll see orders start to increase there. And then China is kind of a mixed bag. China is under a little bit of pressure certainly on the real estate side. But as I mentioned, some of the infrastructure spend continues to be strong. We had a very recent win here for 6 chillers in China included a lot of our automated system. We're pushing very hard on aftermarket connected devices there. So we'll have to see. But I don't see a huge rebound here in China and 4Q. But hopefully, as we get into next year, things start to stabilize a bit there on the -- some key verticals. Noah Kaye : Okay. And then, David, I think there's been so much ink written about this. But since you're closely tracking the performance of the Viessmann business and given how well it's done year-to-date versus some of the headlines out there around heat pump demand. Just help us sort of reconcile the strength of the company's performance year-to-date and what they're doing now to position for all these different regulatory changes and what really drives your conviction that they'll continue to see sales growth and strong performance in '24 and beyond. David Gitlin : Look, there's so much to like there. I mean we've always known that as countries change regulation subsidy levels, that will have quarter-to-quarter impacts. We saw it in Italy last year that Italy had subsidy levels at 110% going back a couple of years and then they changed it to 90%, and that caused year-over-year headwinds in anxiety in Italy. That will smooth itself out over time. But if you're trying to predict what's going to happen as regulations change from 1 year to another, that will have some short-term swings. And I think that's what's being highlighted by some of Viesmmann peers. We're seeing in the German legislation that we do think that the regulation has written will go through. There's still a bit of a debate on the exact subsidy levels. Those subsidy levels will be debated, I think, November 6 and 7 in Germany levels. We expect those will all be promulgated and go into effect in January of next year. If you see an increase in subsidy levels, that will have a natural belling effect on orders as consumers wait for those increased subsidy levels to go into effect. So will that have an impact potentially on 1Q for 1 business from here to there? Of course, it will. But when we step back, we say, is the transition to heat pumps in Europe here to stay? We are 100% confident in that. Is Viessmann the best positioned company because they are not a pure play either heat pump or boiler company? Yes, because they have not only mixed factories, they have mixed lines. So as boilers, there's going to be more boilers next year than we had earlier anticipated, which I think there will be. They make great margins on boilers and they're able to swing their operational performance to support that. And then you look at all the other capabilities they bring to the table, when you combine with a world-class company, there are so many very obvious synergies and then a lot of hidden synergies as we apply their technology to our businesses across the world. And we bring in, say, for example, the Carrier brand into their channel, those are immediate revenue synergies that can offset like if there's some 1Q heat pump headwind in Germany, you can look at all these other things, whether it's additional solar PV battery cells, things like that, or revenue synergies. So we just feel so confident in the business, in the team, in the overall trajectory and the overall earnings profile of that business. Operator : Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Gautam Khanna : I wanted to ask in the resi business, are you guys seeing any evidence of trading down an increase in repair versus replace? We've heard some of the HVAC OEMs talk about that. I don't know if you've seen any evidence of that in the channel. David Gitlin : Interesting, Gautam. We have not. And I actually asked that question. We were -- I mentioned that a couple of days ago, I was with our top distributors. It's something that when economies soften that you naturally look for. But we have not seen that. We haven't seen the mixing down. We haven't seen the trading down, replacing parts instead of entire systems. So for us, what we're doing is, I think the team did a superb job in the switchover and the new SEER unit. We are now laser focused on positioning ourselves for the refrigerant change, which gives pricing some both price and mix benefits to offset some of the destocking that we saw throughout '23 that we'll see into -- into the fourth quarter. But then I think when we start next year, a lot of that will be behind us as we position ourselves for the 454-B switchover. So no, Gautam, we have not seen any material evidence of that. Gautam Khanna : Okay. Just a follow-up to an earlier question on the pricing alongside the new units coming out in '25 or perhaps '24, as you mentioned. Just curious, do you expect order of magnitude, the pricing on those units to be comparable to what you saw with the SEER change this year? Or do you think it's enough cost is going to be designed out of the system such that we're not going to get whatever it was, 10% to 15% pricing lift ultimately? I know that's kind of -- there's been some talk about that, but I'm just curious what's your best guess on kind of magnitude of pricing opportunity with that new unit. David Gitlin : Yes. I think, look, there's been some skeptics on the -- whether we see the 15% to 20% over 2 years. We're very confident in that. We are going to increase price in resi. The normal price that we would have done anyway. We will continue to do that. As we go into next year, and we'll do it again in early 2025 as well. And then on top of that, you are adding some cost to the system for things like leak detection and sensors and some parts of the controls, and it would only be natural for us to increase price based on some of the additional protections that we're adding to the 454-B units. So we came into this year expecting price and mix benefit. I think it will turn out to be even slightly higher than we thought, around 10%. And we expect to see kind of similar orders of magnitude on price mix benefit with the 454-B unit. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Brett Linzey : Yes. I just wanted to come back to the business exit update slide. You noted the resi commercial fire public trading late spring. Was hoping you could just put a finer point on what the nature and structure of that transaction might look like as it moves to the public markets? David Gitlin : Brett, it could take a few different forms. Look, it could be a spin. It could be a split. We -- the example there would be J&J can view that was in the market recently. So that's an example that we benchmarked. We're preparing for different scenarios. And look, we've talked about a clean exit. We've talked about accelerating buyback. We've talked about our commitment to our investors to pay down debt. And what we're doing with this public company exit is achieving, yes, all of the above. So we'll work on the specific form as we get into early next year. The prep is the same effectively either way. And I'm very proud of the team because normally, a lot of this work would take longer. But the team is heads down working around the clock so we can be ready for public trading in the late spring of next year. Brett Linzey : Okay. Yes, makes sense. And just to follow up on the international truck and trailer sales up over 20%, strong quarter. A bit of a moderation in the order book. What is your level of visibility based on backlog, based on incoming order rates as we flip the calendar here to '24? David Gitlin : Well, there's a couple of factors going on with international truck trailer. You also have a very rapid transition to electric going on there as well on truck. So I would tell you, we were pleasantly surprised with the low double-digit kind of increase -- the increase that we saw overall in international truck trailer. Orders were up 60% in the third quarter for our international truck trailer business, partly because of this transition to some of the electrification and partly because of the team has done very well in supporting the customers and the overall market demand. So we feel well positioned going into next year on the European truck trailer and even China has done well for us on the truck trailer side. And then North America truck trailer, despite people can sort of focus on some of the ACT numbers. But people said, look, 2023 ATP down mid-single digits for the year, our North American truck trailer will be up double digits. So we're taking a sober look at what ACT is saying for next year, but there's a lot of countervailing forces between, again, the shift to electrification, price, mix, and then this overall focus that we've had globally on length and more digitally enabled recurring revenues has yielded a lot of very strong results for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So I think you called out, I mean, we haven't explored this year, but the Toshiba performance, I think you called out, I think it's on Slide 4, I think it was maybe Slide 5 -- no, Slide 3. Toshiba Carrier performance remains strong. And we know Europe right now is really weak. We know that parts of APAC is really weak. So just curious what's driving the upside performance at Carrier, Toshiba Carrier? PatrickGoris: Nigel, the financial performance at Toshiba Carrier has been really strong. A lot of that is driven by the synergies. We mentioned, I think, last quarter that we're increasing the cost synergies from a target of $100 million run rate to $200 million. It is helping us significantly expand our margins in that business. To your point, the sales in Europe for that business were a little lighter for Global Comfort solutions. But the performance overall for that business is really strong. And the key driver there is really all the synergies that the team is driving. And we are nowhere near the actual run rate yet. And so we expect to benefit from that for the next couple of years as that expands. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's great. That's great to hear. And then I hate to go back to a question that's been asked a couple of times. But obviously, the HVAC margins this quarter were spectacularly strong when we even move back out the tax item. Obviously, 4Q, and I think 4Q originally was meant to be sort of similar to 1Q. It looks like it's coming in maybe a little bit weaker than 1Q. So just wondering, I'm assuming price costs would have been a factor in the HVAC strength there. I'm just wondering why that's not going forward to 4Q. So again, I mean, I know it's been answered, but maybe just a bit more color there, please? PatrickGoris: Yes. Actually, I think that the HVAC margins for Q4 will be very similar to our Q1 margins. So I think they're very much aligned there. And as I mentioned in one of my prior answers, what we're going to see in HVAC in Q4, as we address the field inventories, we mentioned in our comments, we want the field inventories to end about mid-teens down versus the beginning of the year, a lot of it is going to happen in Q4. So we're going to see more downtime in our factories than initially planned. And that's going to impact some of the margins, of course, in that segment. We do expect price cost and productivity generally remain strong, but that is a headwind that we wouldn't have seen in the prior quarter, which is a destocking headwind affecting our factories. Nigel Coe : Okay. And would there be some incentive spending to shift that inventory? Or is it just purely factory downtime? PatrickGoris: No, this is factory. There is no incentive. Operator : Our next question comes from Josef Nieto-Phillips with Jefferies. Steve Volkmann : It's actually Steve Volkmann here. We got a lot going on this morning, obviously, sorry about that. So my question is kind of a big picture one, Dave. Where do you think we are in the adjustment of the backlog? Does it go back to kind of historical levels? Or does it sort of settle in above historical levels? And sort of where are we in that process? David Gitlin : I think it goes back to historical levels. I think what happened over these last couple of years is just very unique that as you saw some of the supply chain challenges that -- and the underlying demand was strong. The consumer has been strong. You saw a lot of people getting in line to make sure that they had their orders positioned for when they need them. I mean, for example, light commercial. Light commercial for the school year, a lot of those replacements they want to see happen during the summer time. So people are making sure that with the supply chain uncertainty people are getting in the queue to have their position protected I think what you've now seen is in the shorter-cycle business, generally a return to more historic levels. With some of the longer cycle businesses like for us, commercial HVAC, we're still -- again, where backlog is up 40% on a 2-year stack. We're still elevated lead times and elevated backlog levels. I think that you would expect that to start to normalize. But if the underlying demand, which depending on the vertical remains strong, you'll continue to see very strong growth in some of those key businesses. So I think there will be a leveling. That's why we don't get overly fixated on quarter-to-quarter orders because they can swing wildly much more than they ever would have in the past. We talked about them being up 40% or down 40%. We don't swing with those. We look more at our backlog levels and our lead time to make sure that we see the strength that we expect to see. Steve Volkmann : Got it. And do you think we'll get sort of more normal by the end of '24? Or does it take longer than that? David Gitlin : No, I think that's about right. I mean I think that some of the shorter-cycle stuff is starting together. We're seeing more normal lead times in resi. I think that's going to happen for Viessmann Climate Solutions, that they'll start to get their backlogs back to more normal levels as you get into like the 1Q type timeframe. And then it just goes back to basics. So I think when you look at sort of the longer cycle stuff that's sort of by the end of '24, the shorter-cycle stuff is essentially there. Steve Volkmann : Super. And then Patrick, as this happens, is there a chance to generate net income or free cash flow above net income for another year? PatrickGoris: If we -- it will -- of course, it will depend on what's happening with our working capital. And I think so far this year, we've done really well compared to the, obviously, compared to last year generally a whole lot more. We would have to make a significant additional dent into working capital. Clearly, that's our objective, but obviously not ready to commit to that before February when we provide guidance for next year. Operator : And our last question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : I really appreciate you guys fitting me in. Just a question on light commercial and just business mix, right? Because the growth in light commercial has been so spectacular. It's a good margin business, and then in the face of resi declines and sort of stadia growth in Applied. As you look at North America, what does the business look like right now, sort of the mix between resi light commercial and applied? And how structural and sustainable is this mix going forward? Because clearly, it's quite good for your margins. David Gitlin : Well, look, the -- obviously, resi's far bigger business than light commercial. And to your point, Andrew, light commercial has been, I know, far better than many thought that we're modeling it coming into the year, and we've been very pleased with the performance there. So resi is the biggest business, followed by commercial, followed by Light commercial. We think with some of the destocking that we'll see in 4Q, we're kind of in the switchover to 454-B in resi. We think there, we know volumes down mid-teens, sales down kind of mid-single digits for resi. We start to see recovery as we go into next year in that business. Light commercial is going to face some tough compares. But as I mentioned, a lot of those verticals remain very strong in light commercial. And they're also doing what the rest of the business is doing is very much leaning into connected devices and the aftermarket opportunity. And frankly, it's a bit nascent in that space, and we think there's a lot of opportunity there. And then I think commercial, we still are dealing with very significant backlog in the commercial side. The controls business has done extremely well. Aftermarket is doing very well, double digits there and with further growth there. So we think that with the strong backlog, we think eventually, lead times will kind of come back to normal for the North American commercial business. But they're still elevated, still strong backlog. So they're positioned for growth as we get into next year as well. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question on commercial. Are you guys seeing the impact from mega projects? Because my understanding is that these semiconductor fabs, ABE factories require a lot of air conditioning, HVAC data centers. Can you just talk about what you're seeing about growth and visibility in these high-growth verticals on the commercial side? David Gitlin : Yes, Andrew, that's been very encouraging. We've done very, very well on many of the mega factories, and that includes both data centers. It includes factories associated with the Chips Act and some of the new construction activity there with all the Gen AI type activities. So we have solutions not only that we're doing more creative solutions with the high temperature and very high temperature heat pumps we mentioned. We've introduced new offerings like our mag bearing design for the Applied. We have a business that we bought a couple of years back called Nlyte that really complements our ALC controls business so we can provide sort of holistic controls to identify with specificity, where is the heat getting generated in a data center and how we dissipate that heat most efficiently. It's effectively an integrated AI tool in and of itself. So we love to see the continued construction with these mega projects, and we've gotten more than our fair share of new wins there. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks. David Gitlin : Well, look, let me just thank all of you, our investors, for their continued confidence, and let me thank our team. We have folks working tirelessly while we perform and continue to transform the business. So my hats off and thanks to the team. It's just not only working so hard, but working so well and together as a team. And with that, we'll conclude the call. And of course, Sam will be available for the rest of the day to everyone. Thank you all. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Carrier Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. The company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Once the call is open for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to give everyone the opportunity to participate. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Well, thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying a heartfelt thank you to our team for delivering excellent results in 2023, while navigating such a significant and compelling portfolio transformation. I'd also like to thank and welcome our new 12,000 team members from Viessmann Climate Solutions. Our formal kick-off last month had more energy, warmth, and excitement than I have ever seen from day one celebrations. I profoundly believe that this will go down as the most impactful business combination that our industry has ever seen, and we are so excited to be on this journey together. As you can see on Slide 2, the fourth quarter capped a strong finish to a great year for Carrier. In the quarter we achieved 33% of adjusted EPS growth, driving another quarter of double-digit aftermarket growth and 80 basis points of margin expansion on flattish sales. Importantly, free cash flow of over $800 million significantly beat our expectations, driven by continued strong performance and working capital. Overall for 2023, I am so proud of what the team accomplished, as you can see on Slide 3. Our team has consistently shown an ability to outperform without excuses, overcoming COVID headwinds to deliver strong results following our spin in 2020, persevering through supply chain challenges, and delivering for our customers and shareholders despite significant portfolio moves. For the year, we delivered 17% EPS growth and 3% organic sales growth, drove about 40% core earnings conversion, improved our free cash flow performance by more than 50% year-over-year, from $1.4 billion to over $2.1 billion. Not only did we deliver strong results in the year, we also took key actions on growth initiatives and detailed productivity planning to position 2024 for solid growth and margin expansion. This consistent performance has led to differentiated shareholder returns since we became a public company, as you can see on Slide 4. As we prepare for our spin, our goal was to leverage our many strengths that Carrier established over the past century, but also take advantage of the unique opportunity to create a new Carrier. We established a performance culture with innovation and customer intimacy at our core and simplified our business and portfolio. We have been disciplined on continuous improvement in productivity, invested in growth, and have driven recurring revenues with a proven playbook. We sharpened our focus as an organization to lean into the long-term trends around sustainability and have accelerated our leadership in this space. Though we're proud of our track record, we're even more excited about our next chapter as we take our performance to the next level. Our mission is clear, to be the global leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions, as you can see on Slide 5. It starts with differentiated product introductions, some of which you see listed here. We are now focusing our 6,000 engineers on developing differentiated sustainable solutions for our customers. Specific technologies that cut across our portfolio, across the globe, such as AI and sensing algorithms, low GWP refrigerants, energy efficiency, low temperature heat pumps, electrification, and integrated energy management solutions. We are poised to out innovate and win and we will continue to invest to ensure that we do so. These efforts are reflected in our results as we gain share across our portfolio. European commercial heat pump sales were up 25% in 2023. Nearly 40% of our North America residential split systems were heat pumps, and our market-leading electric transport refrigeration sales in Europe grew over 70%. For sustainability leadership, we walk the talk. We have reduced our customers' emissions by more than 270 million metric tons on our way to our 1 gigaton Scope 3 commitment for 2030. We remain on track for carbon neutrality in our operations by 2030 and are using a bound across our footprint to help ensure that we achieve it. We also laid out a clear roadmap to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain by 2050 under the SBTI framework. In addition to sustainability, one of our other key themes is achieving consistent double digit aftermarket growth which we achieved again last year as you can see on Slide 6. Growing 12% last year represents our third consecutive year of double digit growth. We now have approximately 30,000 connected chillers in the field versus 5,000 just three years ago. This has helped our attachment and our coverage rates with a commercial HVAC now at 45% attachment for long term service agreement up from roughly 20% just three years ago. We know the playbook, it's working, and we are targeting another year of double-digit aftermarket growth this year and beyond. In summary, we continue to perform while we are transforming, as you see on Slide 7. I already mentioned the energy and warm reception that we receive from our new team members and many customers across Europe just a few weeks ago. Here is what is clear. Viessmann is an organization with a deep culture of excellence. Excellence in its product design, customer intimacy, channel superiority, culture, team, all reflected in its deeply admired brand. The tangible and intangible benefits from this combination will benefit our people, customers, investors, and the planet for decades to come. We are also fortunate to now have Max Viessmann on our board, who is already providing us with unique insights and perspectives. When we look closer at 2024 we are planning for Viessmann Climate Solution sales to be up mid-single digits off a 2023 year end of about $4.2 billion, with high teens adjusted EBITDA margins. This includes the benefit of our targeted first-year cost synergies. Internally, we are targeting significant revenue synergies, which would all be upside to our business case. Even though last year's regulatory and subsidy uncertainty in some European countries delayed order intake, which we expect to impact growth in the first half of 2024, we do expect Viessmann Climate Solutions to return to solid growth in the second half of this year. And we target achieving or exceeding our year one business case adjusted EBITDA by accelerating supply chain and other cost savings. So we are off and running. We are applying the playbook from our successful integration with Toshiba to ensure that we preserve Viessmann\u2019s super team and culture while integrating to create tremendous value together. Turning to our business exits on Slide 8. You all saw our announcements on Access Solutions and Commercial Refrigeration which together will yield close to $6 billion or about $4.5 billion in net proceeds. We are making good progress on our Industrial Fire sale and still expect to announce a definitive agreement around the end of the first quarter. We are also preparing to exit our combined residential and commercial fire businesses via a sale or public market exit. Given our cash performance and the progress of these business exits we now have a path to achieve about 2 times net leverage ratio by the end of this year, which was about a year earlier than we previously indicated. Before I turn it over to Patrick, a quick word on our 2024 guidance on Slide 9. Even though GDP in many of our key markets looks to be less than 2%, we are planning for mid-single digit growth. Sustainability mega trends and continued double digit aftermarket growth enable us to significantly outgrow global economies. We will continue to be tenacious and disciplined on every aspect of productivity, and we are therefore targeting over 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. With that, let me turn this over to Patrick. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave, and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 10. Q4 earnings were ahead of our expectations and the guide we provided in October, even though reported sales of $5.1 billion were about a $150 million lower. Organic sales were flat and a favourable 1% tailwind from currency translation was offset by the impact of the divestitures. Organic sales were lower than we expected, mostly in the North America residential HVAC business as lower volumes reflected demand and distributors drove down field inventories. Q4 adjusted operating profit was up 8% compared to last year, despite flat sales, driven by favorable price cost and productivity, partially offset by investments. As a result, adjusted operating margin expanded by 80 basis points compared to last year. Adjusted EPS of $0.53 was up 33% year-over-year and was ahead of our implied Q4 guide of $0.50. Compared to our expectations HVAC margins were little better, fire and security and refrigeration margins were little light and we benefited from discreet tax items and somewhat lower net interest expense. Free cash flow of $829 million was about $150 million better than our October guide and we generated $2.1 billion of free cash flow for the full year, which is 92% of adjusted net income. Excluding some of the M&A related fees and cash restructuring spend which are adjusted out of our results we converted over 100% of adjusted net into free cash flow in 2023. Moving on to the segments starting on Slide 11. The HVAC segment had another good quarter with significant operating margin expansion despite flat sales. Organic sales were down 1%, mostly due to North American residential HVAC sales being down high teens. This headwind was almost completely offset by continued exceptional growth in light commercial HVAC, high single digit growth in commercial HVAC, including over 20% growth in the Americas and another quarter of double-digit growth in aftermarket. North America residential HVAC volume was down in the high 20s, which was partially offset by continued price realization and a positive mix-up related to the 2023 SEER transition. Our light commercial HVAC business finished a very strong year with another quarter of about 20% year-over-year growth. This business was up 35% for the full year, an industry best. Adjusted operating margin was up 250 basis points year-over-year on flattish sales growth, driven by price cost and productivity. This led to a full year operating margin for this segment of 16.6%. Overall, another great year for our HVAC business. Transitioning to Refrigeration on Slide 12. As expected, organic sales for this segment returned to growth in the quarter and were up 6%. Within transport refrigeration, container was up significantly, around 60%. Our global truck and trailer business was up low single digits with North America and Europe flat and strong growth in Asia. Our Sensitech business, which provides comprehensive visibility solutions for tracking and monitoring temperature sensitive products was up high single digits. Commercial refrigeration was down high single digits year-over-year. Operating margin contracted 160 basis points year-over-year due to investments and a few one-time items such as warranty and insurance. Moving on to fire and security on Slide 13. Organic sales were down given a very tough compare in Access Solutions, partially offset by strength in industrial fire, which was up almost 20%. Adjusted operating profit was down 7% versus the prior year, driven by volume mix and currency, partially offset by favorable price cost. The revaluation of the Argentinian peso impacted margins by over 100 basis points. Full year operating margin for this segment was about 15%. Turning to Slide 14. As you can see on the left side of the chart, backlog for our longer cycle commercial HVAC business continues to increase, while backlogs in our shorter cycle businesses continue to normalize. Total company orders were down low single digits in the quarter mostly as a result of our North America truck and trailer orders being down significantly compared to last year. In Q4 of 2022 North America truck and trailer orders were up an exceptional 120% year-over-year as we opened the 2023 order book. Excluding North America truck and trailer, Carrier\u2019s organic orders were up mid-single digits in Q4. HVAC orders returned to low single digit growth as residential HVAC orders were up mid-teens, which more than offset the decline in light commercial orders, which were down roughly 40% as lead times continued to improve in that business. Commercial HVAC orders were up low single digits and the longer cycle backlog remained strong, up around 30% on a two year stack and extending well into the second half of 2024. Refrigeration orders were down about 20% in the quarter with global truck and trailer orders down roughly 50% reflecting the very tough comp in North America I mentioned earlier. This was only partially offset by a return to growth in orders in a container business where orders were up nearly 60% and low single-digit growth in commercial refrigeration. Overall, we enter 2024 with robust, longer cycle backlogs in commercial HVAC and a return to orders growth in key businesses such as residential HVAC and container. Moving on to Slide 15, guidance. Let me start with some key assumptions embedded in guidance related to our portfolio transformation. We have included a full year of Viessmann Climate Solutions as we closed the acquisition on January 2nd. You may recall that we previously communicated that our business exits will remain in continuing operations until they close. Therefore, with definitive agreements in place for the sale of both global access solutions and commercial refrigeration, our guidance assumes a midyear exit date and so both businesses are included in 2024 guidance through the end of June. Accordingly, our guidance assumes the net proceeds from these two exits will be used to pay down debt. We include industrial fire and residential and commercial fire for the full year 2024 into our guidance and we will do so until there are definitive agreements in place and we have a good estimate as to the likely exit date. Now to details of the 2024 guidance. We expect reported sales of about $26.5 billion, including mid-single-digit organic sales growth, with about equal contribution from price and volume mix. We expect mid-single-digit organic growth for Viessmann Climate Solutions to contribute about 20% to reported sales growth and a deconsolidation of KFI along with the divestitures of Global Access Solutions and Commercial Refrigeration to represent about a 5% headwind to reported sales. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be between 15% and 15.5%, up over 50 basis points compared to 2023, driven by price, volume, and productivity. Productivity includes an $80 million benefit from restructuring actions we executed earlier this quarter as we simplify our structure, given our transformation. The impact of Viessmann Climate Solutions and overall company operating margin is about neutral. Core earnings conversion, that is excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FX is over 30%. Incorporating an estimated 23% adjusted effective tax rate, this gets us to an adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.80 to $2.90, which includes about a seven-set headwind from the Viessmann acquisition as we expected. Underlying free cash flow is expected to be up about 10% compared to 2023. Reported free cash flow will be lower given some of the portfolio transformation activities. Similar to 2022, when we exited Chubb, cash flow from operations will be impacted by tax payments related to the gains on the sales of these business exits. Given the large expected gains on the two transactions already announced, we expect free cash flow to net about $700 million. This includes about $1.7 billion of cash outflows related to the expected tax payments on the gains of Access Solutions and Commercial Refrigeration, transaction fees related to all four exits and the Viessmann transaction and additional restructuring. Similar to 2023, we expect higher than typical restructuring charges in 2024, about $100 million pre-tax. Seasonally, we expect our free cash flow to be back half-weighted. Unlike the tax payments on the gain of the business exits, proceeds from the divestitures will show in the cash flow statement as investing activities and therefore do not impact free cash flow. As shown on the right side of the slide, we expect mid-single digit organic growth in all three segments. Fire and security operating margin of about 14% reflects the absence of the higher margin global access solutions business in the second half of the year. Now moving to Slide 16, 2024 adjusted EPS bridge. This chart shows how adjusted EPS increases from $2.73 to $2.85 at the midpoint. Our guidance includes the benefit of volume leverage and strong productivity, leading to over 30% core earnings conversion and over 50 bips of margin expansion. Think of the dark blue as our core business, representing all the businesses we will retain, and the lighter blue representing the four businesses we are exiting. We expect the earnings of our core business to be up close to 15% in 2024, despite the dilutive impact of Viessmann. You can see the net contribution from Viessmann Climate Solutions and the net impact of losing six months of earnings from Access Solutions and Commercial Refrigeration offset by interest savings from the proceeds. We expect a headwind from tax as we return to a 23% adjusted effective tax rate. On the far right, you see that our full year 2024 guide includes about $0.30 of adjusted EPS related to businesses being exited. The $0.30, of course, does not reflect the benefit of the redeployment of expected net proceeds from the exits of industrial fire and residential and commercial fire. As usual, we provide estimates of other items in the appendix on Slide 20. With respect to capital deployment in 2024, we recently announced a dividend increase payable starting with the February dividend, and our focus this year will be on deleveraging through free cash flow generation and net proceeds from the exits. As we return to about 2 times net leverage, we do intend to resume share repurchases. Finally, before I turn it over to Dave, let me provide some additional color on the first quarter. We expect low single-digit organic revenue growth with about 50 bips of margin expansion. We have a $0.10 year-over-year adjusted EPS headwind, including $0.06 from Viessmann, $0.02 from last year's gain on the sale and refrigeration, and $0.01 penny each from the KFI deconsolidation and a higher tax rate. We therefore expect Q1 revenues of a little less than $6.5 billion and adjusted EPS to be right at about, but not above $0.50. We do expect organic revenue growth sequentially improve throughout the year with easier comparisons in the second half of 2024. We expect a little less than 50% of full year adjusted EPS to be realized in the first half of the year and the balance in the second half. With that, I'll turn it back over to Dave. David Gitlin : Thanks, Patrick. In closing, we delivered strong results in 2023 and are geared up to do so again in 2024. This is a big year for us as a company, and we will remain heads down, focused on execution, and we will start realizing the tremendous benefits that we'll see from the combination of Viessmann and as a sustainability focused, higher growth, pure play company. In 2024, we will continue to perform while we transform. With that, we'll open this up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, good morning. Dave, can you address just in a little bit more kind of color and detail how you see things playing out in Viessmann through the year. Obviously, the German political chaos and uncertainty on the incentives are clearly in play and impacted the end of the year in 2023. So just a little bit more color on what you're expecting in Germany, in particular, how you might offset that in other countries? And just how do we get comfortable with the business cycling higher in the back half of 2024? David Gitlin : Well, Jeff, we feel well positioned as we look at January, February, and then we do need to see that order book increase as we go into March, heading into 2Q. What we did see is exactly what you just said. Some of the dithering that we saw around legislation in countries like Germany and elsewhere did put a slight pause on new orders for a period of stretch in 3Q heading into 4Q. We now have clarity. We see the regulation coming out of the European Union, which is now looking like they're going to add a new provision that talks about not only getting to 55% renewables and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, but now 90% by 2040. You can't get there without more regulation around heat pumps. So, we got more definitive legislation in Germany in January, which has those subsidies in the 40% to 70% range, depending on a variety of factors. We have more certainty in countries like France and Italy. We have a new administration in Poland, which should unleash some of the EU funding. So, as we look at the year, we think France and Poland will be up double digits. Germany probably in the mid-single digit range. Italy will be down a bit. To your point, Jeff, the sales are a bit backend -- I would say the EBITDA is a bit more back end loaded for us, probably 60%, 65% in the second half when synergies start to -- we start to accumulate more synergies, especially from supply chain in the second half. So, the bottom line of what we're watching -- orders, we're starting to see activity pick up now, now that German legislation is definitized. We saw heat pump applications increase. We saw preorder activity on our website increase as we got into January, so that was very encouraging. So, we're looking at orders, we're looking at clearly filling that second half growth. We're looking at full year EBITDA, which should be at or frankly a little bit ahead of our original business case. And we're going to be aggressive on some of those supply chain synergies to set up the second half EBITDA growth over the first half. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. Thank you. And just pivoting a little bit for Patrick. Patrick, can you just give us, I don't know, as precise as possible, how much actual revenue and profit then is actually in the 2024 guide for security and commercial refrigeration? Patrick Goris : Yes, the -- for the full year? Jeffrey Sprague : Well, it's going to be gone in the second half for your guide, right? How much revenue and profit is actually embedded in the first half guide for those two businesses that are leaving? Patrick Goris : Well, we lose for the full year, we lose about 5% of the exits. And think of the business as being more or less evenly loaded for the full year. So, think of the first year being about $1 billion, give or take, and from a profitability point of view, probably a little bit more profit in the -- yes, and I would say from a margin point of view, similar to what we shared as the margin profile of these businesses. So, give or take $1 billion, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : All right, thank you. Thank you very much. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : Please stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning, and thanks for giving a lot of clear detail amidst many moving parts. In terms of, I guess my first question on the core sort of HVAC segment guide on Slide 15, you've got the sales guided up sort of mid-single digits for the full year. Maybe just any more detail on that in terms of, for example, price versus volumes and maybe what you're assuming for that U.S. resi HVAC business within that sales guide, please. David Gitlin : Yes, Julian, the way I look at it is, resi and our sort of global commercial HVAC business, if you kind of think about it those two ways, those will both probably be up in the high single digit range, and North American -- the light commercial business in North America will probably be down mid-single digits. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And any thoughts on price volume within the segment for the year? David Gitlin : Yes, I would say for price for HVAC, you're looking at about 2% and 2.5% of price. The rest, volume mix. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. And then just a quick follow up on Viessmann Climate Solutions. You talked about that mid-single digit sales growth guide for the year in aggregate. Wonder if any color within that, not so much by region which you addressed, and not so much by sort of seasonality which you addressed, but more perhaps in terms of how much of that growth guide is volume based, and if you'd give any color across some of the products, perhaps, I think investors get very nervous about heat pumps and so forth, but maybe any flavor as to some of the other products, like boilers and so forth. David Gitlin : Yes, it's more volume than price. You're probably looking at a couple of points of price, the rest volume. I would say a few things with respect to organic growth. For Viessmann, where I know some of our peers are talking about lower growth than we are, and here's, I think, some of the reasons, Julian, I would say that we have high confidence in the mid-single digit growth. Number one is that, we're not a heat pump pure play. So we have the ability to flex with boilers depending on kind of what the market conditions are. We are anticipating share gains. Viessmann has introduced new products. There's a new product line in that 16 kilowatts to 19 kilowatts, which will now give us access to more than 90% of the single-family residential market in Europe, where before that sort of higher capacity part of that segment, we did not have a product offering for, and all the way much higher than that, which gets into the multifamily. So, we're looking at not only share gains, but we're also looking at products that introduce us into new parts of the market. The geographic mix we think plays favorable, as we see Germany start to certainly recover in the second half, we'll push on the services, and I do think there's going to start to be some level of benefit on the revenue synergies. Internally, we're targeting a fairly significant number for ourselves that we haven't put into our underlying model. So, we'll start to see recovery of heat pumps taking place. We'll still see some more boiler sales. PV may slow a little bit, which would be something that we'll watch, but it is on the lower margin side for us as a business. So, all in all, I've had a chance to spend a lot of time with the Viessmann leadership team and the salespeople, and we're starting to see now that we have more clarity around the regulations, a lot of activity picking up that we do have confidence will certainly benefit us with growth in the second half. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. David Gitlin : Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Dave or Patrick, I think you mentioned the expectation of sales up high single digit in resi for the year. Can you break that out between price and volume? And then can you talk about the progress you're seeing on rolling out 454-B and then where did inventory in the year in resi versus your target? I think you were talking about down mid-teens. David Gitlin : Well, Andy, it's Dave. Let me try to break it out. I think that, look, we'll expect for resi a few points of price, the rest will be volume mix. Remember, we talked about price for the 454-B units being up 15% to 20% over two years. And the way you can think about that is, a few percent of just basic price this year, a few percent of price next year. Remember, we announced a 6% price increase effective for March for our resi business. And then on top of that, you're probably looking at about a 10% or so price difference for the 454-B units versus the 410-A. And look, I'm proud of the team. I think that we're going to start shipping units as early as March. We'll start for the 454-B. We're going to start on some of the new build side because our home builders don't want a mixed subdivision, so to speak. So they're going to start taking 454-B units a little bit earlier. We'll get some out for national heat pumps for training purposes. I think when all is set and done this year, probably be 80% will be the 410-A and about 20% will be the 454-B. And I'm sorry, Andy, did you have another piece in there that I failed to address? Andrew Kaplowitz : It's just where inventory is in the channel sort of ended the year? David Gitlin : Yes, this was a big one for us. We wanted to end down mid-teens and we ended up down 16% year-over-year in inventory. So that was a fairly purposeful effort by us working very closely with our distributors. That was one of our biggest targets in 4Q. Now 4Q resi ended up being a little bit lighter than we had thought, partly for that reason, as we were making sure that we got as much of the de-stocking behind us in 2023 as possible. And I think we achieved that. Could there be a tiny bit more de-stocking here in 1Q? Yes, but I think that's behind us over the next month or two, and then we'll back to more typical levels. Andrew Kaplowitz : Great. And then sort of the mid-single-digit growth guidance for HVAC. You answered Julian's questions about the mix, but commercial HVAC orders actually reaccelerated a bit up 5%. Are you seeing sort of reacceleration or anything in certain key markets for you guys? And then alternatively on the light commercial side, you talked [indiscernible] down mid-single digits and visibility to that sort of kind of decline in 2024. When we look at orders, we\u2019ve actually been -- it's been robust in the Americas for a while. You look at our sales for -- and orders for the Americas, both last year were up double digits. When we look at sales in commercial HVAC in the Americas, close to 20%. We had very strong double-digit growth in commercial HVAC in Europe. I would say, it's been a little bit surprisingly strong. Orders still were fine in the fourth quarter there as well. And it's partly driven by this continuous demand for data centers. We see positive growth on some of the industrial side in Europe. Asia is still pretty solid. China orders in the fourth quarter were lower than we would have liked, so China is kind of a watch item. But I will say in terms of commercial HVAC in China, we used to be 70% real estate and 30% industrial and infrastructure. It's now 75-25, the reverse. So we're seeing very strong demand for EV production. The data centers continue to be strong in China. So China's clearly properties are weak spot, and I think that will continue, but the rest is strong. So we're actually banking on strong growth in China this year, and we have some level of optimism, because we continue to go where the customers are. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color, guys. David Gitlin : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. David Gitlin : Hey, Deane. Good morning. Deane Dray : Hey, it's kind of hard to see through the fog of all the moving pieces here, but we're hearing more about resumption of seasonality. Just what's baked into the guide regarding what we would typically see as seasonality? Patrick Goris : I would say, Deane, in general, no different than prior years. So we expect, as always, Q2 and Q3 to be, by far, our biggest quarters, generally driven, of course, by what's happening in residential HVAC. And then from a seasonality point of view, more on the cash flow side, as typical, very back-end loaded, so heavy in Q3 and in Q4. In terms of the EPS split, last year we did about 48% in the first half, 52% of our full-year EPS in the second half. This year our current guide assumes it's very similar, maybe a point lower in the first half, offset by a point higher than the second half, so 47%, 53%. But I would say besides that, no big difference in seasonality than we typically see. As Dave mentioned, for Viessmann specifically, we expect it to be a second half -- more weighted towards the second half, one, because of the expected volume pick up given the order activity we're seeing, but also given the cost synergy that we expect to kick in, particularly in the second half of the year. Deane Dray : Great. That's real helpful. And then, Dave, lots of discussion this quarter across the industrials about all of these mega projects, $1 billion plus. It sounds like most of these are still in sort of the front log discussion stage. Where are you positioning and what do you expect to be with regards to win rates and so forth? David Gitlin : Very strong, Deane. We feel very well positioned with the mega projects with some of our scale customers that we really -- we've established a central group to go target some of our bigger scale customers, data centers is just unbelievably strong. It's -- when we look at it, we've talked about the property market being a little bit less than 10% of our commercial HVAC business in the Americas, data centers is bigger as a percentage for us than the real estate market. That's in the low double-digit percentage for us as a company. And we've recently introduced new products. We have a new air-cooled chiller that's helped us get significant wins, both in the United States and in Europe. Europe has seen 10 times growth in data center space over the last two years. So when we look at CHIPS Act bringing some of the production back, we look at data centers. There's other verticals that are strong to education, K-12 has been strong, higher ed, retail -- in some parts of retail, even health care continues to be strong. So we feel very well positioned overall in commercial HVAC. I would tell you, we picked up share last year in the Americas. And in Europe, we were probably flattish in share in Asia. So we feel well positioned with these mega projects. Deane Dray : That's very helpful. Thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : Please stand by for the next question. The next comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Noah Kaye : Good morning. First question, the guidance for mid-single-digit organic growth in the Refrigeration segment for 2024. Can we talk a little bit about the assumptions to get there? And particularly what you're assuming on a regional basis for transport refrigeration? Thanks. David Gitlin : Yes. Yes. I'll take that. This is Dave. Well, first of all, we're looking at a strong rebound in the container business, both in terms of the market and in terms of share. So we think that for us, the container business will certainly be well north of double digits. For the global truck trailer business, that's up in the low single-digit range. The North American truck trailer market, if you look at ACT, that market is down double digits. But remember, last year, it was down significantly, and we actually grew last year, and it's partly because people look at ACT, and that's just a small piece of it. That is the sheer volume for trailers. It excludes things like truck, APUs, pricing mix that we get from electrification. So even though that the market says -- I think the market could be down double digits, ACT, I think, is saying 37,000 units this year from 42,500 or so last year. We actually think that we'll end up probably flattish in both NATT, maybe kind of give or take a point or two. And then I would say flattish on the European truck trailer side as well. Europe would probably be down maybe 1 point or 2, but we continue to see strength in Asia truck trailer. And we see commercial refrigeration business starting to rebound this year, and we're looking at double-digit growth in that business. Noah Kaye : Extremely helpful, Dave. I think when we adjust free cash flow profile back for the onetime cash outflows looking at core free cash flow conversion north of 90%. I guess as we move past some of these transformation initiatives, how do we think about the core free cash flow conversion on a go-forward basis? Is there still that potential to get to 100%? And what are you going to be focused on over the course of this year to get you there? Patrick Goris : Yes. We're always focused on free cash flow conversion. As I mentioned this year in 2023, if you adjust for items like restructuring and some of the M&A-related fees which we adjust out, so they're not part of our adjusted income, we're actually well over 100% of free cash flow conversion. So some of it relates back to you take it over GAAP income or adjusted net income. Now for 2024, our guide for free cash flow. I mentioned $700 million, that includes $1.7 billion of those items. So take $2.4 billion, we expect 2024 to be elevated from a CapEx perspective as well, which is embedded in that guide for 2024. And a key reason for that is that within our Viessmann Climate Solutions business, we're finalizing some of the larger projects. And so we think that our CapEx outlook for 2024 of about $550 million is probably about $75 million or so million higher than what the underlying run rate would be. And so that's an element in 2024. But obviously, taking into account the cash spend on restructuring, we would always target to be at 100% free cash flow conversion. And I think in 2023, if you take that into account, we absolutely didn't. Noah Kaye : Appreciate that. Thanks, Partick. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. Next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. David Gitlin : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : Dave, I want to focus my first question just on Viessmann. So what were kind of like the exit trends for 2023? And then just embedded in that mid-single-digit number for the year, kind of what's expected in the first half of the year? I know it's expected to be a slower start. David Gitlin : Yes. Look, we did see that orders were lighter in the second half, and that did impact -- I would say the fourth quarter came in a little bit lower than we thought. It was still up mid-single digits versus the fourth quarter of last year. But when we look at the calendarization of this year, from a sales perspective, you're probably looking at about 45% or so of the sales in the first half and about 55% of the sales in the back half. When you look at the EBITDA, it's more -- a little bit more weighted towards the back half because that's when we see our synergies start to come in. But as I was mentioning earlier, Joe, I think the encouraging piece is once we got the definitive legislation out of Germany, and you can apply for the subsidies, which become retroactively beneficial effective in -- as of January, we did see -- it was kind of like a tale of two cities. You saw activity on the Viessmann web pages picked up. You started to see energy amongst the installers. And you started to see heat pump applications increase. So clearly, some of that dithering we saw on the legislative side impacted new orders. Now that we have a level of certainty, we're very confident that we'll start to see the heat pump orders and sales pick up in the second half. And Patrick, are you going to add something? Patrick Goris : Yes, Joe, I was just going to say, for Q4 of 2023, Viessmann sales were down about mid-single digits. And then so for Q1 of this year, we expect them to be about flattish with a pickup in the second half of 2024 as Dave just mentioned. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's perfect. That's good color. Thank you both. And I guess just I know we've already kind of talked through the resi HVAC inventory cycle and where we are. I'm just curious just across the rest of your portfolio. Can you maybe just provide some color on inventories? I'm specifically curious on the security business and what you're seeing in that business right now. David Gitlin : Well, look, we -- on the security side, as Patrick said, we've guided for half the year. We feel calibrated on where we are -- for where we are in the first half. And I think that we're sort of back to more normal levels of backlog in security. When we look at other parts, I mean, for our commercial HVAC side, we're still looking at backlog up 30% on a two year stack. So we're well -- we have very good coverage going into the second half of this year. So we feel good about the growth projections that we have for commercial HVAC. And not -- when we look at the light commercial piece, we're watching the inventory levels in the channel. It's partly helped frame our -- when we said we think of sales down in the mid-single-digit range, it's partly because we're watching that. Now I will say we actually, even with our 2024 forecast, it would still be lower than the kind of numbers we saw in 2019, 2018. So we're watching the inventory levels, but we still have very strong coverage heading into 2Q and beyond. So we'll keep an eye on that, but -- and we obviously have a tough compare there. And remember, light commercial is about 5% of all of Carrier. But we'll watch the inventory levels, but we are encouraged by the coverage that we have. Joe Ritchie : Helpful. Thank you, guys. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. The next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. And I echo Julian's comments, thanks for making a pretty complex setup a little bit easier for us. So thanks for details. Just want to go back to Viessmann. And the comments about 45-55, Patrick, I think you mentioned that -- based on our model, we got 50-50 roughly for 2023. So I just want to make sure that's sort of more normal seasonality. And then can you just maybe comment on where we finished up on EBITDA for Viessmann, I think, EUR0.7 billion was sort of the benchmark. And the spur of the question really is, I think, Patrick, you mentioned Viessmann be fairly neutral to margins in 2024. I've got EBITDA margins in the 16.5%, 17% range for 2024. So I just want to make sure that's where you see the Viessmann margins for 2024? Patrick Goris : Okay. Quite a few things there. Nigel, I'll start with the -- where Viessmann ended in 2023. We had said about EUR4 billion and about $700 million in EBITDA. So EUR4 billion in sales. David Gitlin : $700 million. Patrick Goris : In EBITDA. On both items, they came in slightly below. So sales were close to EUR3.9 billion and EBITDA came in about $50 or so million below that. So that's where Viessmann ended the year. In terms of VCS margins for the full year, from an operating margin point of view, Viessmann embedding our guide is right at mid-teens. So right at the, call it, middle of mid-teens. And I think from an EBITDA margin point of view, they're in the high teens. So their EBITDA margin is slightly accretive to the overall company. The operating margin is basically right in line with the company average as well. Nigel Coe : Okay. I'll follow up offline. I thought the depreciation was quite low there, but we'll follow up offline. And just a quick follow-on... Patrick Goris : To that point, that there was a step-up in the fixed assets as part of the transaction and that boosted the depreciation. Nigel Coe : Okay. That makes total sense. And then just thinking about -- Dave, you talked about the ability for Viessmann to pivot between heat pumps and boilers. Just wondering about the mix impact there, because my understanding is, heat pumps are much higher ticket price than boiler. So just wondering if there's a mix impact we should consider as well? David Gitlin : Yes. I think on the margin side, they're both very similar. But clearly, on the sales side, we're looking at about 3 times the price for heat pumps than you're seeing for boilers. So when we look at that heat pump growth, we think long term, you're looking at heat pump growth more than 20%. It remains to be seen whether obviously, a bit of a tough compare last year, whether we'll get that 20% growth in 2024, but the mix that we see between expected heat pumps and boilers is baked into our mid-single-digit guide for them for the top line for this year. Nigel Coe : Great. Thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hi. Good morning, guys. Just a couple of cleanups on HVAC. One, just on resi, maybe speak to sell-through versus sell-in, what are you thinking for the market versus absence of destock? And then the light commercial down mid-single digits, is that purely comps? Or are you seeing order weakness there? David Gitlin : Well, I -- look, on the latter one first, comps is a part of it and orders is just it's very difficult to look at orders, because we're seeing such enormous swings in orders. So you can look at a certain quarter with orders down 30% or 40%. What we're actually looking more at for light commercial is coverage. We're looking at just fundamental demand that we're seeing out in the marketplace and how much backlog we have to support that demand, and then we look at the underlying verticals. So as we look at the first half of 2024, we have good coverage for the sales that we expect, and that goes into -- way beyond where it normally would go. It goes into the second quarter. So we're watching inventory levels. We have generally pretty good coverage. We do know that some verticals remain quite strong, like K-12 and things like some of the lower-end retail parts of the business. And then, we're watching new orders come in to feed the second half of the year in the light commercial space. Please remind me what was your question on resi? Jeff Hammond : Just on resi, what you think market demand is? Yes. David Gitlin : Yes. I think we're now back to a point, which would have been more like what we would have been used to pre-COVID, which is you'll start to see sales and movement start to feel very similar to each other. We sell into the channel, what moves from our channel partners and to the dealers. So we should start to see more of a 1 :1 match for movement, our sales and our movement from our distributors. We're sort of back to more normal levels. And you think about the market over these last handful of years, look at a market level, you're looking at total shipments on ducted splits of back in 2018, 2019 of around $6.5 million. And this year, you're looking at about $6.5 million. So it feels like we're kind of in the zone of where we would have been pre-COVID and we'll grow from there. Last year was a bit of a reset year coming off a couple of years where we got up into that $8 million range. And now we're sort of back to more traditional levels, and we feel good about the growth rates that we have projected for resi for this year. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then just on the commercial resi fire business, when do you think you'll have resolution on what's kind of the lean spin versus sale at this point? David Gitlin : Yes. When we think about -- we're looking at combining the commercial and the residential fire in an exit together. And I'll tell you right now, our number one priority is we want to make sure that we do everything we can to close security, close the commercial refrigeration as effectively and as soon as we can, working with the buyers. And that's a little bit more than half of the EBITDA that we're exiting. The next priority we have in line is industrial fire and that's frankly progressing very well. We're looking at hopefully an announced deal here within the next couple of months. Then we're doing all the prep work right now internally for commercial and resi fire, and we're preparing it both ways. We're preparing it as though we could do a sale with the [QOV] (ph) and all the work associated with that. And we have a whole prep activity around a public market exit. And in the meantime, we're heads down focused on improving the underlying performance of what are really great franchises in those businesses like Kidde and Edwards. And at the end of the day, which way we'll go sale or public market exit, it just comes down to maximizing long-term shareholder value, and we continue to assess that internally. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Great. Appreciate the color. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next call. The next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan. Stephen Tusa : Hi, good morning. Patrick Goris : Good morning. Stephen Tusa : Congrats on closing the Viessmann deal? Patrick Goris : Thank you. We're excited by it. Stephen Tusa : Dave, you mentioned $6.5 million ducted splits. What were you talking about versus the $8.5 million? What exactly data point are you talking about there? David Gitlin : Yes, Steve, I know you've talked different. That's like total split volume for North America. Stephen Tusa : So how does that differ from the HRI data? David Gitlin : For the industry? We can take it off-line, Steve, if you have different... Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then just for -- when we kind of roll forward into 2025, can you just help us with what -- how much -- what that profile looks like? How much OP rolls off and then the interest savings, would that -- how should we kind of maybe put what you're talking about this year in context for next year? Patrick Goris : Yes, Steve. It might be helpful to look at the EPS bridge we included in our deck for this. And the way I'm thinking this is our core business this year, the dark blue one grows by about 14% or so percent year-over-year. Next year, assuming, of course, we exit all the businesses -- at the end of this year, that would be a $0.30 dilutive impact that we would lose. What's not embedded there is, of course, is the offset related to the redeployment of the net proceeds. So core business $2.55 this year per our guide. We would be disappointed, of course, and if we could not continue to grow that at double digits. Add to that, the redeployments of the net proceeds. In addition to that, free cash flow given that we would be close to 2 times net leverage, we'd be back in the market doing repo. And so, I think we would be positioning ourselves for our core business to grow at attractive rates after this year. Hope I answered the question? Stephen Tusa : Yes. So kind of take like $2.55 and then like grow at it at about 10%-ish? Patrick Goris : This year, we're doing 14% in our core business, excluding the impact of the Viessmann dilution, so we'd be disappointed if it'd be less. But -- so yes, somewhere in the teens. On top of that, the redeployment of the net proceeds and the free cash flow we generate, we intend to repurchase the equivalent shares issued to the Viessmann family. And so there is -- I think there's a lot of earnings power available to us. Stephen Tusa : Yes. Okay. That helps. And then just one last one. What was price cost for the quarter? Patrick Goris : Price cost for the quarter? Stephen Tusa : Yes. The net. So what was pricing for the quarter and then the net, yes. Patrick Goris : No, understood. I don't have an exact number, but it was significantly favorable because for the overall company point of view, our margin expanded 80 basis points. That was basically all due to price cost and productivity. I embed productivity in there, Steve. It was probably -- that was over 200 bps offset by some unfavorable mix and investments. Stephen Tusa : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot for detail. Appreciate it. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Your line is open. Brett Linzey : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to come back to Asia and specifically China, you gave a little bit of color there, but fourth quarter orders up 20%, 25% there. Could you just give the complexion between the buildings markets versus transport markets in that order number and some of the activity you're seeing there. David Gitlin : Yes. We -- well, first of all, we saw extremely high. It was around 20% orders in China, Brett. The ref orders were extremely high, but it's a relatively small number amongst -- for the business overall, but that was very high. And we had a little bit of headwind on the commercial HVAC side in China and then F&S was kind of in the mid-single-digit range. So, we were very pleased, I would say, overall, with the orders in China. It's about 9% of our sales when we picked up Toshiba. We picked up a little bit more on the residential and light commercial business. And we have a lot of new product launches in that space. So kind of like what I said with Viessmann before where we introduced a new product that gets us into a new market. Some of the revenue synergies that the team's worked on between Toshiba and Giwee to really introduce some new products into the China market, we think as we know and we anticipate that we'll continue to spend helping us a lot. And I think the big thing is this pivot between what was real estate and property now to some of the more industrial pieces like EV, electronics, infrastructure, manufacturing, strong. So we actually have China for us up in 2024, I think it's in the high single-digit range. Obviously, we all know China will have to continue to watch. But if we feel like if we play in the right spaces in China, we're well positioned. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up to that. You identified the significant synergies at Viessmann. You've had some time for the integration here, maybe put a finer point on the sizing and the timing of those and what really is that new branding, new products and so on? Any context would be great. David Gitlin : Yes. We -- what I would do is, I would put the revenue synergies, and we'll start to dimensionalize those for our investors here over time. But -- it's a little bit early. But what I would do is, put the -- I would put the revenue synergies in three categories. One is multichannel, multi-brand. Viessmann has -- I think everyone would agree, the single best channel for the residential market in Europe. So direct to installers, more than 80,000 installer relationships, and we're looking at introducing a secondary brand, potentially the Carrier brand into that channel. And then there's more we can do with the Toshiba brand in Europe as well. So that's an example. And is there more we can do with the Viessmann brand in places like China or in India or in the United States and North America. So multi-channel, multi-brand. The second one is just pure innovation. They have -- Viessmann has a phenomenal digital tool that they use with their installers. Is there more that we can do to drive services growth through the digital tools that we have within Carrier or that we have within Viessmann or even some of that heat pump technology, could you see more air to water in the United States, especially for homes in places like New England that have radiated heat today or might we see more of a trend even though it's a bit of a niche market around geothermal in the United States. And then the last is what I would call integrated offerings like complete home energy management systems, which Viessmann does very well today in Europe, and that an opportunity for us in the United States, and things like district heating, where we could do a commercial heat pump combined with the apartment transfer units that Viessmann has. So we see a lot of opportunity. We've given a very kind of audacious aggressive target for ourselves internally. And as we get some wins on the board, we'll start to more dimensionalize that for our investors. Brett Linzey : Okay. And that's not baked in this year, right? Back half? David Gitlin : Correct. Brett Linzey : Thank you. David Gitlin : Okay. Well, let me -- let me wrap things up. First of all, thank you all for joining. For us, it's a big day. We're actually here in the New York Stock Exchange. We will be a little bit overdue because we were going to ring the bell when we spun as a public company back in in 2020, but it was COVID, the New York Stock Exchange, which was shut down. So we're excited to have our -- many of our key leaders here with us, and we'll be ringing the bell here shortly. We have customers with us in the building today, which we're excited to spend time with them. And we are so excited about not only 2024, but the future of this company. We are so well positioned around the sustainability trend, and I'm so proud of what this team has accomplished since our spin, but I assure you that our best days are ahead. So thank you all for joining, and Sam, as always, available for questions. Operator : Thank you for participating. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Samuel Pearlstein : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. The company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. We've had an exciting start to the year. We welcomed 12,000 new team members from Viessmann Climate Solutions to the Carrier family, made great progress on our business exits and delivered very strong financial results, positioning us for yet another year of significant margin expansion and solid growth. Starting with the highlights of our strong first quarter results on Slide 3. On low-single-digit organic sales growth, we drove 280 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 19% adjusted EPS growth. I am very proud of the team. We have made enormous progress on our lean journey and driving sustained productivity, and we are seeing it in our results. Our formula is working, drive productivity tenaciously, simplify the business, reduce overhead, invest in growth, all while increasing margins. Our performance and transformation all tied to our clear North Star, to be the global leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions, and we are making great progress on our vision, as you see on Slide 4. We provide our customers with differentiated sustainability solutions. For buildings, our North American small rooftop units have the highest efficiency in the market, with the smallest footprint. Our water cool chillers, with magnetic bearings, provide best-in-class efficiency with the ability to match cooling loads with variable demand during the course of the day. For homes, Viessmann's newly launched heat pumps expand our addressable market in Europe by approximately $5 billion and in typical Viessmann fashion, deliver 15% to 25% energy savings versus competitors and are the quietest on the market. For the cold chain, our new HE19 trailer reefer unit reduces fuel consumption by 30% compared to our previous offerings and by 10% compared to our competition. And our new OptimaLINE container unit consumes roughly 15% less energy than our competitors. Our digital strategy is also a critical enabler and differentiator. For buildings, we now monitor more than 1.2 billion square feet through Abound, a 10% increase from last quarter, with additional key scale customers attracted to our new net zero features. For homes, Viessmann's One Base digital platform is the only home energy management system in the world that integrates space heating and cooling, water heating, solar PV with battery storage with a grid interface. Both Viessmann's One Base platform and our North American InteliSense platform enable early detection of potential malfunctions, with notifications to installers, helping address problems before they occur. In the cold chain, we have recently introduced new capabilities to help optimize cooling and thus, reduce our customers' operating costs, helping us increase link subscriptions by 50% in just the past year. In summary, we are very pleased with our clear traction as the Global Climate Champion, driven by technology and digital differentiation. We also remain very purposeful in driving aftermarket growth as you see on Slide 5. In Q1, aftermarket was up 6%, led by another quarter of double-digit growth in commercial HVAC, and we remain on track for another year of double-digit growth. We now have about 75,000 chillers under a long-term agreement, about 35,000 of which are digitally connected. And our attachment rate reached its highest level ever, 48%. We also connected nearly 5,000 chillers, the highest in a quarter since our spin 4 years ago. The playbook works and our KPIs are consistent and cascaded globally, bringing focus and execution to this imperative. We remain committed to our goal of $7 billion of aftermarket revenues by 2026. When we made this projection at our 2022 investor meeting, it assumed a high-single to low -- a high-single to low-double-digit CAGR. With our planned business exits and now the addition of Viessmann, we will divest about $500 million of net aftermarket sales. So to achieve the 2026 target of $7 billion, we now require a low-double-digit CAGR. We remain committed to this goal and are accelerating the deployment of our proven playbook to achieve it. Turning to Slide 6. We could not be more proud of our combination with Viessmann Climate Solutions. Thomas Heim and his team have been all in on ensuring that our teams work as one, sharing best-of-best product technology, digital solutions, supply chain and operational opportunities and working seamlessly on multibrand, multichannel strategies globally. Viessmann Climate Solutions is a company built on excellence. This is a team that loves to win. The opportunities to leverage its excellence in customer intimacy, product design, channel differentiation, brand strategy, sustainability solution, culture and talent development and operations will give Carrier a clear advantage to sustain differentiation and premier customer satisfaction. We remain deeply confident in the long-term transition towards electrification and sustained growth in the market sustained growth in the market. With Germany aiming to become greenhouse gas neutral by 2045, and individual federal states like Bavaria as soon as 2040, discussions in major municipalities have started as to when the supply of natural gas to households will be limited or effectively stopped. At the same time, 2 weeks ago, the EU adopted the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, under which each member country must adopt its own plan to reduce building energy usage by 20% to 22% by 2035, with at least 55% of the reduction coming from renovations to the worst performing buildings. While the long-term trend towards electrification remains robust, we are clear-eyed about the short-term market headwinds in the European residential market. Despite these headwinds, our team outperformed the end markets in Q1 through share gains, new product introductions, boiler sales and pricing. And our team is poised to continue doing so for the full year. Viessmann's sales in Q1 were down 12% overall, more than half of which was driven by lower solar PV sales, which carry lower margins. For the full year, we now see VCS sales flat to down 5%, with Q2 revenues being similar to Q1 and an expected increase in the second half consistent with a typical seasonal pickup. Though heat pump orders in Q1 were down year-over-year, they were up nearly 60% sequentially and were the highest in the year. Despite 2024 sales expected to be lower than our February guide, we only see a modest impact to our full year adjusted EPS because the team is driving to offset reduced volume with increased productivity and synergies and favorable mix. Cost synergies are tracking to about $75 million in 2024 and over $200 million by year 3. The cost actions position us for higher earnings conversion when the broader market recovers. We also remain very encouraged by revenue synergies, which we believe will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. So we could not be more excited by the opportunities presented by this game-changing combination. Let me shift gears and talk about the unique opportunity presented by data centers, as you see on Slide 7. Over the past 3 years, we've capitalized on this important opportunity by securing key wins with scale customers globally. The AI movement is driving hyper and sustained growth in this space, not only driving data center growth, but also an outsized opportunity for cooling providers, given that AI chips drive 7x the heat generation versus traditional chips. Today, AI makes up about 20% of the load of a typical data center, and some of our customers project that percentage to increase to 80% in the next few years, thus parting huge demand on the grid and increasing the need for differentiated HVAC and control solutions. Accordingly, the data center market for the HVAC business is projected to increase from roughly $7 billion in 2023 to $15 billion to $20 billion in 2027. For us, this vertical represents a low double-digit percentage of our global commercial HVAC applied business, and we see a tremendous opportunity of increasing this segment to well over 20% of our commercial HVAC sales in the next few years. We doubled our backlog in Q1 alone, and in April, secured further key wins as we optimize the use of our global footprint to support our customers. Turning to our transformation updates on Slide 8. In addition to the Viessmann integration, our business exits also continue to progress well. We are moving with speed and maximizing shareholder value. In March, we announced a definitive agreement for the sale of industrial fire for $1.4 billion in gross proceeds. This deal is expected to close in early 3Q. We now have definitive agreements for 3 of our 4 business exits and are within a couple of weeks of issuing or offering memorandum to prospective buyers for our residential and commercial fire business. We are targeting to close that deal by the end of this year. We are focused, but not finished. The entire team remains extremely energized as we draw closer to becoming a higher growth, simpler, leaner pure-play climate champion. The pace of our transformation and the net proceeds put us on track to achieve about a 2x net leverage ratio this year and resume share repurchases in 2024. With that, let me turn this over to Patrick. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. We had a good start to the year. Q1 earnings were well ahead of our expectations and the guide we provided in February. Reported sales of $6.2 billion were up 17%, with organic sales up 2% and a 15% net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures, substantially all Viessmann Climate Solutions. Q1 adjusted operating profit of $927 million was up 44% compared to last year, driven by favorable price and productivity and the contribution of Viessmann Climate Solutions, partially offset by investments. Strong price and productivity also drove adjusted operating margin expansion of 280 basis points compared to last year, despite the about 50 basis point dilutive impact from Viessmann. Core earnings conversion, that is excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency, was well over 100% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $0.62 was up 19% year-over-year and was well ahead of our Q1 guide of $0.50. March was particularly strong, representing 50% of Q1 earnings. Compared to last year, price and productivity more than offset the impact of increased investments and the expected $0.06 dilution from Viessmann Climate Solutions. We have included a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix on Slide 23. Compared to our Q1 expectations, productivity came in stronger, and we benefited from the timing of a few items, including tax, amounting to about $0.05. Free cash outflow of $64 million was in line with typical seasonality and also reflects payments of M&A-related fees. Moving on to the segment, starting on Slide 10. HVAC reported sales growth of 25% reflects the contribution of Viessmann Climate Solutions and 2% organic sales growth. Organic sales in the Americas were up mid-single digits, driven by continued strength in commercial and light commercial, each up around 20%. This was partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in resi. North America resi volume was down mid-single digits, as we guided, and we expect volume to be up year-over-year in each of the remaining quarters. Organic sales in EMEA were down high-single digits, driven by significant weakness in resi light commercial, while commercial sales in EMEA remained strong and were up around 10%. Sales in Asia Pacific were flat, with growth in China, offsetting a decline in Japan as we continue to improve our mix in that country. This segment had very strong quarter -- had a very strong quarter, with a 240-basis-point adjusted operating margin expansion due to price and strong productivity and despite the consolidation of Viessmann Climate Solutions that negatively impacted margin by about 80 basis points. VCS earnings were broadly in line with our expectations, with favorable mix, productivity and synergies offsetting the impact of lower-than-expected sales. An excellent quarter for HVAC. And based on first quarter operational performance, we now expect 2024 full year HVAC segment margins to be up -- to be about 17.5%, up about 100 basis points compared to last year. Transitioning to refrigeration on Slide 11. Both reported and organic sales were down 2%. Within transport, container was up over 50% year-over-year and global truck and trailer was down low teens, driven by North America truck and trailer which was down about 25%, reflecting overall demand and elevated field inventories. As a reminder, North America truck and trailer was up over 40% in last year's Q1. European truck and trailer was flat, and Asia truck and trailer was up a strong 20%. Our Sensitech business, which provides solutions for tracking and monitoring performance at temperature was up mid-single digits. Commercial refrigeration was down low-single digits year-over-year. We now expect the refrigeration segment to be up low-single digits in 2024 organically. Adjusted operating margin was down 120 basis points compared to last year. This was mainly due to the absence of a $24 million gain related to a sale in last year's first quarter. Excluding that gain, Q1 adjusted operating margins were up 150 basis points year-over-year, driven by price and productivity. Moving on to Fire & Security on Slide 12. This segment had strong financial performance in the quarter. Reported sales were up 2%, with 7% organic sales growth, partially offset by a 5% headwind from the KFI deconsolidation. The residential and commercial fire business was up mid-single digits. Adjusted operating profit was up over 50% versus the prior year, and adjusted operating margins were up a significant 610 basis points year-over-year as volume growth, strong productivity and currency more than offset the headwind of the KFI exit. Overall, a very good quarter for this segment. Turning to Slide 13. Total company orders were down about 7% in the quarter, mostly driven by North America truck and trailer orders due to a tough compare. In Q1 of 2023, North America truck and trailer orders were up 50% year-over-year, 5-0. Excluding North America truck and trailer, Carrier's organic orders were flattish in Q1. Overall, HVAC orders were down between 0% and 5% in the quarter. Within the Americas, commercial orders were up mid-single digits and North America resi orders had a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Light commercial orders were down roughly 35% as order rates are impacted by lead times and a tough compare. EMEA commercial orders were up almost 30%, with applied equipment orders up around 60%, including an over 45% increase in data center orders. Organic resi and light commercial order intake in EMEA remains very weak. Within Asia, weak orders in Japan offset growth in other regions. Globally, commercial HVAC orders were up about 10%, and the backlog for that business continues to grow year-over-year and sequentially. Refrigeration orders were down about 25% to 30% in the quarter, mostly driven by the over 40% decline in global truck and trailer, reflecting the trends in North America, I mentioned earlier, along with growth in Europe and Asia. This was only partially offset by continued growth in orders in the container business, where orders were up high teens. Orders in Fire & Security were flat. Turning to Slide 14, guidance. Compared to our prior guidance, the only change with respect to exits is that industrial fire is now included for the first half of the year. Our prior guide included a full year of industrial fire as no definitive agreement had been announced at that time. So all 3 announced exits, access solutions, commercial refrigeration, and industrial fire are now included for the first half only of our 2024 full year guidance. Taking that into account, we now expect reported full year sales of a little less than $26 billion. Earlier business exit timing represents roughly $400 million of reduction and currency translation, another $100 million. Lower expected revenue at Viessmann Climate Solutions is roughly offset by expected upside in light commercial and commercial HVAC. The underlying organic growth rate in our guidance remains, therefore, unchanged at mid-single digits. We are increasing our adjusted operating margin guidance to roughly 15.5%, driven by the strong earnings performance in Q1. We now expect full year earnings conversion to be north of 40%. Interest expense will be about $25 million lower, given the redeployment of the net proceeds from the industrial fire sale. We are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance range despite the earlier exit of industrial fire, which is a $0.05 headwind, given stronger performance in our core business. With the strong performance in Q1 and the exit of industrial fire in the second half, we now expect roughly 50% of full year adjusted EPS to be realized in the first half of the year. Before I get to free cash flow, I'd like to remind you that proceeds from the sale of businesses are reflected in cash flow from investing, and therefore, do not impact free cash flow. However, the tax payments on the gains on the sale of businesses are reflected in cash flow from operations and therefore, do impact free cash flow. Whereas this, of course, does not impact overall cash performance for the company, it does impact our free cash flow metric. Our free cash flow outlook is now $400 million, reflecting about $2 billion of tax payments on gains from the business exits and transaction-related costs. So no change in the $2.4 billion underlying free cash flow performance versus the prior guidance. The lower free cash flow outlook only reflects expected tax payments on the now announced industrial fire sale. Moving on to Slide 15. Adjusted EPS guide to guide bridge. As you can see, our adjusted EPS guide at the midpoint remains $2.85, with stronger operational performance offsetting the $0.05 impact of the earlier exit of industrial fire and the impact of lower expected sales at Viessmann Climate Solutions. The darker blue represents the businesses we are retaining, including Viessmann Climate Solutions, whereas the lighter blue represents the adjusted EPS contribution from the businesses we are exiting. At the midpoint of our new guidance, core adjusted EPS increases $0.05 compared to our February guide to $2.60. In the appendix on Slide 24, you will find a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge at guidance midpoint. Given the tremendous transformation in the portfolio this year, Slide 16 may be a helpful framework for 2025. We start with a baseline of $2.60 from the core business at the midpoint of our 2024 guidance. In addition to our double-digit adjusted EPS growth target from our value creation framework, we expect another half year benefit from deploying the proceeds of industrial fire towards debt reduction. In addition to that, net proceeds from the exit of commercial and residential fire would be available for deployment, including for buybacks. Finally, an additional lever is 2024 and 2025 free cash flow funded share repurchases. All of this is consistent with our prior messaging that we intend to repurchase at least the equivalent 58.6 million shares issued to the Viessmann family, while maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rating. In short, we have several levers available to deliver meaningful adjusted EPS growth in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it back over to Dave for Slide 17. David Gitlin : Thanks, Patrick. We delivered very strong results in the first quarter, and are confident that we will continue to perform while we transform. With the integration of Viessmann Climate Solutions, the completion of our exits and the superb progress on our base business, we continue to position ourselves as the global leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions. And with that, we'll open this up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : In terms of, I guess, the first question, maybe on VCS, no surprise. You talked about sales down low-double digits in Q1 and sort of down low-single digits for the full year as a whole. Maybe help us understand sort of year-on-year, how we should think about the second quarter playing out within that? And then for the year as a whole, how much of that decline is driven by that solar PV business as opposed to the sort of core HVAC part of VCS? David Gitlin : Sure, Julian. Let me start and Patrick can add. Well, we did say actually flat to down mid-single digits for the full year previously, of course, up mid-single digits. We expect for Q2 will be -- the absolute sales number should be about the same as Q1, which, in that case, would put Q2 year-over-year down about 10% to 15%. Our forecast assumes in the second half that revenue would be up about 20% compared to the first half. So this would be typical seasonality. If that were to happen, that would cause us to be down about 5% for the year. If orders pick up and we see better than seasonality pick up in the second half, then we would get closer to flat. As we think about the full year, we still expect positive growth in heat pumps. That's probably up in the mid-single-digit range. We do see boilers down probably in the low-double-digit range. You asked about solar PV, that's probably down more than 30% for the year, which, as we said, has lower margins. And Thomas and the team are doing a superb job with aftermarket. That was up mid-teens in the first quarter, and we think that will continue for the full year. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the HVAC segment. So I think, Patrick, you talked about the full year margins in HVAC being up about 100 points year-on-year. Is that kind of a similar year-on-year rate, we should expect each quarter for the balance of the year? And I just wondered if you made any changes to the assumptions within HVAC? I think you called out stronger growth assumed now for light and applied commercial HVAC? Patrick Goris : Yes. Overall, for the year compared to our earlier guide, we think light commercial and commercial HVAC will be a little bit better. In terms of the year-over-year margin for HVAC as a segment, we do expect Q2 to be up about 100 basis points year-over-year. Q3 will probably be somewhat similar, and then we expect Q4 to be better year-over-year as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Dave, interesting to hear resi and commercial fire now prioritizing sale with kind of year-end close, right? So it sounds like you're close to something -- and so maybe you could address that? And is there something happening on PFAS to kind of expedite this and get it to kind of a sale process that can close? Obviously, we all saw JCI settled something in the MDL a couple of weeks ago. David Gitlin : Yes. Look, we feel that we've been progressing with PFAS very well. The Chapter 11 with KFI has gone exactly kind of as we expected and gone well. And we've been in mediation with the plaintiffs, and that's been progressing well. So we looked at the JCI. Of course, their settlement was for the water claims cases. It didn't cover PI. But I think in terms of us, we're very pleased overall with the progress that the legal team has been making on PFAS. And then in terms of the sale of our residential and commercial fire business, we should be in the market with an offering memorandum probably in 2 weeks. The business is performing extremely well. The EBITDA this year is tracking higher -- much higher than it was last year, and it's progressing -- the business is performing well. And for a whole variety of reasons, we're prioritizing sell. We're not excluding the possibility of a public market exit, but we're prioritizing a sale. We should be in the market with the offering memorandum in a couple of weeks, and we're hoping to close by the end of this year. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. And the biggest question I get on Carrier actually maybe, hits a little close to home. But Dave, you have a recent kind of deal with the company incentive program and the like. Are you there for good? Is the door still cracked open to consider something else. Every other day, I get asked if you're going to Boeing. David Gitlin : Well, Jeff, frankly, I'm really glad you asked that because I do want to address it head on, and I want to be clear that look, I've notified both our Board and the Boeing Board that I am 100% committed to Carrier. I'm really honored to be on the Boeing Board. I'll do everything I can to support that important company as a Board member. But given my commitment to Carrier, I've removed my name from consideration as a potential CEO of Boeing. And I'm not only committed to Carrier, I have to tell you, I'm so excited to be part of this journey. I mean rarely in your career, do you get to be part of such a transformational journey. And I don't know what inning we're in, but we're in the early innings on what I think will go down as one of the biggest transformations ever, and I'm so excited to be on the journey with 70,000 or so team members at Carrier. So I'm staying put 100% committed to Carrier, and I do appreciate you asking that, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : You talked about data centers, low-double digits, global HVAC sales could be 20% over time. I think you said that data centers doubled this quarter in terms of backlog. So could you talk a little bit more about Carrier's position in the data center market? Maybe what you think your share is, where Carrier is in terms of liquid cooling and how to think about the shape of bookings going forward as '24 evolves? Do you see data center bookings continue to increase from what you booked in Q1? David Gitlin : Yes. I think, frankly, we got some really good quarters, Andy, in just even a couple of weeks ago in April. So this is a unique moment in time. It's exponential. Today, I would say in the U.S. We have low share. This is both for water cooled and air cooled chillers, but we think we're incredibly well positioned from a technology perspective. The key for us has not been technology. It's all been about expanding our capacity. So we're maxing out all of our facilities globally, and we're also going to be expanding our capabilities to support this in Mexico as well. So we -- our focus is making sure we're there for the -- all of our customers, especially some of the scale customers that are really leaning into this. It's not like anything we've seen. In some cases, we sell a few water cool chillers at a time. And here, we're looking at selling hundreds in a single order. So we feel very well positioned. We see the growth being exponential. We've invested in liquid cooling. We made a VC-type investment in SLT, which is strategic thermal labs. So that's really positioning us for the liquid cooling space for direct-to-chip cooling, we're seeing strength globally. Probably 70% of our sales are in North America, but we've done extremely well, both in Asia and in Europe. And this is a market that we have a dedicated Tiger team strictly focused on this space because it is such a unique moment in time. Andrew Kaplowitz : Very helpful. And Dave, maybe give us just a little more color into the productivity you drove in Q1. And what you're thinking for the rest of the year? I know you've guided to 30% incrementals in pass, but obviously did 100% there. I obviously understand you raised your margin guidance. But how sustainable is the kind of productivity acceleration you saw in Q1? And given rising material costs, how do you think about sort of the offset there with pricing? David Gitlin : Yes. I have to tell you that Adrian Button and operations team working with our businesses, it is the best that I have felt since I've been at Carrier about our ability to achieve sustained productivity. We have one single source of the truth. Every single one of our productivity actions globally is in one database. We can sort it 20 different ways. We all are marching to the beat of the same drum. I would say materials is doing particularly well. That's probably 50% of our productivity. Logistics is still a tailwind. That's probably 10 or so percent, we're really taking out a lot of overhead, which is a significant piece. And the factories are now resuming to productivity after a couple of years of negative productivity. So we're also coming into the year and every quarter with a lot more productivity spoken for. So I feel tremendous about the progress. Yes we've seen some copper headwind. Price is getting up to like $4.50, but we got a little bit of offset from steel and aluminum. So I think we're very -- we're probably about half hedged on copper for the year. So I feel very -- very, very well calibrated on the year on productivity and also calibrated as we go forward beyond this. Operator : Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc. Thomas Moll : Dave, I wanted to start with an update on A2L. What can you give us there in terms of when you plan to start or ramp production on the pricing front? Any revision or a reaffirmation of what you expect to capture over this year and next? And then if there's a bogey you want to throw out, one of your competitors in the U.S. did yesterday, just in terms of how much of the demand the new product might represent next year, that would be helpful as well. David Gitlin : Yes, I think, first of all, yes, we would reaffirm what we've said about 15% to 20% price increase over 2 years. I mean that includes low-double-digit base price increase, 454B versus the 410A. And then you'll get a few percent of base price this year and next year. So I know there's some skeptics on that. We're already selling the 454B units. We shipped our first in the first quarter. Obviously, it won't be that much over the short term. But we already have a price point in the marketplace for them. We feel confident in the 15% to 20% over 2 years. I had previously said that we thought that about 20% of our mix this year would be 454B. I think it's going to be less than that. But to the extent we ship less 454B, I think that for us for the year will be offset by probably a little more prebuy than we thought on the 410A. So we feel good overall about this year calibrated at resi at the high-single digits. I saw what one of our peers said yesterday about the mix next year. I think it -- look, it's early to say. I think they were suggesting in the 60% range for 454B. I think it will be more than that. I think you'll have some prebuy at the end of this year on the 410A, and that will cover into some percentage of the volume into 1Q, maybe a tiny bit into 2Q, but I think the bulk of the year will transition to 454B. So I don't know if it's in the 70% range, but it's -- I think it's a bit higher than 60%, but it remains to be seen. Thomas Moll : And Dave, a follow-up on light commercial HVAC trends in Americas. Orders were down meaningfully, but obviously on a tough comp. Can you just refresh us on your revenue expectation there this year and describe any aspect of the demand environment? David Gitlin : It's hard to look at year-over-year quarters, yes. Quarters -- orders in the quarter were down significantly. We look more at how we're positioned for the year. I think that we had said that sales for light commercial would be down mid-single digits this year, which assumed volume down high-single digits. Given that our first quarter was up a little north of 20% on sales, and we still have good backlog. Patrick said it. But I clearly think there's upside to that number. And there's still verticals that remain strong. You look at K-12, some of that value-based retail, some healthcare space like some of the urgent care centers, some of the quick-serve restaurants, they're still strong. So even though we expect year-over-year orders to decline, that base business remains very strong. And by the way, we keep -- we keep taking share and taking share of the right way based on technology differentiation. So still a good vertical for us. And again, I think, upside to our original guide on light commercial. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray : Just circle back on Viessmann. People were holding their breath about destocking. So just kind of where does that all shake out? And your line of sight on the resumption of the various European country incentives. I know you touched on that, in the prepared remarks. But what's the typical lag once the Germany reinstatates, Italy reinstates, I think they have done that already. But what's the typical lag between you start getting those orders? David Gitlin : Well, look, I think in terms of the first piece. Because we're direct to installer, we don't see the same destocking that many of our peers do. So I think that the way we look at it is that piece is largely behind us. We're now back to traditional book and ship business. So the significant backlog that existed -- like many of us, we saw the same thing in our U.S. resi business, you had just an untypical -- atypical high level of backlog a year, 1.5 years ago, that's now back to normal levels. When we look at what's kind of happening in Germany, and I think it's true in other countries that once the legislation gets promulgated, you do typically see and we're experiencing there's a bit of a lag between the subsidy definitization being finalized and new applications. So the question is why would both boilers and heat pumps be down? I think that many customers in Germany know and throughout Europe know that, long term, you're going to transition to heat pumps. They wanted to make sure that the new legislation was going to stick and that there wouldn't be change. Obviously, the market is a little bit tight in Europe overall -- on the overall economy. But now that the legislation is clearly firm, we do expect to see orders start to pick up. And what our expectation is orders start to pick up as we get into May and June that position us for the heating season as we get into September and October. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. And then one of the other questions that we get on the dynamics of the heat pumps in Europe as -- what about this threat of some of the Asian players coming in at a discount product? And would that matter? Would it take share -- and our view is that there's always been a good, better, best stratification of brands in HVAC, and Viessmann is at the high end. You rattled off some of the future comparisons. But just what -- is there a risk about new entrants into the European heat pump market? David Gitlin : Well, I think you answered it perfectly well, Deane. I do think that Viessmann clearly plays in the premium end of the market. So I do think that even though there will be more competition at the entry tier level and the mid-tier, we think that because of the brand, the technology differentiation, the unique channel, we don't see that as a major threat directly to Viessmann. I will add, by the way, that I was talking to the CEO of a major German company. And he was so impressed with the combination of Carrier and Viessmann Climate Solutions together, he said that if you look at German brands. If Viessmann is not #1, it's in the top 5 most respected brands in the country. And he was saying to me, kind of unsolicited how powerful this combination will be. So we'll preserve the Viessmann brand at the very high end. We are introducing Carrier in the mid-tier range both for heating and for cooling. So we think that's a unique space. And of course, we have Toshiba. So yes, there will be some new entrants in the market, but we feel not only is Viessmann protected on the high end, but we're actually seeing a bit of price tailwind as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer & Company. Noah Kaye : Dave, I'd like to stick with VCS. You highlighted early on the new product introductions, expanding the TAM by $5 billion. Would just love some more color on those product introductions. Curious to know to what extent they were developed in kind of any kind of synergy or technology road map coordination with legacy Carrier? And to what extent that's an opportunity going forward across the portfolio? David Gitlin : Yes. Look, no, I wish I could take some form of credit, but this was done well before our watch. I mean this was Viessmann, over a period of time, developing products for the 16 to 19-kilowatt range, which is in that very high-end single-family home which is a new market for them, which they introduced in the first quarter. And here in the second quarter, they introduced 19 up to 40 kilowatts, which gets you into that small multifamily residential space. So very, very attractive new -- very attractive new product introductions. I mentioned this $5 billion TAM that they now position themselves for. So again, it's one of the many reasons why you can see headline articles about heat pumps being down in Germany in the many tenth percentage range, while we'll be like flat or even heat pumps could be up for us this year. One of the reasons is the new TAM. I will say, though, on the latter part of your question when it comes to revenue synergies, we are actively working on a whole bunch of technologies. And that's why I said that we could see revenue synergies in the hundreds of millions, and we put virtually zero in our business case. I think that's going to -- when we look back 5 years from now, I think we'll look and say that was one of the best upside to the business case that we saw. Even in North America, Viessmann has just introduced -- traditionally in North America, Viessmann was a boiler sale company. They've just introduced an air-to-water heat pump for North America, which could be very attractive in places like New England and Canada and some other discrete locations. And we can leverage their technology with our channel to go really attack the market in the United States. So a lot of interesting upside there. Noah Kaye : Very interesting. And just on applied strength. I mean how much of this is just the data center story? How broad-based is it? Maybe you can talk on some of the other verticals where the demand just continues to sustain? David Gitlin : Well, a lot of it is data centers. That's been very, very strong. Higher ed still remains strong. Healthcare, like hospitals, remains strong. When you look at it, it varies a little bit by region. We've seen some changes in China, for example. What was very strong in China was EV, solar production, all things renewables, that's now shifted in China. So we're now seeing strength in China from things like infrastructure and some of the other aspects of decarbonization. So some of the areas of strength will move. Data centers is strong globally. And then what's frankly been strong other than some changes within China remains strong. And what's been weak like commercial office has generally remained weak. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : I want to go back to the C&R fire sale. I've got to say we were expecting a capital markets transaction, Dave. So just wondering if you had some indication of interest for that asset that gives you confidence in that sale process? And maybe, Patrick, if you could maybe size that business, we've got $2 billion of revenues, about 10% EBITDA margin, maybe it sounds like it's having a good year. So maybe just give us a projection for 2024. David Gitlin : Yes. Look -- and Nigel, I mean you were expecting it because I said it. So very fair. So we've changed. We are 100% prioritizing a sale. We completed about, I think, a 15-page teaser. We've discussed that with a number of interested buyers. The interest has been very high. So we've been extremely pleased with the reaction because it's a great set of assets. I mean you could see our Fire & Security business is performing very well. You're looking at Edwards very differentiated, GST very differentiated, Kidde very differentiated. You have a phenomenal set of brands that are uniquely positioned in their various spaces. So we'll see exactly where it ends up, but I am very pleased with the level of interest thus far, and we'll send out our offering memorandum in 2 weeks, Patrick, on the financials? Patrick Goris : Yes, Nigel, you can think of that business being roughly $2 billion, I'm rounding. And the current run rate EBITDA is in about the mid-200s now. So much better, and so we're happy with the improvement we're seeing in that business. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's great color. And then back to VCS. I mean based on the comments, Patrick, you made about the dilutive impact on the segments, I'm backing into maybe a 14.5% operating margin, maybe 15.5% EBITDA margin. For the quarter, is that right? And I'm just wondering if that is correct, if my math isn't too wonky, what is the path to high teens for the full year? Patrick Goris : Yes. So from an operating profit margin point of view, Nigel, you can think of Q1 being about 12.5%. And for the full year, again at the EBIT low it will be around 15%. Actually, we think maybe a little higher than that. So in line with the overall company average, but below the average for the HVAC segment. And that's at the EBIT level. And you can probably add a couple of points for that 2, 3 points to get to EBITDA. Operator : And our next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan Chase & Company. C. Stephen Tusa : Just on that EBIT comment, that's EBITA, right, excluding the amortization when you say EBIT? Patrick Goris : Yes, that's right, Steve. We adjust out the intangible amortization and some of the step-ups as well. C. Stephen Tusa : Yes, you guys said, I think previously, you added a bunch to D&A versus the prior guidance. Is that just truing up some of the financials on Viessmann? Patrick Goris : Yes, Steve, you're right. In essence, at the time of the February guide, of course, we didn't have all the detail to provide the best accurate estimate of the DNA. And so inventory and backlog step-up was not yet fully included there. And also since then, we refined the difference between the intangibles and then the goodwill, and that impacts the amortization as well. So you can think of that being the new driver. C. Stephen Tusa : Got it. And then sorry, just on resi, just to follow up on the 454 A2L. Did you guys -- I think -- you guys are like -- at least we had heard your amongst the earlier movers on that. You already have a product in the channel, which is congratulations on that. That's definitely ahead of some of your peers. Did you kind of -- have you been pivoting at all as far as evaluating the market and working the 410A product in there as the demand changes? Like how fluid is that situation? That's kind of the first question. And then just a very quick follow-up for Patrick. Can you just give us the price and inflation for the first quarter? And then just any updates on that for the year for the bridge? David Gitlin : Yes. Let me -- yes, Steve, let me start on the A2L. Our strategy is to -- we did it with the SEER change. We're doing it with the A2L change, derisk everything, get way out in front. We don't want any technical producibility, capacity, any issues as we get into the end of this year. Our #1 priority is to support our customers to make this a seamless transition. So we are getting way out in front, not only on shipping the product, but on training our dealers. We had 1,000 dealers -- over 1,000 dealers together last week. We had closer to 10,000 together for a discussion probably about 18 months ago. So we are getting all over in terms of the preparation. And I do think that -- as I mentioned, I think it will be less than 20% A2L this year, probably a bit of prebuy on 410, but I do think it will be higher than that 60% that I know others mentioned for next year. Patrick Goris : Okay. And then Steve, following up on your questions about price. Price for the quarter was about 2%. For the overall company, we expect that to be about the same for the full year. So about half of our organic growth price. In terms of price and net productivity combined, that includes the headwinds of material inflation, for example, that combined was about $200 million in Q1, and we expect that to be about $600 million for the full year in our current guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Gautam Khanna : I was wondering if -- just talking about 2025 in that bridge, is the growth algorithm still kind of north of 10% earnings growth off of the adjusted base? If you could just talk through kind of your '25 expectations, given the bridge that you provided on what the remainco is and the like? Just off of what basis, if you will? Patrick Goris : Right. So if you look at Slide 23 of the deck that we posted, our core business this year is up 12% -- or in Q1 was up 12%. For the full year, we expect our core business, including the dilution from Viessmann in year 1, the growth to be 17%. And our value creation framework says that we'd like to grow our business double digits every year. So management, I think, would be very disappointed if our core business would not grow at least double-digit EPS in 2025. And on top of that, as you can see on that slide, there are the additional levers, redeploying net proceeds from industrial fire for half a year. That's going to be net -- that's going to be debt reducs, [indiscernible] for industrial and commercial fire. I mentioned earlier, run rate EBITDA of $250 million, you can assume a multiple on that and some tax leakage. That would be available for redeployment, including buybacks, plus free cash flow generated in 2024 and 2025 ex dividend, again, available for deployment, including buybacks. And so a long way of saying, we think there is significant earnings growth power available to us. Gautam Khanna : And what would your opinion of free cash conversion in '25 be off of that approximately $3 number? Patrick Goris : We -- I haven't provided the $3 number, but whatever the number is, we target about 100% of net income. Gautam Khanna : And just a quick follow-up on resi. There's been a lot of chatter about repair versus replace and potential trading down. Have you seen any evidence of that? I know it's early in the cooling season, but any opinion on... David Gitlin : Yes, sorry to interrupt. No, we have not seen any evidence of that. We ask that ourselves a lot, and we have not seen evidence of that. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Brett Linzey : I wanted to come back to light commercial. Obviously, it's been a source of strength for a few years here, orders did take a step down in the first quarter. But you did talk about the light commercial being a profit outperformer for the year. Maybe just some detail on the expectations on some of those moving pieces. David Gitlin : Yes. Look, I mean, it's a question we get because it's been so strong for so long. So -- last year, we were up 35%. We knew we'd have a tough comp coming in into this year. But I think it's a very nice combination of share gains, the underlying verticals that have been strong, generally remaining strong, the team performing. And of course, we don't talk about it as much, but we'll have the same 454B dynamic here, where we see the same kind of base price and mix increase that we're mentioning for resi, we see for light commercial. So that 15% to 20% over 2 years. There won't be the same kind of prebuy. There might be a little bit on the small rooftop units, but -- so you would expect to see an even higher mix next year for 454B, which gives you a tailwind as you go into light commercial next year. And these verticals continue to be strong. So we think it will be slightly better than down mid-single digits this year, given more than 20% in the first quarter. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. And then just shifting over to container up 50%. I guess is the worst behind us here? What are you hearing from some of those customers? And then anything on sort of the sequential trends through the -- in the last couple of quarters? David Gitlin : Yes, I do think the worst is behind us, Brett. I mean we were up significantly in the fourth quarter. We were up about 50% in the first quarter. I think for the full year, it's probably up in the 30% range. And then you look at -- the other thing that we've done, which is very important, is we've introduced a new digital platform for that space as well called Lynx, which instead of just being an equipment provider, we're now getting subscription-based recurring revenues. And we have 130,000 subscriptions for something that we just introduced a few years ago. So hats off to the team there as well. And that will help smooth some of the cycles in that business. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a question on the buyback. You guys alluded that you have capacity to start the buyback in '24. How is it incorporated in your current outlook? Just trying to understand that? Or is that where the margin of safety comes for the guide? Patrick Goris : Yes, Andrew, thank you for your question, and I'll provide some context on this. So since the acquisition, we paid down about $500 million in term loans in Q1. And the 3 exits that we have announced will yield about $5.5 billion in net proceeds. So that's our expectation. And what we communicated is that all of this will be used for deleveraging, although we may keep some as cash as it may be economically more attractive than just paying down some of the debt. But excluding -- if I look at the buybacks for this year, we have not included them in our guide for the year. But given the timing of our free cash flow, generally, it would be second half weighted. And as you probably recall, our free cash flow tends to be very heavy in Q3 and in Q4. So not included in our guide. As we resume it in the second half of the year, there might be some benefit. I think the benefit will be much more meaningful in 2025 than it will be in 2024. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up on Viessmann. What's your ability if -- for whatever reason, second half orders do not pick up as you expected, what's your ability to accelerate restructuring at Viessmann? Because I guess you guys kept the outlook for restructuring flat versus last quarter. Are you gated or limited in any way what you -- on the timing what you can do in Germany? Are there levers on cost at Viessmann that you can still pull in '24? David Gitlin : Yes. Andrew, I have to say I've been so proud of Thomas and the team working with the central apps folks at Carrier to be incredibly and appropriately aggressive on cost. And if you look at the actions that Thomas has taken, what's been very important for that -- for our 12,000 new colleagues at Viessmann that fully understand this is it has nothing to do with the combination with Carrier. It's all actions that business would have taken because of the overall market conditions. So they've been very aggressive on all elements of takeout of cost, not just on basic G&A, but they've been aggressive on materials, logistics costs, value engineering, which is part of the benefit and insourcing part of the benefit of coming together with Carrier. And they're going to continue to take cost. So there's a lot of levers that, that business can and will pull to take costs out of the business. There are certain kind of natural limitations in the agreement that we had with them, but those are not things that are in any way going to affect the ability for that business to take the appropriate cost actions. Andrew Obin : So when you talk about cost synergies, that excludes whatever actions, as you have alluded, Viessmann would have taken these actions, regardless given the market conditions? Is that the fair point that there's $200 million by year 3, we have, but at the same time, Viessmann can accelerate internal cost control given the market conditions? Is that the right way to think about it? Sorry. David Gitlin : I think it's a fair description, Andrew. I -- look, I think cost synergies, we have a very specific definition we use. It's cost that's taken out because of the combination. So there's a bunch of examples of that where we both buy from the same supplier, and we have the ability to go renegotiate with those suppliers or the ability to get more work to certain suppliers. We have a whole lot of value engineering between Toshiba, Carrier, GWA and Viessmann. So there's things that cost takeout that we can do because we're now part of the same family. We see it with some of our factory optimization. So yes, there's cost takeout that they're doing on their own, and then there's cost synergies on top of that. Yes, thank you. And just to close it out, I want to end by thanking our customers who always support us and our team who is doing a phenomenal job. So thank you also to our investors. And as always, Sam will be available all day for questions. Thank you, all. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations and CFO of the Fire & Security Segment. Please go ahead, sir. Sam Pearlstein : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. The company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Once the call is open for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to give everyone the opportunity to participate. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Let me first welcome Ed Dryden to Carrier, who comes to us from RTX Collins Aerospace to lead our Refrigeration business, bringing extensive experience driving business growth and delivering results. Ed succeeds Tim White has moved into a new Chief Product Officer role responsible for program execution and our increased focus on global platforms, both reporting to me. Welcome, Ed, and thank you, Tim. Pivoting to 2Q, another strong quarter. Q2 organic sales -- or excuse me, Q2 organic orders were up roughly 30% year-over-year and HVAC organic orders were up over 40% with very strong order intake in data centers. Better-than-expected and continued strong sales growth in our Global Commercial and Light Commercial HVAC businesses helped to offset weakness in our RLC businesses in Europe and China. Importantly, our Resi business in North America returned to year-over-year volume growth and given strong orders and low inventory channel levels, we are now poised for a strong second half. Also, we continue to execute well, as reflected by another quarter of significant margin expansion. Q2 adjusted operating margins expanded by 200 points to 18.1% and adjusted EPS was again up double-digits, fueled by strong productivity driven by our Carrier excellence business operating system. While we perform, we continue to transform. We closed on the sales of our Access Solutions and Industrial Fire businesses, KFI closed on its sale, and we expect to close the Commercial Refrigeration transaction around the end of Q3. We are also making great progress on the sale of our Residential and Commercial Fire business. Strong free cash flow in the quarter of about $550 million and our progress on the business exits have contributed to our significant net debt reduction in the quarter and have positioned us to initiate a multi-billion dollar share buyback, $1 billion targeted for the second half of this year. As you can see on Slide 4, we continue to stay laser-focused on and make great progress towards our North Star being the global leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions. Each word of our vision has meaning, and we are purposeful in our investments to prioritize the key elements of our strategy. As a global leader, we have gained share across all major segments. Connectivity is a key enabler to provide scalable intelligent solutions. We now have almost 40,000 connected chillers on track to 50,000 by year-end. Our Abound intelligent building platform now monitors over 1.1 billion square feet, and we currently have over 150,000 paid subscriptions for our Lynx cold chain platform. We have also established an AI center of excellence. Internally, we are targeting increased productivity for everything from contract reviews where we have seen improved productivity of up to 90% to call centers. Externally, we now provide services to customers combining classic and generative AI, analyzing data alongside service and maintenance records to deliver more real-time and proactive chiller maintenance. We continue to innovate and launch differentiated sustainable solutions. In Q2, we introduced a low GWP variant of our award-winning AquaEdge Water Cooled Chiller. Likewise, we are the first to offer 3 ton to 10 ton entry tier rooftop units using our highly differentiated EcoBlue fan technology with low GWP refrigerants. All these offerings provide our customers with energy savings, while reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. We play a key role in enhancing grid resilience. For example, Viessmann Climate Solutions recently launched a battery energy storage system with expanded capacity from 15-kilowatt hours to now 75-kilowatt hours, importantly expanding our addressable market. The solutions concept relates to the unique value propositions that we provide to our customers and greater recurring revenues they provide to us. You see examples of our continued traction on aftermarket on Slide 5. Aftermarket growth in Q2 was 9%, and we are confident that this year, we will deliver another year of double-digit growth. We have further refined our playbook with new digital tools that we have cascaded globally driving both better execution and new solutions for our customers. We are confident that our proven formula works as we continue to target double-digit aftermarket growth forever. Moving to Slide 6. About a year ago, we announced that we would be transforming Carrier into a more focused pure-play higher growth company with significantly higher exposure to the secular tailwinds around sustainability, electrification and energy resilience. I am proud to report that our team continues to do what we say we're going to do. We are successfully integrating with Viessmann Climate Solutions a truly world-class organization. Our divestitures remain very much on track and we are deploying the proceeds as committed. Our first three exits will yield over $7 billion in gross proceeds. Our commercial and residential fire exit is also progressing well, supported by excellent business performance. We plan to announce a signed agreement before the end of Q3 with a transaction closed around year end. Given our progress, we have reduced net debt by over $5 billion in the second quarter and plan to initiate our multi-billion dollar buyback that I mentioned earlier. With the portfolio transformation tracking to plan, we are heads down focused on working with Viessmann Climate Solutions to realize the full potential of this tremendous combination and you can see our progress on Slide 7. This is truly a world-class team and business. Our heat pumps are unquestionably differentiated, providing superior electricity savings for our customers. Noise attenuation, energy efficiency, ease of installation, reliability and aesthetics are all best-in-class. We have added 1,500 direct-to-installer relationships this year and continue to expand our network. The successful launch of our new larger capacity heat pumps will give us a point of growth this year, and we expect more than that next year. Viessmann Climate Solutions has gained share in heat pumps across all primary countries where it sells with particular strength in Germany. We have also realized positive price year-to-date. We have identified hundreds of millions of dollars of run rate synergy savings. The most immediate opportunity is leveraging our respective channels. For example, in Europe, we have already delivered our first Carrier branded air conditioning units and our Beretta-branded boilers through the Viessmann channel. Given that only 20% of homes in Europe have air conditioning, roughly 12% in Germany, we see a unique opportunity for us to grow in the cooling only space. We are also leveraging our combined technology strengths. Examples include deploying Viessmann's One Base digital platform across all residential applications and at a systems level, working to provide unique home energy management solutions for North America using Viessmann's battery and systems integration capabilities. We remain on track to achieve $75 million of cost synergies this year, and over $200 million by year three with particular progress on supply chain, logistics, and value engineering. The team is also taking tough, but necessary additional cost control actions. All of this set us up for higher conversion rates. We are also clear that the residential market in Europe has been weaker than we expected. BCS Q2 sales were down about 30% year-over-year, roughly one third of which was driven by lower solar PV sales. And our revised outlook for 2024 assumes about a 15% drop in year-over-year sales with a typical seasonal pickup in the second half. Importantly, we still have deep conviction in the long-term strategy and growth profile of the business. The EU remains steadfast in its target for 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and the shift to heat pumps must play a critical role. Over 25% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe come from boilers in homes. Heat pumps are clearly the best alternative to fossil fuel home heating. So we remain confident in this continued long-term transition. The reality in our industry is that the macro surrounding certain geographies and verticals will not be strong every year. And the great thing is that we have been very purposeful about constructing our portfolio to provide focus, resiliency, balance, growth and increased exposure to key secular trends all of which you see on Slide 8. We love our positions globally. We are number one or two in most segments with prospects to achieve the same ranking in other targeted segments. Not only do we believe that we have the right presence in the right markets, we have the global scale in engineering operations, aftermarket and other functions to benefit the entire portfolio. The combination of our portfolio and our performance culture gives us confidence that we will continue to consistently deliver on our commitments. As we look ahead to 2025, we are poised for strong growth across a significant percentage of our portfolio. With that, I will turn it over to Patrick. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. We had a good second quarter. Earnings were in line with our expectations and ahead of our implied adjusted EPS guide provided in April. Reported sales of $6.7 billion were up 12% with organic sales up 2%. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net contribution to sales of 11%, substantially all driven by Viessmann's Climate Solutions, partially offset by the absence of one month for Access Solutions. Q2 adjusted operating profit of over $1.2 billion was up 26% compared to last year, mostly driven by the contribution of Viessmann Climate Solutions, price and productivity. Continued strong productivity also led to a 200 basis points adjusted operating margin expansion. Core earnings conversion that is excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency, was over 200% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $0.87 was up 10% year-over-year. Compared to last year, organic growth price and productivity more than offset the dilutive impact of the Viessmann Climate Solutions acquisition. We have included a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix on Slide 22. Compared to our Q2 expectations, headwinds from lower earnings at Viessmann Climate Solutions and the earlier timing of the Access Solutions exit were offset by stronger sales in commercial HVAC and North America light commercial HVAC, productivity and a few cents from the timing of taxes. Free cash flow of about $550 million was better than expected, mainly driven by working capital performance and on a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is up 35% compared to last year. Moving on to the segments, starting on Slide 10. HVAC reported sales growth of 18% and reflects the contribution of Viessmann Climate Solutions and organic sales growth of 2%. Organic sales in the Americas were up mid-single digits, driven by double-digit growth in commercial and light commercial. North American resi was up about mid-single digits, and we expect volume to be up year-over-year in each of the remaining quarters. Organic sales in EMEA were up low-single digits, driven by about a 15% increase in commercial HVAC, partially offset by weaker residential and light commercial sales. Sales in Asia Pacific were down around 8% driven by weakness in our residential and light commercial markets in China, partially offset by double-digit growth in South Asia. The HVAC segment expanded adjusted operating margins by 110 basis points due to net price and strong productivity. Overall, another strong quarter for HVAC. Transitioning to refrigeration on Slide 11. Organic sales were up 1% and reported sales were flat. Within transport refrigeration, container was up around 35% year-over-year, while global truck and trailer was down mid-single digits, driven by about a 15% decline in North America. European truck and trailer was up mid-single digits and Asia truck and trailer was up over 25%. Our Sensitech business, which provides solutions for tracking and monitoring temperature was up mid-single digits. Commercial refrigeration was down mid-single digits year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was flattish compared to last year. This was driven by favorable net price and productivity offset by business mix. Moving on to Fire & Security on Slide 12. Reported sales were down 7% with 3% organic sales growth, partially offset by a 10% headwind from the absence of one month of Access Solution and the deconsolidation of KFI in last year's second quarter. The Residential and Commercial Fire business was up mid-single digits and is performing well. Adjusted operating margins were up a significant 310 basis points year-over-year as organic volume growth and strong productivity more than offset headwinds of the business exits. Overall, a very strong quarter for this segment. Turning to Slide 13. Total company orders were up about 30% in the quarter. Overall, HVAC orders were up over 40% with strength across key verticals. Within the Americas, orders were up over 70% with commercial orders up over 40% and light commercial orders about 5%. North America resi orders were up over 100% or around 60% when excluding preordering for late Q3 and Q4 deliveries this year. EMEA organic orders were up over 10% with commercial orders up over 15%. Organic resi and light commercial order intake in EMEA was down low-single digits. Within Asia, weak orders in China were only partially offset by other countries. Globally, commercial HVAC orders were up over 20% and the backlog for that business continues to grow. We booked large data center orders in all regions, positioning us for continued strong commercial HVAC growth. Refrigeration orders were down over 5% in the quarter, with strength in container offsetting some weakness in North America truck trailer. As a reminder, our North America truck trailer orders were up almost 90% in last year's second quarter. Truck and trailer orders in Europe and Asia continue to be strong. Orders in our Resi and Commercial Fire business were up over 10%. Turning to Slide 14, guidance. Before I get into the details, I will share that you will see in the 10-Q later today that we expect consistent with accounting rules that as we get closer to announcing a sale of the Resi and Commercial Fire business, the Fire & Security segment in aggregate, will likely be presented in discontinued operations in future quarters. This could happen as early as Q3, but would not apply to commercial refrigeration. We do not yet know the full impact on reported earnings from continuing operations this year, which is why our July guide is consistent with how we have been disclosing our results. In addition, we plan to continue to disclose actual and projected 2024 results of our core business, that is all the businesses we are keeping, including Viessmann Climate Solutions which we continue to see as the best base to project 2025 financial performance. With that, let me provide our outlook for 2024. With respect to exits, our updated guide now includes commercial refrigeration for nine months compared to six months in our previous guide. We now expect reported full-year sales of roughly $25.5 billion compared to a little under $26 billion in our April guide with underlying organic growth of mid-single digits remaining unchanged versus prior guide. The expected upside from our Commercial and Light Commercial HVAC businesses essentially offsets lower revenue at Viessmann Climate Solutions. Lower residential and light commercial sales in China and a stronger foreign currency translation headwind are only partially offset by having commercial refrigeration for another quarter. We are maintaining our adjusted operating margin guide of roughly 15.5%, maybe a little more. and continue to expect full-year core earnings conversion to be north of 40%. Interest expense is expected to be about $510 million based on the timing of the exits and redeployment of the net proceeds. The end result is that we are maintaining our adjusted EPS guide range of $2.80 to $2.90. Our free cash flow outlook remains $400 million reflecting about $2 billion of tax payment on gains from the business exits and transaction and restructuring-related cash costs. Our underlying free cash flow outlook remains $2.4 billion. Moving on to Slide 15, full-year adjusted EPS year-over-year guidance bridge. Adjusted EPS increases from $2.73 last year to $2.85 at the midpoint. The darker blue represents the business we are retaining, including Viessmann Climate Solutions, whereas the lighter blue represents the adjusted EPS contribution from the businesses we're exiting. You can see that the adjusted EPS from our core business is projected to be up 17% compared to last year. The operational contribution of $0.55 now reflects stronger business performance within our commercial and light commercial HVAC businesses as well as stronger productivity. Increased dilution from Viessmann Climate Solutions reflects lower expected sales. We updated the impact of the exits to include the net effect of losing seven months of earnings from Access Solutions, six months of earnings from industrial fire, and only three months of earnings from commercial refrigeration, all offset by net interest savings from the proceeds. There is a modest benefit from our planned $1 billion in share repurchases in the second half and the headwind from a higher year-over-year adjusted effective tax rate. In the appendix on Slide 23, you will find a full-year adjusted EPS guide-to-guide bridge. And on Slide 24, there is a summary of additional items, which were also updated as part of the new guide. With respect to the third quarter, we expect sales of about $6.6 billion and adjusted EPS of about $0.80 including a few pennies from businesses yet to be divested, and we expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be up 500 bps compared to last year, a $0.06 headwind. In summary, a good second quarter overall and on track for another strong year. With that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. David Gitlin : Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : David, I think you've been saying that as you own Bison for longer that you get more visibility expected orders and sales ramp. Obviously, you lowered your guidance for the business, but how would you characterize the new guidance. I think you're still talking about a typical seasonal pickup. Is that 20% growth off a lower base? Or do you see expectations now as more de-risked for the second half ramp? David Gitlin : I would call it more de-risked, but it's also about 15% to 20% growth in the second half over the first half. So we had said that previously, but now we're coming off of a lower base. I think in terms of the typical seasonality, as we start getting into the heating months, we went back a number of years and that number of 15% to 20% is true almost over 90% of the time. So we are -- we do think we've de-risked the forecast for the rest of the year. We do need to see this as we start thinking about '25, what we're really looking at is this inflection point. As we get closer to October, which in Germany is when the subsidies start paying back, we'd like to see orders pick up at the very end of August, leading into September and start building that orders pipeline that gives us the kind of growth that we'll expect for next year, but we do feel balanced for the revised forecast for this year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Very helpful. And then could you give us a little more color into the order trends you saw in the quarter? I know you had a relatively easy comp and you already talked about some data center orders. But maybe you could talk about the inflection that you saw. Was the inflection bigger than you expected? Was mostly data centers in commercial and the expected turn in Americas residential or is it more broad-based? And I know you've been talking about share gains, are they actually accelerating? David Gitlin : Yes. We did get share in -- if I think about U.S. resi, we've gotten about 120 bps of share on a 12-month roll. So to see orders up over 100% is obviously significant. But as Patrick said, if you take out orders that were a little bit beyond our lead time that go into 4Q, they still would have been up about 60%. So really good order trends that we're seeing in resi that position us well for that high-single digit, maybe 10% or so growth for this year for resi. When we look at commercial HVAC, it was strong, particularly in the Americas and in Europe. Commercial HVAC was up over 40% in the Americas, up close to 20% in EMEA and Asia Pac it was up low-single digits. And a lot of that was data centers, but some other verticals remain strong there as well, things like higher edge and health care have been strong for us. And K-12 has been particularly strong. And that helped us in light commercial, where we saw the first positive orders there that we've seen in some time. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color. David Gitlin : Thanks, Andy. Operator : One moment for the next question. The next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. David Gitlin : Hey, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Hey Dave, can you just -- hi, can you just elaborate on this comment about the preorders into the back half? Is this some kind of jockeying happening, pre-buy happening on the A2L conversion or really kind of what's behind that and why you're calling that out? David Gitlin : No. It's just because I do think our distributors are trying to figure out what they want on the shelf at the end of this year, leading into next. And with our -- we put in place a fairly disciplined PSYOP process. So all that really is, is just talking to them about reality. What do you guys feel like you need this year and then we can plan our factories accordingly. So it's all about production planning. Jeffrey Sprague : And then on the Fire & Security margins, I think, obviously, selling the Lenel business is mix negative beyond has only gone for a month. But that's just a surprisingly strong margin performance. Maybe you could just elaborate, Patrick, on what was going on there? Was there some one-offs happening or kind of something else unusual in the quarter on F&S margins? Patrick Goris : In essence, it was very strong performance on both price and productivity in that segment. And so compared to last year, our margins, obviously, were significantly weaker. They were below 15%. This was just a quarter where price productivity, very strong compared to last year. We had a few negative one-offs last year. Also, of course, we're doing a lot of work related to stranded costs, some of that benefits in that segment as well. Jeffrey Sprague : All right. Sam must be doing a good job in his new role. I'll pass it there. Thanks. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Sam. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just a first question for Patrick perhaps. I just wanted to clarify the third quarter commentary. It sounded like sort of $0.80 of earnings versus maybe we look sequentially, it's easier versus $0.87 you just printed. The revenue number sounded like it was down maybe $100 million sequentially, but -- so it implies a sort of a very large sequential margin drop, unless there's something moving around a lot below the line. So any sort of clarity on that, please? Patrick Goris : Yes. Julie, a couple of comments there. The -- we expect margins to be down about 100 bps, maybe a little bit more in Q3 versus the prior year. The way you can think about it is Viessmann will remain a dilutive impact. With the exits, we're losing about $100 million of operating profit and then tax represents about a $0.06 headwind as well. And so all of that is offset by some volume pickup and then price and productivity. That continues to be strong. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And then just maybe switching back, Dave, to Viessmann. So I understand you have the second half sort of half-on-half bounce in line with normal seasonality. Just sort of following up on that, is the right way to think about it that you're assuming that year-on-year Viessmann is sort of flattish exiting this year in the fourth quarter? Just trying to understand kind of how you think it looks entering next year? And maybe I missed it, but was there an updated operating margin assumption for Viessmann for the year now? David Gitlin : Yes. I think when we look at 4Q, we'll be -- our expectation is we'll be flattish to 4Q of last year. It might be up 1% or so. Patrick Goris : Yes. We expect Q4 sales to be flat year-over-year and the outlook for margins for the full-year now, Julian, is about mid-teens for EBITDA and a few points below that for operating margin. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Got it. Thank you. David Gitlin : With a better EBITDA in 4Q than 3Q as you'd expect. Patrick Goris : Yes, the exit rate is clearly higher. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Thanks. Good to hear on the progress around resi and commercial fire divestiture. Just curious on the timing between expected agreements and the actual exit. It seems a little bit tighter than some of the divestitures that you've previously executed. So just help us understand what would kind of drive that relatively condensed time frame? David Gitlin : It's going to most likely go to a sponsor. So we don't see any real regulatory issues. So we think the time between sign and close should be pretty brief. Patrick Goris : Yes. And it's something we've seen similar for industrial fire. David Gitlin : Yes, same amount of time we saw there. Noah Kaye : That's very helpful. And then just again to clarify on the resi side with the longer lead orders. Maybe you can talk to your updated expectations around the mix of 410A versus 454 for the year. I think that would help us better understand what some of these buying dynamics look like? David Gitlin : Yes, we think there's going to be lower 454B this year than we had previously said. We thought it could be closer to 20%. I think it's going to be less than 10%, maybe closer to 5% this year. I don't think a lot of our distributors and dealers are in a major rush to put in the 454B. We have our initial units out there. We're starting with the residential new construction piece because they're not going to want mixed developments. But we think that as you get into next year, it's probably closer to 80% will be maybe a bit more than that 454B, but probably only about 5% this year. Noah Kaye : Very helpful. Thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joseph Ritchie : Hey, good morning guys. David Gitlin : Hey, Joe. Joseph Ritchie : Hey Dave, maybe just -- it's really encouraging to see that progress with the data center orders. And so maybe talk a little bit more about what's driving that progress. And then secondly, I know that you're planning to increase your North America content as well to sell into that vertical. And so just any update on that would be helpful. David Gitlin : Sure. I mean we are very enthusiastic about the data center opportunity. It's actually the first time that we put together an entire program team led by Christian Sanu [ph] here with a dedicated team focused just on this vertical, whether it's operations, technical, aftermarket support, everything we need to do to not only secure the orders, but then equally, if not more importantly, is support our customers. So we had a big order in 2Q that we had mentioned and with the same customer, they actually ended up adding a bit more to it. We are in discussions with the other hyperscalers and colos. We have the technical offerings that we're very encouraged by and our customers are very encouraged by. I can tell you for one customer, they gave us some technical requirements that we beat. They gave us more significant technical requirements, which we then beat again. So technically, I couldn't be more proud of our engineering team and operationally, we're ramping up. We have facilities in Asia and Europe. Here in the United States, we're going to put max capacity into our Charlotte, North Carolina facility, adding capacity, multiple shifts to that. And we're building out our Mexico facility to add both air cooled and water cool chiller capacity there. So a really exciting opportunity here. We're going to win more than our fair share. And then excitingly, we're starting to build up our whole aftermarket strategy with a very unique dedicated aftermarket offering that we're going to be offering to these critical customers. Joseph Ritchie : Yes, that's all really great to hear. I guess my follow-up question, Patrick, I don't know if I missed it earlier, but did you guys give an update to your light commercial expectations for the year? And then given that orders have kind of turned positive in that business, are you guys feeling better about that business more broadly. I know there's been some concern that you see that business start to fall off a little bit. David Gitlin : Yes, Patrick and I are pointing at each other who takes it. We feel good about light commercial. I mean, we tend to -- my experience over the last two years is we tend to beat what we say we're going to do. But look, in the first quarter, we were up 20%. In the second quarter, we were up 10%. On the full-year, we're saying up low-single-digits. I think we came into the year saying down mid or so. So I think we're balanced in the second half. The verticals that have been good remain good. K-12 is still a unique opportunity. Some of the value-based retail, health care, quick-serve restaurants are still good. We see things that are soft, continue to be soft like warehouse and office space. So it's an area that we've had great technical offerings, great share gains over time. The team is performing well. We think we're calibrated for the year instead of low-single-digits, could it be up mid perhaps we'll have to see how it plays out. But continued strength, and I was happy to see that we had positive orders in the quarter. Our orders in Q2 where the first positive orders quarter we've had in something like five quarters, which was up about 5%, which was encouraging. Patrick Goris : And compared to the prior guide, Joe, the swing in revenue for light commercial was a little less than $100 million. So from down low single-digit prior guide to now up low-single-digits. So it's a big swing that helps offset some other areas. Joseph Ritchie : Nice, thanks guys. Patrick Goris : Thanks, Joe. Operator : And the next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on the orders. That's quite eye-popping growth. Just Patrick, I thought maybe a few more details perhaps on sort of the second half -- on that 3Q margin, I think you said 100 basis points lower Q-over-Q. Maybe just some color on the HVAC margins because that's obviously been very strong. And then on the Viessmann second half, it looks like the exit rate implies maybe down 20% in 3Q. I just want to make sure that's correct with EBITDA for the full-year of about 550, I just want to make sure we've got those right. Patrick Goris : Yes, I'll start with the second part of your question, Nigel. So your EBITDA number is in the ballpark for VCS for the full-year. And we do expect Q3 sales to be down high teens and then Q4 to be about flat year-over-year from a revenue growth point of view for Viessmann Climate Solutions. In terms of margins for the third quarter, and I think you were specifically about -- you asked specifically about HVAC. We continue to see strong productivity that's almost -- that's over 150 bps of margin. The VCS acquisition, however, offsets that. And besides that, we see some larger investments and some currency that take us about to 100 bps lower margin for HVAC year-over-year in Q3. Nigel Coe : Okay, thanks. David Gitlin : And then I'm sorry. Nigel Coe : Please go ahead. David Gitlin : Yes, 3Q, you're right. It would be down high teens and then 4Q would be flattish. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks, David. And then my fourth question, sorry. I'm sorry. On the second half -- I didn't mean to interrupt you, Dave, sorry about that. Follow-up question is really around the order strength in HVAC. It does look like there's a prebuy building here in the fourth quarter. It seems like distributors want to have the 410A products, which implies a prebuy. So just wondering sort of like maybe just some more color in terms of like what you're hearing from the channel because it does feel given that one year kind of install window that there should be a fairly meaningful pre-buy here. Just curious on your thoughts there. David Gitlin : Yes, just Nigel, just not clear how much yet. I think will the distributors go into next year with 410 on the shelf for sure. Exactly how much I think at the end of the day, it won't be that material to either this year or next year. But I do think they're starting to figure out exactly how much do they want going into next year because I think they know and the end customers know that it's going to be a 10% -- just 10% to 15% base price increase. But at the end of the day, with the guide that we've given for today, it assumes just a very modest prebuy. Nigel Coe : Okay, thanks Dave. That's helpful. David Gitlin : Thank you. Thanks, Nigel. Operator : The next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Your line is open. Tommy Moll : Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. David Gitlin : Hey, Tommy. Patrick Goris : Good morning, Tommy. Tommy Moll : Dave, a couple of follow-ups there on A2L. Can you -- correct me if I'm wrong here, you just mentioned the 10% to 15% base price increase. But I think that continues to sync up well with the 15% to 20% cumulative increase you've talked to before. Is that correct? David Gitlin : That's correct, Tommy. Yes, 15% to 20% over two years. Now that 15% to 20% includes our annual price increase, call it, a few percent a year. So the best -- the rest of that would be just the base price increase on the 454B, which is appropriate. I think that we're doing it. I know it seems like I've heard that just in these public calls that our peers are doing it, and it just seems like it's appropriate and that it will stick. Tommy Moll : Thank you. Follow-up question for you on the repurchase. With the sizable $1 billion you've now announced for the second half, you've got good visibility to closing the last divestiture by the end of the year. Without putting an exact time line around it, my question is, is it reasonable to think that if all goes according to plan by the end of next year, all of the Viessmann dilutive shares could be taken back out of the float. Is that a reasonable bogey? David Gitlin : Yes. Tommy Moll : Great. Thank you and I'll turn it back. David Gitlin : Thanks, Tommy. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey, good morning guys. David Gitlin : Hey, Jeff. Good morning. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey, just wanted to come back to like the organic growth bridge in HVAC. A lot of good numbers, but maybe the whole is the weakness you're seeing in China and Europe. So maybe if you can bridge that and then just talk about what you see from a visibility in those markets going forward. Patrick Goris : Yes. If I look at the second quarter growth for HVAC, as I mentioned, I think in my comments, the Americas continued to do quite well with mid-single-digit growth. With the strongest growth there in light commercial and then in commercial HVAC. In EMEA, the growth is a little bit lower, and it's low-single-digits there. And then you have two phenomena : Commercial HVAC, also driven by data centers continues to grow pretty well, mid-teens year-over-year. And then residential and light commercial. And obviously, we see that more broadly in Europe. Residential and light commercial, where we have a business that counts towards organic is down mid-teens. And so that's kind of the dichotomy there in that region. And then Asia-Pacific, frankly is very much all about China, where China is down about mid-teens, and that's a reflection of what we see there in the broader market, including in residential and light commercial. So that's kind of an overview that of overall HVAC organic growth by region in Q2. And we expect that, of course, to pick up in the second half of the year. As we expect resi growth rates to pick up, we think the Americas will be up double-digits in the second half. EMEA and Asia-Pacific both expect to be up about high single digits in the second half of the year. Operator : Excuse me. It does look like that participant tend to last some want to move on to the next question. David Gitlin : We can move on. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Hey, good morning. David Gitlin : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question. I mean, clearly, data centers are making an impact. Just can you just talk to us as a data center technology evolves, right? We're sort of hearing a lot that some technology changes, sort of air cooled versus water cool centrifugal versus scroll. Can you just sort of elaborate a little bit where do you think technology is going long-term? And what products do you have right now? And you talked about adding capacity, what are the products that you're targeting to add capacity in the data center vertical? Thank you. David Gitlin : Yes. For almost the entirety of the market, depending on -- regardless of what hyperscaler or colo you're talking about, we have the technology. We have a really broad range of offerings both on water cool in Europe and a little bit more on the air cooled side. But when you look at chillers, we have the technology, and we're adding capacity for both water cooled and air cooled in places like Charlotte and in Mexico to support the customers. I think longer term, what you're looking at is going to be the need for more liquid cooling. So we're in the middle of development for CDUs, coolant distribution units. We have a lot of the capabilities in-house to do many elements of the CDUs and also the air assisted liquid cooling units. We can do those as well. And we're offering some level of hybrid offerings between traditional and liquid cooling for customers today. And in terms of future direct to chip, we have partnership with STL, we have an investment. We're working closely with them. That's a really impressive startup that has a number of former Dell employees that we're working with. And we're also doing a lot of organic development in-house on liquid cooling. But liquid cooling is not a replacement, it's an and. And I think that combination is going to play right to our strengths. Andrew Obin : Thank you. And just from a regulatory standpoint, [indiscernible] is running out. Where are we in terms of sort of your customers still applying for funding before the deadline? And when do you think we're finally going to start running into tougher comps in education? David Gitlin : Well, it's hard to say because as of right now, the funds need to be committed by September of this year, but there's still $40 billion remaining on $190 billion. So we do know that many have applied for extensions to that. And then the funding itself under the current legislation has to be spent by March of 2026. So we still have some time. And we know that there's 30 or so states that have applied for extensions to be able to spend that money well after March of 2026. So this has been a really strong vertical for us. We continue to see strength in orders. There's a lot of funding to be spent. Probably an extension on the front end and probably an extension on the back end. Andrew Obin : Great answer. Thank you so much. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Your line is open. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning all. David Gitlin : Good morning, Brett. Brett Linzey : I wanted to come back to pricing. So you're seeing some puts and takes in some of the metals trends, nonmaterial inflation probably still higher. Is there a need to go back out this year with price? Or are you pretty well set both in HVAC and the other businesses? Patrick Goris : I think we're pretty much that they're part of our business where we do annual price increases. And if needed, we do more. That's more on the resi side. I don't expect anything there at this point this year. On different parts of the business like commercial HVAC, where they're really project-by-project, the pricing can be a little bit more dynamic. On the -- what you were mentioning on the commodities, obviously, we've seen copper run up a little bit earlier this year, but it's come down quite a bit. So still probably a few pennies of a headwind compared to prior guide, but we are absorbing that with other parts of our business. Brett Linzey : All right. Great. Got it. And then just thinking about the divestitures, I guess, as you guys look to disentangle these businesses upon close. Is there anything to think about in terms of stranded costs or excess that needs to get worked down? And then maybe what are some of the actions you're taking there? Patrick Goris : Yes. So you're absolutely right. And so we're very focused on ensuring we eliminate any of these stranded costs and you may recall that earlier this year, I think at the February call, we mentioned that we proactively executed an $80 million cost reduction program to get ahead of it. That is all happening. We're doing additional actions on top of that. Some of that, you see, of course, already reflected in our margins before some of these businesses exit, but it is absolutely our intention to ensure that our overhead structure is aligned with a simpler, more focused company that we're basically transforming into. It also means that G&A will be less than '24 and beyond than it was, say, in '20 and '21. And so the S maybe up, but the G&A, we expect to be lower, and that's where we're heading. Brett Linzey : All right. Best of luck. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Stephen Tusa : Hey, good morning. Patrick Goris : Good morning, Steve. David Gitlin : Good morning, Steve. Stephen Tusa : Could we just get a little more info on -- so these resi orders are huge. How do you, A, I would assume July is looking pretty good as well. I've heard that the cutoff date kind of extended a bit into July. Maybe the cutoff date was June 30, I'm not sure. But maybe like what do you see from orders and sales perspective for resi in 3Q and 4Q given these like still pretty gigantic orders even without the preordering. David Gitlin : Yes. We don't have a cutoff date, Steve. So we haven't formally said that you can no longer order 410A past a certain date. What we did is we just asked our distributors, look, we got to get a sense of how you're thinking about how much 410A you want for the year. So please start giving us a sense of that. So I would tell you the orders surprised us. They worked very strong in 2Q, I think what we said is if you take out the orders that we got for 4Q that normally would have come later in 3Q, they were still up 60%. Now I will tell you that when we look at the second half of the year, we are very well booked for the second half of the year on the resi side. So if you look at the sales guide up high-single-digits, you're still looking -- we have an easy compare as we get into 4Q, but we still see very strong growth as we get into sales in 4Q, partly because of the order book, partly because the inventory levels out there are very low. They're down a little over 10% year-over-year. And it's nice to see sell-in, sell-out is about equal. So any kind of debate over destocking, we feel confident that's behind us. And I would say on the 454B side, the team has done a great job de-risking that. I would say by the end of the third quarter, we will have produced our first units for every single model that we have. So we've tried to get very much out in front of that, but there has been a lot of strength. I'm sure weather helped a bit, but very strength -- very good strength in orders here in 2Q. Stephen Tusa : So you said up high singles for the year for resi, basically and then we can kind of figure out the comps for 2Q and 3Q. Is that right? David Gitlin : Yes. That's what we said for the year. It's much higher in 4Q year-over-year than in 3Q. It's probably very strong multi-double-digit growth in 4Q and probably high-single-digit in 3Q. But I would say, Steve, the high-single-digits, if it's not 8% or 9%, it could be 10%, it's kind of -- there's just a lot of strength in the system, and we're going to have to see how the second half plays out. But yes, as you said, July has been good. Stephen Tusa : And then just one on the data center stuff. What percentage now do you expect it to be a sales exiting the year? And where are we, do you think, in the continuum of like the pipeline you see building, like your orders are obviously up a lot. If the total is up that much. The orders are obviously up a lot -- how much is -- just give us context around the order growth versus the pipeline growth and the timing of those orders you expect to come out of the pipeline, like where are we in a baseball analogy, what inning are we in on that? David Gitlin : Yes. Let me take the first one first, which is you can think about it, if you think about our new portfolio after we've completed our divestitures, overall commercial HVAC is about 25% of Carrier NewCo, and data centers are a little over 10% of that today. Next year, it's going to be closer to 15% on a higher base. So the absolute value, of course of data centers is increasing exponentially. If you look at orders this year, it's going to -- we have more orders for data centers through the first half than we had for all of last year. So our bookings have been very strong as we enter 2025, we should go into next year with an extremely strong backlog on commercial HVAC overall. It would be our -- next year would be our fifth year in a row of double-digit CHVAC growth, and a lot of that is coming from data centers. When I look at -- we get the question on how long can this continue? We're in the very, very early innings. I mean I think if you think about the hyperscalers, we've had some great wins, but we are currently bidding on a whole lot more. So I don't know if we're in the first or second inning, but it's certainly not the fourth. And the other very, very -- if you think out many years, the aftermarket is going to be significant. If you think about a typical building having three water cooled chillers in it, and now we may have data centers with 80, you think about failure is not an option. They can have no downtime. We're looking at really hyperscale type agreements with parts, with real-time monitoring, technicians on site. So we're thinking about solutions for our hyperscale customers that are very unique that should position us for growth for many years after the initial sales. Stephen Tusa : Great. Thanks a lot for the color. David Gitlin : Thanks, Steve. Operator : And the next question comes from Sahil Manocha with RBC. Your line is now open. Deane Dray : Hey, good morning. Actually it's Deane Dray. And can I add my congrats to Sam? David Gitlin : Yes. Thanks, Deane. Deane Dray : All right. Dave, a couple of moving pieces in the competitive landscape recently. You've got Bosch now as a competitor and Lennox announced saying this JV with Samsung with a focus on heat pumps. Any changes at the margin that you see competitively on these moves? David Gitlin : No, all good competitors, and I don't see any material change to the landscape. Bosch buying JCI's business, Bosch is a great competitor. They're a rational competitor. So we don't see any concerns or issues there? And then in terms of the Lennox, Samsung partnership focus on [indiscernible] and heat pumps, that's a nice combination and both are great competitors. So we don't see a change there. I could tell you, I could not be more proud of our resi team. The margins have been great. The growth has been great. The share gains have been great, the new technology, de-risking the 454B transition, introducing differentiated products. So I love our team. I love the way they're performing, and we have great competitors, and I don't see any real change to that. Deane Dray : All good to hear there. And then any update on the mega projects, just kind of line of sight, bid activity, any color there would be helpful. David Gitlin : Yes. We talk a lot about data centers. But between the CHIPS Act and some of these mega projects, we're positioned very well there. I mentioned that dedicated program team. It's not just data centers. It also includes the mega projects. And so our sales force, we have dedicated folks focused on the hyperscalers, the colos and the mega projects. We've had some very important activity in the bid process with some major ones. We've had some key wins as well, and we'll continue at that one. And hopefully, more to announce there, but the team is working it very well. Deane Dray : Great, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna : Hey, good morning. David Gitlin : Good morning. Patrick Goris : Hey, Gautam. Gautam Khanna : I had a couple of quick ones. First, any evidence of trade downs by consumers opting for repair over replacement, Lennox made a remark about that yesterday. David Gitlin : No, we have not seen -- we watch it super carefully, and we have not seen customers opting to repair instead of replaced, no real material trend there. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And maybe you covered this and I joined late, the VCS kind of maybe the components, what you're seeing between the various business lines you mentioned what's going on in Germany, but in the other product lines, just broadly outside of heat pumps, what you're seeing what are your expectations? David Gitlin : Yes. I mean I think what we've been seeing is heat pumps has been down quite a bit year-over-year, if we look at 2Q, we start to see a recovery as we get into 4Q on heat pumps, but boilers has been down quite a bit, too, which has been a bit of surprising. I think the big one, which is probably kind of good news, bad news is that we don't want to see solar PV down, but that's been down the most. So that was down something like 60% in Q2, it's probably down around 40% for the full-year. And again, that comes with lower margins and things like heat pumps and boilers. So we're not thrilled about it, but we'd rather have that be down than some of the higher-margin heat pumps and boilers. Now the good news is that Thomas and the team have been driving mid-teen aftermarket growth, both in 1Q and 2Q. So I have to give that team credit. It's always easy to show leadership when you have huge market tailwind. Leadership really steps up when markets turn against you for a short period of time. And that's what we've seen. But Thomas has been in that team, controlling the controllables, driving aftermarket growth, taking costs out, revenue synergies, that will end up being in the hundreds of billions of dollar range. So the uniqueness of this combination are going to withstand the test of time. So is it the right company, the right market, the right combination to be sure, and we're taking the challenges we see in the market head-on this year. And we're going to be very poised for growth as we come out of this year. So we'll take our medicine this year and come out super strong next year. Gautam Khanna : Thank you. Operator : Okay. And the last question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Your line is now open. Damian Karas : Hey, good morning everyone. David Gitlin : Hey, Damian. Damian Karas : Just following up on some of the prior HVAC order comments. We had heard that one of your North American competitors was having some notable supply hiccups. So I was wondering if maybe you could just talk more broadly about any industry supply issues that are out there and to what extent that might be impacting the strong orders growth and the 120 basis points of share gains you called out? David Gitlin : We hear anecdotal things as well. But I'd rather not talk about the competitors and just talk about our customers and our team, which is that our teams -- as I mentioned, we picked up about 120 bps over the last 12 months. Our goal is having the right products at the right price when they need, what they need. And I'm confident that if we continue to do the right thing for our customers, we'll continue to see outsized growth. Damian Karas : Terrific. Appreciate it. Thanks for your time. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. David Gitlin : Okay. Well, listen, thank you all for joining us this morning. We're very pleased with the first half of this year, we're positioned well for a strong second half. '24 is a really important year for us as a team as we finalize the transition of our portfolio, and we position ourselves for sustained growth and margin expansion for years to come. So we appreciate you joining us, Sam and the team, of course, are available for questions throughout the day. And thank you again for your confidence in us. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations and CFO of the Fire & Security segment. Please go ahead, sir. Samuel Pearlstein : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. The company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Before turning the call over to Dave, please turn to Page 3. And with the commercial and residential fire businesses qualifying as held-for-sale during the third quarter, the Fire & Security segment in aggregate, met the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. Historical sales margins and earnings per share are in the appendix on Page 27 and 28 to help for comparisons to help you interpret the results, continuing operations include the HVAC segment, the Refrigeration segment, including commercial refrigeration and the corporate expenses and eliminations guidance now includes the corporate expenses that were previously allocated to the Fire & Security segment as well as the controls business that was part of the Fire & Security segment. Results discussed on this call will be continuing operations only with the exception of preliminary free cash flow unless stated otherwise. Once the call is open for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And with that, I'd turn -- I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin. David Gitlin : Well, thank you, Sam. And let me start by saying a heartfelt thanks to you for everything that you have done for Carrier over the past five years. We wish you the best as the CFO of the Commercial and Residential Fire business. I'd also like to welcome Mike Rednor who will succeed Sam and join Carrier on November 4. Our team continues to perform while we put the finishing touches on our transformation. Organic orders were up 20% -- above 20% compared to last year, and we continue to increase our backlog, positioning us for continued growth as we head into 2025. The team drove 4% organic sales growth by leaning into verticals of strength to help offset continued headwinds in residential and light commercial HVAC in Europe and China. Importantly, we delivered double-digit aftermarket growth, and we are on a path for our fourth year in a row of double-digit growth. Organic sales growth, combined with productivity drove very strong core earnings conversion of about 40%. We repurchased roughly $400 million worth of shares in Q3. And with our new reauthorization, we expect to repurchase approximately $5 billion worth of shares between the second half of this year and the end of next year. We had said that we wanted 2025 to be a clean year. We are on track to do just that. We closed on the sale of the commercial refrigeration business on October 1, and we are on track to close on our final divestiture commercial and residential fire by year-end. In addition to completing our portfolio moves, we have reached settlement subject to court approvals that we are confident will largely put the inherited AFFF potential exposure behind us. We're pleased with the outcome, which Patrick will discuss in more detail. Turning to Slide 5. Our vision remains unwavering to be the global leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions. Global leadership entails winning and winning the right way through differentiation and customer solutions. We have gained share in nearly every business. In commercial HVAC, we are achieving outsized growth in key verticals, including data centers, decarbonization-related infrastructure spend and mega projects. For example, we had a recent win for a new semiconductor fab facility on the West Coast of the United States. In data centers, our orders year-to-date are up more than 3x, and we expect continued momentum. Data center equipment growth will drive aftermarket growth where there is a 5x to 10x multiplier opportunity versus the installed base over time. Our commercial HVAC business is far better positioned now than it has ever been. Everything connected, everything intelligent. In Q3, we connected an additional 5,000 new chillers in the field and are on track for 50,000 connected chillers by year-end. We also continue to expand our overall number of connected devices and offerings for our Abound and Lynx Digital platforms. Climate is at our core as a company. We achieved the U.S. Department of Energy's cold climate heat pump challenge by validating that our Infinity variable speed heat pumps with dream speed intelligence can operate in the field at 100% capacity at 0 degrees Fahrenheit and reliably at negative 13 degrees Fahrenheit. We also introduced a new version of the Vector Trailer Refrigeration unit, which will reduce CO2 emissions by 73% while maintaining best-in-class performance. With our increased investments and expanded HVAC portfolio, we are now running a year or two ahead of our goal to reduce our customers' carbon emissions by one gigaton by 2030. On energy, we are focused on introducing complete home energy management solutions. In Europe, we remain confident in the sustained transition from boilers to heat pumps where we see a mix-up factor of more than 3 :1. Adding integrated solar PV and battery can more than double the mix-up factor. In North America, we are making great progress working with major utilities validating that our technology can help them manage peak hour demand which would also result in savings for our customers. We will be introducing pilots into the field this next year. And finally, on solutions. Our aftermarket growth formula continues to yield results. Coverage for our chillers is about 75,000 units, and we remain on track for more than 80,000 by the end of this year. Our aftermarket playbook continues to gain traction across the portfolio. As we look ahead, there is no question that we are a new Carrier, as you can see on Slide 6. In just the four years since our spin, our HVAC business revenues will have nearly doubled from $10 billion in 2020. We are focused and simpler and now positioned as a higher growth profile company with our complete portfolio exposed to sustainability-related secular talents. In addition, we have leading positions in all our targeted HVAC-R markets globally to help us drive consistent profitable growth through geographic and vertical cycles. Turning to Slide 7. I am very excited about the benefits that focus will bring. Since our spin, we have made great progress on culture, talent, winning, innovation, customer centricity, growth and margin expansion. We have done this while navigating COVID supply chain challenges and a significant portfolio transformation. With that behind us, our portfolios going forward are clear. Laser focus on our customers and share and margin gains in our core businesses, double-digit aftermarket growth, complete ecosystem solutions for our customers and continued balanced capital deployment. I am so excited for 2025 as we can double down on our focus on execution and growth, benefiting our customers, our people and our shareholders. Last, before I turn it over to Patrick, a few words on Viessmann Climate Solutions on Slide 8. For the first time this year, we are seeing encouraging market indications. The backlog, which was still elevated coming into the year, is now back to traditional levels. So this business has returned to being a book and ship business with about a month of backlog. Orders for much of the year in Germany were constrained in large part because the government declared in February that subsidies would not be paid until October. We thought orders would start to pick up in Q3, which they did just later in the quarter than we anticipated. Therefore, Q3 sales were down about 25% rather than our estimated 20%, resulting in the full-year expectation now being down in the high teens rather than our previous estimate of down in the mid-teens. Encouragingly, recent trends around orders and subsidy applications have improved. Heat pump subsidy applications in Germany in Q3 were up about 50% sequentially and up 2x versus last year. VCS orders overall turned positive, up low-single-digits, and it was the best quarter in over -- best orders quarter in over a year. Orders were up about 10% in September, and that strength has continued in October. More broadly, the integration has exceeded our expectations. There are so many obvious and some less obvious benefits to this game-changing combination. Consider technology development and now having best of the best approaches to scalable global platforms. We are now harmonizing our electronic control board designs around the Viessmann platform. Cost per board is projected to decrease significantly and we will also benefit from avoiding duplication across the network supply chain management, obsolescence management and quality. The same is true for our embedded software. We will be harmonizing standard embedded software for all of our electronics around the Viessmann One-based ecosystem, which will shorten time to market and decrease development costs. We are also working on implementing best of the best digital connectivity with our customers. For revenue synergies, we are targeting over $100 million in revenue synergies next year. These include new Carrier cooling and heat pump offerings through the Viessmann channel and a new Carrier-branded propane heat pump for light commercial applications. And we know we will drive cost synergies. We remain on track for over $200 million in cost synergies in 2026. And of course, we are driving internally to do better than that. By controlling the controllables and leveraging this phenomenally differentiated company, I am confident that we will together drive tremendous value for decades to come. With that, I will turn it over to Patrick. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking some of my colleagues in the corporate finance team. So far this year, the team has successfully integrated Viessmann Climate Solutions financials, manage the accounting for five different exit transactions and more recently, has transitioned our financial statements back to 2022 to reflect disc ops treatment for the Fire & Security exits. Just one of those moving pieces would be a big project. The combination of all of these in less than a year is truly an enormous and complex undertaking. So a big thank you to our Chief Accounting Officer, Kyle Crockett, our Tax and Treasury lead Mike Cenci and our Corporate Planning and IR leads, Gen [indiscernible] and Sam Pearlstein as well as their entire teams. Very much appreciate it. Please turn to Slide 9. A reminder that with the exception of preliminary free cash flow, all these results refer to continuing operations. Reported sales of $6 billion were up 21% with organic sales up 4%. Viessmann Climate Solutions contributed 17% to year-over-year sales growth. Q3 adjusted operating profit of over $1 billion was up 19% compared to last year, driven by the contribution of Viessmann Climate Solutions, the benefit of organic growth and price and productivity. Adjusted operating margin was down 40 basis points. The consolidation of Viessmann Climate Solutions represented about 130 basis point headwind to adjusted operating margin in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted operating margin is up 120 basis points, driven by the benefit of organic growth and strong productivity. As Dave already mentioned, core earnings conversion that is excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency was about 40% in the quarter and over 100% year-to-date. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.77 was up 3% year-over-year, driven by organic growth, price and productivity, partly offset by higher net interest expense, a higher tax rate and higher share count. We have included the year-over-year adjusted EPS from continuing operations bridge in the appendix on Slide 22. Including the $0.06 adjusted EPS from discontinued operations, overall adjusted EPS of $0.83 was better than our guide by about $0.03. Q3 Fire & Security sales now excluded from our reported results were about $500 million. Preliminary free cash flow for the company, which includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations, was an outflow of about $370 million in the quarter. This figure includes roughly $1.1 billion of cash taxes on the business exit gains, transaction costs and restructuring costs resulting in preliminary underlying free cash flow performance in the quarter of about $700 million. On a year-to-date basis, preliminary free cash flow is $120 million with preliminary underlying performance of about $1.4 billion. Moving on to the segments, starting on Slide 10. HVAC reported sales growth of 26% reflects organic sales growth of 6% and the contribution of Viessmann Climate Solutions. Organic sales in the Americas were up high-single-digits, driven by an almost 20% increase in commercial HVAC and double-digit sales growth for residential HVAC. Light commercial was down mid-single-digits. Organic sales in EMEA were up low-single-digits, driven by double-digit growth in commercial HVAC partially offset by a decline in resi and light commercial sales, reflecting continued market weakness in that segment. Sales in Asia-Pacific were down low-single-digits, driven by continued weakness in our residential and light commercial markets in China, partially offset by continued strength in the Rest of Asia. The HVAC segment operating margins were down 100 basis points as we expected. The benefit of organic growth and productivity were offset by the consolidation of VCS, which represented about a 200 basis point margin headwind in the quarter. Overall, another solid quarter for HVAC. Transitioning to Refrigeration on Slide 11. A reminder that commercial refrigeration results are included in continuing operations as they do not qualify for disc ops treatment. Reported and organic sales were up 1%. Transport refrigeration was up 3%. Within transport, container was up 30% year-over-year, while global truck and trailer was down mid-single digits, driven by North America truck and trailer, which was down over 15%. European truck and trailer was down low single-digits, while Asia truck and trailer continues to perform very well with about 20% growth. Our Sensitech business was up double-digits. Commercial refrigeration was down low-single-digits. Q3 is the last quarter to include the commercial refrigeration business as we closed the sale transaction on October 1, through three quarters, commercial refrigeration sales were about $750 million with immaterial adjusted operating profit contribution. Adjusted operating margin for this segment expanded 50 basis points compared to last year, driven by productivity. Turning to Slide 12 for orders. In the interest of time, I will just mention a few highlights. Total company orders were up close to 20% on an organic basis. North America resi HVAC orders were up 30% year-over-year, and recent movement has been stronger than we expected. We're not counting on any material 410A prebuy this year. We see continued strength in global commercial HVAC with orders up about 15%. Data centers remain particularly strong, and global truck and trailer orders are up 85% held by a very easy compare. Turning to Slide 13, guidance. Our guidance for 2024 now reflects continuing operations with the exception of free cash flow. There are a few moving pieces, but our new adjusted EPS guide is essentially unchanged compared to the July adjusted EPS guide, except for the impact of discontinued operations. We now expect reported full-year sales of roughly $22.5 billion compared to the prior guide that included Fire & Security with underlying organic growth of about 3%. Our adjusted operating margin guidance remains roughly 15.5%, up 150 basis points year-over-year, and we continue to expect full-year core earnings conversion to be well north of 50%. Our guide for adjusted EPS of continuing operations is now about $2.50. As I mentioned earlier, the change versus our July guide of $2.85 is all related to be transition to disc ops treatment of the Fire & Security exits. In the appendix, we have included a guide-to-guide bridge on Slide 23 as well as on Slide 24, a bridge from what we called core adjusted EPS to the $2.50 guide of continuing operations. As you will recall, we estimated earlier this year that 2024 full-year adjusted EPS of the businesses we are retaining would amount to $2.60. As you will see on the bridge, the difference between the $2.60 and $2.50 adjusted EPS is all related to disc ops. And more specifically, the treatment of costs previously allocated to the Fire & Security segment and net interest expense in disc ops accounting. As I mentioned earlier, commercial refrigeration has an immaterial adjusted EPS contribution in 2024. Hence, it is not included on the bridge. Our free cash flow outlook is now an outflow of $200 million versus an inflow of $400 million in the July guide reflecting about $600 million of cash tax payments related to the business exit of commercial and residential fire. This was not in our July guide given timing of the definitive agreement. Our underlying free cash flow outlook remains about $2.4 billion, and we now expect capital expenditures about -- of about $500 million and cash restructuring closer to $150 million. From a capital structure perspective, we expect to be at about 2x net leverage at the end of the calendar year, consistent with the commitment we made earlier in the year. In the appendix on Slide 26, there is a summary of additional items, which were also updated as part of the new guide. Moving on to Slide 14. While we plan to issue 2025 adjusted EPS guide, when we report earnings in early February, I want to update you on some of the building blocks, starting with our current 2024 guide of $2.50 of adjusted EPS. Consistent with our value creation framework, we expect to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth from organic revenue growth. In addition to that, we expect tailwinds from the elimination of costs previously allocated to the Fire & Security segment. As Sam mentioned, these costs are included in the $2.50 adjusted EPS of continuing ops. We started addressing these costs at the very beginning of calendar 2024, and we'll have eliminated about $200 million of run rate costs throughout 2024 with some residual benefit in 2025, as you can see on this slide. Moving on to an expected tailwind from lower net interest expense. Debt pay down throughout 2024 means that 2025 net interest expense is expected to be a $0.05 to $0.10 tailwind. Finally, we expect second half 2024 and 2025 share repurchases to amount to about $5 billion, eliminating the dilution from shares issued from the VCS acquisition by the end of 2025. In short, given these building blocks, we expect to have another year of strong adjusted EPS growth in 2025. From a capital deployment perspective, we expect to continue to target a growing and sustainable dividend, representing about a 30% payout. We also expect to pay down the $1.2 billion maturity early next year and refinanced the \u20ac750 million debt tranche subject to market conditions. Moving on to Slide 15. At the end of last week, we announced important settlements related to AFFF. Let me start with estate claims or claims that Carrier is responsible for any liabilities of KFI including all those related to the manufacturer or sale of AFFF. Upon court approval, this settlement will permanently resolve all such present and future claims with a water, personal injury, airport or anyone else. Moving on to direct claims, or claims for UTC's actions between 2005 and 2013, when it owned the AFFF business. We believe the settlements will resolve substantially all current and future AFFF-related claims by public water providers and airports. We also believe that any potential remaining claims black [ph] merit. Cash settlement payments amount to $615 million, which we estimate will be paid over time, as you can see on the slide. Importantly, we expect insurance payments received in the aggregate, will cover the full amounts paid by Carrier under the settlements, though timing is not expected to match the timing of outflows in the early years. The settlement enables Carrier to receive up to $2.4 billion from shared insurance recoveries. In addition to the $615 million of cash payments, the settlement also provides that the KFI net sales proceeds of $115 million are contributed. This is a noncash item for Carrier as is the $125 million contribution from insurance recovery. The settlements will not impact our capital deployment plans, including dividends and share repurchases. In short, we had another good quarter. Transformation is substantially behind us, and we are optimistic about 2025 and beyond. With that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open sir. Jeffrey Sprague : Hey, thank you. Good morning everyone. David Gitlin : Good morning. Jeffrey Sprague : Patrick, I don't know at you're going to do with all your spare time now. You've got all this fun and the finance team there. But Dave, on Viessmann, obviously, it's been sort of a moving target here trying to find the bottom. It looks and feels like we're likely there. But can you share your view on kind of what the bottoming process in turn might look like and give us some indication of how you're expecting things to kind of travel from a revenue standpoint into 2025? David Gitlin : Yes, Jeff, it's been -- there have been a lot of moving parts. I feel that with Thomas and the team, we're in a rhythm now of looking and they have been throughout. But we look together at weekly orders, it's really orders translate into sales almost overnight. So we're looking at all the underlying factors and they seem to have now been solid. I mentioned that September orders were quite strong. They were up about 10%. Orders so far, it's only been two or three weeks during October. But so far this month, they've been even stronger than that. So it feels like we've seen some level of turning. Now we are, of course, entering the season and throughout Europe and in Germany, in particular, they're starting to now pay the subsidies. So that could be contributing. We obviously don't feel confident enough that we can call a bottom. But when we look at subsidy applications over the last three months in Germany. We look at the orders that we've been seeing, not only in Germany but throughout VCS, it does feel like we've turned a corner. Jeffrey Sprague : And then just shifting completely to the pre-buy question. I think either you or Patrick said you're not expecting a prebuy. It sounds like one is happening real time. So maybe just elaborate on that and do you have the capacity to meet the demand for 410A prebuy if you're getting that impulse from the channel? David Gitlin : We definitely have the capacity. What we did is we went out to our distributors and said, \"Look, tell us how much you think you're going to need to have on the shelf at the end of this year going into next year because we're going to run out of capacity to produce it\". So we don't look as much at the orders. You saw our very strong orders in 2Q around 100% this quarter, around 30%. So I think some of that had to do with folks having -- wanting some level of 410A on the shelf as we enter into next year, we're looking at sales. What we're trying to do is build the inventory that we think we need going into next year. To determine whether it's a predelivery, which I think is the right word, are you delivering in 2024 for demand that would otherwise occur in 2025? You look at the movement, you look at the underlying demand for our end consumers. So the good news is that movement was strong coming out of 3Q, movement has been very, very strong in October, much higher than we anticipated. So we will enter next year with some level of 410A inventory within Carrier. We think it's for the underlying demand that there will be for the first quarter of next year. But as it looks right now, we don't see any material predelivery of 410A this year. Jeffrey Sprague : Understood. Thank you. David Gitlin : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. David Gitlin : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. First off, I just wanted to circle back to slide sort of 24 and 25. So just trying to understand if you could clarify a little bit more that $0.10 delta sort of what exactly is moving on Slide 24 between the core and the continuing ops guide? And also, I guess, on Slide 25, you have that $0.40 operational tailwinds guided. I think last quarter, that number was about $0.55. So just trying to understand kind of the moving pieces on those two items, please? Patrick Goris : Yes, Julian, good morning. This is Patrick. So the $2.60 on Slide 24 was our estimate of the EPS in 2024 of the businesses that we are retaining. And so that is -- that was our estimate back then. The $2.50 is 2024 according to continuing operations with continuing operations charges that were allocated to the Fire & Security segment from corporate and other functions, unless they were direct charges are allocated to continuing operations. That was not the case in the $2.60 because we looked at $2.60 from a core clean company going forward. So the difference between the $2.60 and the $2.50 is basically allocation of headquarter charges to the segments that we assumed would not be there. The second and that's about $0.05. The other $0.05 is basically how interest expense is treated in disc ops. This explains when you look at our bridge from the $2.50, the building blocks for next year, you'll see that is a $0.05 pickup from disc ops treatments of some of the stranded costs. That's part of the $0.10 you see here. And you also see there is a $0.05 to $0.10 pickup from net interest expense next year versus this year. That also is part of the $0.10 you see here on Slide 24. With that, I'll move over to 25. On 25, again, this is based on the $2.20 continuing operations, the operational performance is an improvement of $0.40 of adjusted EPS. I think you're referring to last quarter, $0.55 of operational performance improvement that included the Fire & Security segment. Of the $0.55 of last quarter, about $0.15 to $0.20 related to Fire & Security. So the core operational performance of our business has been unchanged, current guide versus the prior guide. Julian Mitchell : That's really helpful. Thank you, Patrick. And then maybe just one last clarification one, just on the fourth quarter kind of core assumptions there. It looks like, I think it's about a just under sort of $0.50 or so and you've got about mid-single digit organic growth year-on-year and a mid-teens operating margin. Just wondered if you could flesh out any of the guideposts for fourth quarter on the go-forward basis? Patrick Goris : Yes. The way you can think about it is the mid-single digit organic growth, we expect HVAC to be close to 10% in the quarter with continued strong double-digit growth in commercial HVAC. We also believe that refrigeration will be down about mid-single digits, mostly driven by North America truck and trailer. Adjusted EPS expected to be a little less than 50%, as you mentioned... Julian Mitchell : $0.50. Patrick Goris : A little bit less than $0.50. Yes, what did I say? Julian Mitchell : 50%. Patrick Goris : So less than $0.50. But up about 33% year-over-year, and our operating margin is expected to be up about 300 bps year-over-year, a little bit more than that actually. And so the margin expansion is really outcome of stronger volume and mix, good price and productivity. And actually, in Q4, we expect the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and our margins to be about neutral. Julian Mitchell : That's great. Thank you. Patrick Goris : You're welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. David or Patrick, as we think about the bridge to '25, interestingly, you gave us the 6% to 8% organic growth profile for the new Carrier, which I know it's not a '25 guide per se, but would you say at this point, you have above average visibility of that growth profile in '25, given the double-digit increase in backlog exiting Q3? And then you mentioned core incrementals in Q3 of 40%. I know you've been focused on improved productivity. So can you continue that kind of performance into '25? Patrick Goris : So you're right, Andy. We're not going to provide guidance on this call. But what we -- what I said in my script was that we would expect double-digit EPS growth from organic growth, and that's the first building block. And based on what we see today in our businesses, Commercial HVAC, as you mentioned, very strong performance this year, a big increase in backlog. We continue to see our backlog increase. Residential HVAC, as Dave mentioned earlier, we do not expect a big prebuy this year, maybe a preorder, but not a big prebuy. That business for the last several quarters has returned to growth. And so we have some big elements of our portfolio, and Dave just mentioned about Viessmann as well. We have some big elements of our portfolio that either are returning to growth or continuing to perform quite well. So at this point, we would be very disappointed if at least that first bucket of or first building block for next year if that does not represent double-digit adjusted EPS growth. And on top of that, you can see the benefit of stranded cost elimination, net interest tailwinds and then, of course, the tailwinds from our significant buyback. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. That's helpful. And then just following up on like commercial and residential. Obviously, there seems to be some market share movement. But could you help us separate a bit how much better, for instance, Americas like commercial markets are maybe residential markets versus your initial expectations? I know you have more 410A maybe than competitors. How might that also translate into '25. Forgetting about the prebuy for a second, it seems like there's some market share movement as well. David Gitlin : Yes. Andy, I think on both, we've gained share, both resi and light commercial. Resi more share, our resi share has been -- share gains have been north of 100 bps. I think in part because, yes, we were able to support our customers with the 410A and we may have had a peer or two that we're not as able to do so. What we're watching light commercial, this year has been better than we thought. We thought we'd be down low-single digits, we'll be up low-single digits. And that even assumes Q4 being down something like 15%. Now we'll see what ends up happening. But we're trying to do in Q4 is, number one, continue to support our customers. We've been coming off years of very strong growth, in part due to share gains in part due to new product introductions, some national accounts we've picked up. So I think the good news as we go into next year is that we want to make sure we end this year with balanced inventory. So we've assumed down 15% in Q4, which would have put us up low-single digits for the year. Again, I'm talking light commercial, and for the first time in now a few years, we'll have an easier compare next year than we've had over these last few years. So the team is performing well. I think we'll end up low-single digits there. And on the resi side, hats off to the team. We continue to see high-single digits this year. We've taken share. We've managed the 23 SEER transition very well. We're managing the 454B transition very well. We have the 410A to support our customers, obviously, this year and then probably next year, about 90%, probably more than 90% of our deliveries will be the 454B, which we still expect the benefit of pricing on. So I think that as we go into next year, if we continue to see the kind of movement we've had, inventory levels in the channel are low. They ended up last quarter, down about 10%. We want to make sure we end up this year with balanced inventory. So we feel good about the growth next year in resi for sure. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate all the color. David Gitlin : Thanks, Andy. Operator : And our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. David Gitlin : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Lots going on here. That's for sure. So Patrick, I just wanted to pick up on the 4Q moving pieces. I just want to confirm, 12% adjusted operating margin for 4Q. Maybe just help us on how that divides between the segments and perhaps the below the line just given the core per costs moving around with the discontinuation? Patrick Goris : If I look at operating margin for Q4, I think it's going to be about 12.5% for the overall company. And I mentioned the growth rates earlier between refrigeration and HVAC. I think HVAC margins will be close to 15%, 15.5% and refrigeration about 13% or so in that range. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's helpful. And then you think Viessmann will be another 20 basis points impact there? Patrick Goris : No. Actually, I think the margin impact of Viessmann in Q4 on the overall company will be flat. And on the HVAC segment would be a headwind of about 0.5 point. Nigel Coe : Okay, because of the ramp up sequentially. Okay. And then just on the buyback, you said -- I think the term in the slides is buyback underway. Does that imply that you're already in the market buying back stock? And on that $4.7 billion between now and year end '25, is that -- are you planning regular way buybacks in the open market? Or would you consider some form of an ASR or tender? Patrick Goris : Yes, Nigel. So we repurchased about $400 million in Q3. And our current outlook for this year is about $1 billion, so about $600 million or so more to go this quarter. Depending on the timing of the proceeds from our last exit, which we expect to close by the end of this year, we may decide to do more this calendar year. We are looking at open market purchases as well as an ASR. And so it could be a combination of all of the above. It is not clear yet this year, we will do more than $1 billion. That will mostly depend on the timing of the proceeds and, of course, on market conditions. Nigel Coe : That's very helpful. Thank you. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. David Gitlin : Hey, Deane. Patrick Goris : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey just want to wish Sam best of luck. Thanks for your help, and welcome to Mike. Just first question on data center. A couple of points here. One is, can you elaborate on that 5x multiplier because that's right in the range of what we've been looking at. It's much better to sell HVAC equipment is a data center than a onetime electrical equipment that doesn't have that kind of aftermarket. So what are the assumptions in the 5x multiplier? And Dave, are there differences in the equipment that you're providing to the hyperscalers today, because they require significant redundancy. So are there any complexities in the equipment or how standardized is that as it looks today? David Gitlin : They are -- the equipment can be a bit customized depending on the specific requirements. Obviously, we start with the baseline of our existing water cooled and air cooled chillers, but then they may have unique bespoke requirements and our applied engineering team has done a phenomenal job understanding the specific requirements, especially of the hyperscalers, passing our first-of-kind units with in many cases, exceeding the requirements. And I think we're working very closely with our customers to satisfy the specific requirements. It may be that they have a requirement for operating at very low output levels, capacity requirements, but not having a complete turn off of the chiller are continuing to operate at, say, 5%, so they don't have a complete cold start-up, and our team has been able to manage requirements like that. So generally, more than 80% common, I would say, with our existing chillers, but with some modifications. I would say our team Deane has done a phenomenal job. We've seen great wins. You won't see all of it in our orders, because we may have a commitment from our customers that hasn't made its way into our orders number. But I mentioned orders up 250% year-to-date. We've made great progress not only in the United States with the hyperscalers and for their facilities outside the United States, but with the colos as well, folks like Vantage and others. So we're very pleased with the progress that we've made, and we're very confident in our continued wins. We started this journey with a target of how many chillers that we felt we needed to win to increase share, not only in North America, but globally and support our customers, and our target now is orders of magnitude higher than anything we established upfront. So very, very pleased with the progress. And I think that the aftermarket opportunity is going to be transformational for Carrier in terms of how we think about supporting those customers, but customers in Chicago or Shanghai because we're going to have -- if you picture having anywhere from 50 to 200 chillers at a single site, now you're dealing with a rotable pool, real-time monitoring of the equipment prognostics to anticipate failures, diagnostics, technicians on-site with multi-shifts. So you may have two technicians in the day, two technicians at night. So all hands on deck to support them, and we're going to be pricing it as kind of one of our most elite offerings in kind of a power by the hour type agreement. So very excited about the new wins and the aftermarket opportunity. Again, that won't kick in for a few years, of course, but we believe that will be at least 5x the equipment value. Deane Dray : Great. That's exactly what I was looking for. And then for Patrick, on the -- congrats on the AFFF settlement. I know that's a difficult process and it still needs court approval. What would the circumstances be where you would be able to collect above that 615 has referenced the $2.4 billion. What would the circa, would there have to be new claims filed? How might that play out? David Gitlin : I'll take it, Deane. It's really going to be a function, we have the policies. We have coverage that certainly exceeds the $2.5 billion that Patrick mentioned. So we have the ability to collect more. We just then forego some of the policy. So it will be a function of how we decide to navigate this with the plaintiffs because they have access to the insurance recoveries as well. So look, when we look at it, and I want to thank Kevin O'Connor and the legal team because this was obviously difficult to navigate where we've -- I think we're the only company in the world that can say that we've put the underlying liabilities, we call them the estate claims, because KFI is of course, in bankruptcy. But when we look at the underlying claims associated with the manufacturer sale of AFFF, we have now put those effectively in the rearview mirror subject to final court approval. So we feel really good about that. We feel really good that even on these direct claims, which you would call tenuous at best, these are claims that over a decade ago, something UTC would have done during its ownership of this business that's unrelated to the sale or manufacturing of AFFF. Those are those claims. And we've even settled assuming we get court approval, a big chunk of those. So we feel that between the insurance recovery, the settlements that we've had we can start 2025 with our portfolio transformation behind us, AFFF fundamentally behind us. And now we can just focus on good old-fashioned customers growth, execution, innovation, the real exciting stuff. Deane Dray : Congratulations. Thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Hey, good morning guys. David Gitlin : Hey Joe. Patrick Goris : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : Hey, so real quickly on just the resi for 3Q, 4Q, I know you talked about resi HVAC being up double-digits in the third quarter. I'm curious like how much was it up specifically? And what's embedded in the HVAC up 10% in 4Q for your resi business? David Gitlin : The resi business was up double-digits in the third quarter. And when we look at the fourth quarter, again, we're not assuming that there's a significant -- any kind of prebuy in the number. No, I think -- yes, go ahead. Patrick Goris : Yes. So Q3 was up 11%. And then Q4 is going to be a lot more than that. But frankly, remember last year, Q4 was really weak. And so Q4 is going to be up probably 20%, 30%. But again, that's more of a function of weak last year with the destock rather than us having a lot of prebuy, as we said in our guide, we do not assume a material prebuy. David Gitlin : Yes. Remember, Joe, as Patrick mentioned, we had a pretty easy compare. Last year, it was down about 20% in resi. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's super helpful, guys. And then as you're thinking about the dynamics for next year, Dave, with this SEER transition that's happening, I know you mentioned that 90% of what you're going to sell is going to be R-454B. I guess, like do you have any concerns around the 410A units just perhaps like being, I know you mentioned that like your distributors aren't really stocking in, but basically having enough inventory on hand for the first half of the year, such that the R-454B units are a little bit slower to pick up. And then as you're thinking through pricing specifically for R-454B, I know that you guys are expecting double-digit pricing. But how do you think about the net realized price associated with those units? David Gitlin : Well, on the first piece, yes, we fully expect there to be 410A sold in the first quarter. I think that we'll be selling 410A to our distributors and certainly our distributors will have 410A on the shelf going into next year. So we expect a fair amount of 410A to be sold into distribution and into the market in the first quarter. I think the question that folks are trying to wrestle with is are we selling more 410A this year, pulling from 2025, and we just don't see much of that. Could there be a couple of percent once all the dust settles perhaps, but we just -- it's all a function of the true underlying demand. And the only way we can understand that is by looking at underlying movement, which again has been very strong here in October, and look at the inventory levels that we see in the channel. And again, those have been down 10%, we expect the year to end in balance. So we don't think it's a pull forward, but we certainly expect 410A to be sold a fair amount of it in the first quarter. I think in terms of pricing, we've been very clear that the base price of 454B will be 10% higher than the base price 410A. And then to get to the 15% to 20% over two years, you get escalation. And I think that, that's appropriate. And I think that once our customers and others, I assume, see the underlying cost impact of having to put additional parts into the 454B system and different controls and algorithms to associated with the A2L, I think others will price it however they decide to price it, that's how we've determined it is appropriate for us to price it. And we think that that's going to stick. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks guys. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Stephen Tusa : Hey, good morning. Patrick Goris : Good morning. David Gitlin : Hey, Steve. Stephen Tusa : Sam, thanks again for all the help and best of luck. Samuel Pearlstein : Thank you. Stephen Tusa : So just on this light commercial business, how are you kind of looking at that into next year? And any impact you're seeing from the ESSER cliff? David Gitlin : Well, a little bit early to say next year, Steve. I think our goal right now is to end with inventory levels in balance. That's why we assume down 15% in the fourth quarter of this year. ESSER has been very, very helpful, but that continues. The actual spend associated with ESSER will certainly continue throughout 2025. What happened with ESSER is the $190 billion of ESSER funding is now behind us. There was about $20 billion that I think get returned from the states of the Department of Energy. But that has to be spent. Currently, the requirement is to get spent by March of 2026. So we'll still be continuing to spend on our wins throughout all of next year into the 2026. And there's about 30 states that are looking to extend their spend requirement beyond March of 2026. We've had some really big wins on K-12, in particular, there are states like California and Arizona, where we've had very, very significant wins. So that's been a big part of our success. It's not just K-12, but some of the other verticals. So it's been a good news story for us. I think this year, we'll be up, as I mentioned, low-single digits. Early to say, Steve, exactly what we see for next year. But our whole focus now is, especially on the small rooftop units, making sure inventory levels come down a bit in the channel. Stephen Tusa : That's helpful. And then just for Viessmann, there's a little bit of math required here, which is always a challenge, I guess, early in the morning. But it looks to me to be about, I don't know, like 10% margin for adjusted OP margin for 3Q and then for the year now, you're at like more like 11%. Is that about right for the margins? Patrick Goris : Yes, Steve, for the full-year, 11% is certainly in the ballpark and then EBITDA it's mid-teens actually. Stephen Tusa : Mid-teens EBITDA, but the adjusted OP that's running through your adjusted P&L. Patrick Goris : Yes. As I mentioned [indiscernible] certainly in the ballpark and full-year EBITDA is close to actually mid-teens actually. David Gitlin : We know you'll want to get to the lowest number, Steve. Stephen Tusa : Okay. Thanks a lot guys. Patrick Goris : Yes, thank you Steve. Operator : And our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Thanks, good morning. Could we spend a minute on refrigeration. I think first, can we sort of level set what the margin profile ex CCR looks like just to have a base as we enter '25. Is this sort of like a 14% type or a little bit lower EBIT margin business, since CCR is immaterial? And the second part of the question is, it's good to see orders in truck trailer in flex. So maybe just talk a little bit about the business trends and how those might set up for growth entering '25? David Gitlin : Maybe -- no, let me take the second one first, and Patrick will take the first one. We're not reading anything into the orders numbers that you saw for NATT. There's some easy compares there, we're just looking at the underlying business. It's going to be a tough year for North American truck trailer, because some of the -- we don't think we've necessarily gained or lost any share there, but it's just a tough business for the market. The key for us is to make sure that we close out the year, but really position ourselves for growth next year. We're confident we'll get growth going into next year. ACT has relatively modest growth, I think mid-single digits going into next year. But we have some other things that we want to push to kind of get outsized growth on top of that. But yes, we're -- the orders number was very high, but we're sort of discounting it because of the comparison. Patrick Goris : Yes. And then, Noah, on the first question, this year, refrigeration margins, excluding commercial refrigeration, would be up about 300 basis points, give or take. And then as I mentioned, for Carrier going forward or think Carrier 2025 versus 2024, we will lose $750 million of revenue related to CCR. But basically, as I said, immaterial operating profit. So if you do that math, basically, our operating margin next year will be up 50 basis points just because of the absence of commercial refrigeration. Noah Kaye : Last quick question. The $200 million of cost synergies for VCS by year three, you could see that reiterated. Where do you expect that to pencil out for this year specifically, is it still $75 million or so? And then should we think about kind of a ratable amount of synergies capture in '25 as well? David Gitlin : Yes, I think it's a good way to think about it. I think this year, we've said $75 million, it may end up being a bit more than that, but it's kind of in that zone. And I think it will be a bit ratable. And look, hats off to the team in the category of controlling the controllables, we've seen very strong savings on the material side, both direct and indirect. The team has been very aggressive at taking cost out. It's never fun. It's never easy. But I would say if there's been anything good in the midst of the sales being down much further than we planned is it's forced us to take a bunch of costs out of the system. So if we can keep that overall cost down as we go into next year, it should drop through at higher margins than we had anticipated. Noah Kaye : Great. Thanks guys. David Gitlin : Thanks, Noah. Patrick Goris : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. Good morning. David Gitlin : Hi, Andrew. Patrick Goris : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just to follow-up on Steve's question on ESSER running over. What we've been hearing is that sort of folks have been able to tap into other sources at the IRA. So that's what's smoothing out the process. Would that be consistent with what you're hearing in the channel? David Gitlin : I think so, Andrew. I think the way we're looking at it, frankly, is that there has been more funding available for this segment, K-12 than ever basically. And the way we see it is that, that's really been driving a lot of the strength that we've seen in that segment for the last couple of years leading into the next couple of years. What we think will happen and the reason we don't see -- the strength we've seen there a discontinuing as we get into the second half of 2026, is that the school budgets themselves have -- but they've been having budgets. They have not been spending, because they've been spending federal money. So I think that there's going to be pent-up capacity of the local school budgets to spend as we get into 2026 and beyond. So we think the strength we've seen will continue because, frankly, there's long overdue requirements in the school system. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just a follow-up question. I know you've sort of provided initial framework for '25. Just a question. As it relates to free cash flow, any onetime items that we should consider within that framework that were maybe related to Viessmann acquisition, how you treat it some of the items on the balance sheet. Anything that we should think about it for '25? Or should we just model normal free cash flow conversion rate within historical range for '25? Patrick Goris : Yes. At this point, Andrew, there is nothing that I would call out. Obviously, we would target to get to 100% of adjusted income taking into account restructuring charges that are cash that we adjust out. So obviously, our target would be to get to that level. Andrew Obin : Thanks very much. And, Sam, congratulations. Samuel Pearlstein : Thanks Andrew. Patrick Goris : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : And the next question comes from Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to ask on orders. Obviously, the -- I guess, nearly 20%, a very strong mark. But you guys said at the Laguna conference that the first few months of the year were tracking up 20% to 30%. So I guess, my question is, did anything soften in September, anything get pushed out? Or is there some impact from the move into discontinued ops? David Gitlin : No. What it really was, Chris, is just frankly was resi that there's been some swings in ordering some of the resi orders. We mentioned resi was up 30% in the quarter. A lot of that was in the first two months. And a lot of our resi orders for the 410A really stopped or slowed as we got into September. So we had said at Laguna Beach that it was up 20% to 30%, we ended up right around 20%. And I think the only delta had to do with resi orders in September. Chris Snyder : Appreciate that. Thank you. And then, Dave, you also talked recently about an aftermarket 2.0 strategy. So maybe can you talk a little bit about how that differs from the existing aftermarket go-to-channel approach? And is there cost associated with the new strategy? And then ultimately, what opportunity does that bring for Carrier? David Gitlin : Yes. I think when we energized with Ajay Agrawal on the team, our 1.0 strategy, going back to like 2019, 2020, it was a lot of the basics. It was really making sure, for example, that we had parts flowing through our system and not going around us. It was having a tiered offering. It was having digital connectivity so that we could start to monitor some of the equipment and track the equipment and having a really cascaded set of metrics around attachment rates and conversion rates and total coverage. I think we're now looking at just the next level of sophistication having to do with rotable pools and looking at where we stack our inventory and using better algorithms to make sure that we have the right parts in the right locations to support our customers when we need -- when our customers need us to avoid the high leakage rates we're seeing in parts. When we look at connecting 50,000 chillers now using that data to create value for our customers and looking not only at maintenance uptime and looking at prognostics and diagnostics, but looking at other value-added things we can create looking at things like carbon tracking, so we can give more value-added services. For Lynx, you're getting in -- for our cold chain looking at things like our supermarket customers knowing exactly what's going to arrive when they need it, so they can have the shelf space ready for it. So we're taking the fundamentals that we've had and building on it. There is some modest investments associated with it, but the beauty of the aftermarket is it's 10% higher margin than the base business. It doesn't require huge investments. What it requires is focus every single day on everyone in the business to go drive the results. It's now into the DNA across the enterprise, including Viessmann Climate Solutions that will drive double-digit aftermarket growth this year, we have a bigger percentage of our portfolio residential. So it drives every single part of the portfolio, not just commercial HVAC to live and breathe it every day, and I see that happening throughout 50,000 people. Chris Snyder : Appreciate that. Thank you. David Gitlin : Thank you. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. David Gitlin : Okay. Well, thank you all for joining. Patrick mentioned thanking the finance team, which is very appropriate. And again, thank you, Sam, to everything you've done for all of us over these past five years. And thanks to the 50,000 teammates that we have within Carrier. We've had a lot going on in the system, this whole performing while transforming. I can't thank our team enough and I thank our customers and our shareholders for their continued confidence. And we're very, very excited to close out the year strong, and then really deliver outsized results as we get into 2025. So thank you all very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Michael Rednor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Michael Rednor : Good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. Except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from operations, excluding restructuring and significant nonrecurring items. A reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave. David Gitlin : Thanks, Mike, and welcome aboard. Let me start by saying thank you to our team for delivering great results in 2024 while completing such a significant portfolio transformation. I am more excited about 2025 than I have ever been entering a new year. I feel as if all of the work done by so many Carrier over so many years has positioned us for this moment to create outsized value for our customers, people and shareholders. As you can see on Slide 2, 2024 was a strong and transformational year for us. We achieved 3% organic growth by delivering double-digit growth in global commercial HVAC and aftermarket, both for the fourth consecutive year to help offset unexpected weakness in residential light commercial HVAC in Europe and China. Total company orders were up low teens with HVAC Americas supplied up about 40%. Our global commercial HVAC backlog is up mid-teens versus last year, positioning us for another year of double-digit growth in 2025 in that business. For overall Carrier, organic growth and strong productivity contributed to close to 100% core earnings conversion, 180 basis points of margin expansion and 16% adjusted EPS growth. We delivered these strong results while we successfully completed our portfolio transformation. We integrated with Viessmann Climate Solutions and executed on our divestitures, yielding over $10 billion in gross proceeds. And as committed, we paid down debt and returned to roughly 2x net leverage. We also returned over $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Turning to Slide 3. I think of our year since spin in 3 phases. During our first phase, we built the foundation for a new Carrier we promoted and added key talent we launched and have lived a new culture embedded in the Carrier way that has given us tremendous energy and a focus on growth and innovation. We launched Carrier excellence to drive operational execution, excellence and productivity. We invested in our product portfolio and developed and implemented our aftermarket playbook to position us for sustained organic growth. We sold Chubb, added Toshiba, simplified the backed office and paid down debt. 2023 and 2024 were fined by our mantra of performing while transforming. We sharpened our vision and successfully transformed our portfolio. We now have greater bandwidth to create even more value for our customers and thus our shareholders. Focus simplification, differentiation, customers, win, grow. The new phase accelerating growth has begun and there is tremendous energy within Carrier. As we navigated this transition, we have been purposefully increasing our addressable market and value proposition for our customers, as you can see on Slide 4. In 2020, we began to not only increase our investments in our product portfolio, we significantly increased our focus on digitally enabled life cycle solutions market has increased our addressable market, contributed to margin expansion all while creating greater customer stickiness and increasing recurring revenues. Now in addition to driving differentiated products in aftermarket, we are introducing fully integrated systems, which further increased customer value across our 3 targeted ecosystems, homes, buildings and the cold chain. For Integrated Systems and homes, we are significantly expanding and enhancing our European home energy management system offerings. And through a newly created business within Carrier called Carrier Energy, we are bringing similar offerings to the United States. For the U.S., we are actively working with utilities to provide an end-to-end integrated battery heat pump solution with automated controls to run the system using stored energy during peak hours while recharging the system during the trough of energy grid usage. The interest from utilities and other customers have been very encouraging to address grid constraints and resiliency. Within Building Systems, one offering is our integrated cooling solution for data centers that we announced last week under the brand of Quantum Leap. By combining traditional cooling, liquid cooling and our building and server management systems, we provide differentiated, more efficient solutions for our customers in this important and growing vertical. For cold chain solutions, we are transitioning from solely selling reefers to providing end-to-end systems enabled by our Linx Digital platform and Sensitech technologies. Selling complete integrated systems provides us with a new and important opportunity for differentiation, customer value and increased revenue streams. Slide 5 lays out our strategic focus areas and priorities for 2025. In addition to our growth initiatives that we just discussed, we also remain laser-focused on margin expansion through carrier excellence while maintaining disciplined capital allocation. We deeply embed our priorities throughout our organization through a structured goal alignment process. Slide 6 shows how these priorities are reflected in our 2025 guidance. Given our strategic positioning, we expect organic growth in single digits with our fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth in aftermarket and global commercial HVAC. We will continue to drive productivity and expect 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. We expect adjusted EPS to be up 17% at the midpoint and about 100% free cash flow conversion. As we look ahead, we will continue to focus on execution within Viessmann Climate Solutions, which we discuss on Slide 7. Obviously, 2024 was well off what we expected coming into the year. Nevertheless, I am proud that the team controlled the controllables and drove share gains, significant cost synergies and key new product introductions. The team also took the tough but necessary actions to significantly reduce both temporary and structural overhead costs, positioning us for strong margin expansion as growth returns. Looking at our growth algorithm for 2025. Given political and economic uncertainty in Europe, we assume that market volume will be flat to down mid-single digits. In addition, we expect a 5-point full year revenue headwind associated with last year's Q1 backlog reduction, which normalized at the beginning of Q2 of last year. On the positive side, we expect continued positive mix with double-digit growth in heat pumps offsetting a modest decline in boilers. Similar to last year, we expect VCS aftermarket to grow double digits, and we also expect a point or so of price. New products introduced last year, including the 19- and 40-kilowatt heat pumps will see a full year of sales in 2025. We are introducing a full lineup of cascadable heat pumps up to 560 kilowatts with natural refrigerants that we will be selling through the Viessmann channel. As we think about revenue synergies, we are excited for the ISH trade show in Frankfurt in March, where we will showcase our new multi-brand products such as our newly launched carrier branded air conditioning units that we will also be selling through the Viessmann channel. We gained share in key European geographies last year and expect that to continue in 2025. We and the team has been putting all the pieces together to significantly increase our complete home energy management system sales this year and beyond. We also remain confident in margin expansion and cost synergies. So all in, we expect a strong year across carrier with accelerated organic growth, margin expansion, EPS growth and strong free cash flow. With that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick? Patrick Goris : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8. In short, Q4 earnings were ahead of our expectations and the guide we provided in October. Reported sales were $5.1 billion, with 6% organic sales growth, including about 2 points of price and 4 points of volume. We had a favorable 13% net impact from acquisitions and divestitures. Organic sales were in line with expectations, driven by continued strength in global commercial and the North America residential HVAC, partially offset by weakness across residential and light commercial HVAC in Europe and China. Q4 adjusted operating profit was up 65% compared to last year, driven by the contribution of Viessmann Climate Solutions, the benefit of organic growth and productivity. As a result, adjusted operating margin expanded by 370 basis points compared to last year. The absence of commercial refrigeration was about 0.5 point tailwind to margin. Adjusted EPS of $0.54 was up 50% year-over-year. Operational performance was in line with our guide, and we benefited from discrete tax items. Net interest expense was a bit light versus our guide given the earlier close of the commercial and residential fire business. Free cash, and I'll now refer to both continuing and disc ops, was an outflow of about $90 million in the quarter. Full year free cash flow of $30 million was about $200 million better than we guided. Having closed residential and commercial fire in early December, we picked up the pace on share repurchases, and we ended 2024 with about $1.9 billion of share repurchases, about $1 billion more than our October guide. Moving on to the segments, starting on Slide 9. The HVAC segment had another strong quarter with organic sales growth of 11%. Organic sales in the Americas were up high teens. Within the Americas, Commercial was up mid-teens and light commercial was a little better than expected and down around 10%. In the fourth quarter of 2023 light commercial was up about 20%, so certainly a tough comp. Residential was up 35%, mostly driven by strong volume compared to a very weak Q4 last year which was about minus 20% as our channel was in destocking mode a year ago. On the last earnings call, we mentioned that we expected no material prebuy in Q4. The actual prebuy was in line with expectations and movement was stronger than expected, movements that is sales from our distributors to installers has continued to be strong in January this year. Organic sales in EMEA were flat, driven by double-digit growth in commercial, offset by a decline in residential and light commercial HVAC reflecting continued market weakness. Organic sales in Asia were slightly positive, driven by strength in Japan and South Asia, partially offset by declines in our residential and light commercial business in China. The HVAC segment adjusted operating margins were up 250 basis points, driven by the benefit of organic growth and strong productivity. As you can see at the bottom of the slide, 2024 was another great year for our HVAC business with continued growth and margin expansion. Transitioning to Refrigeration on Slide 10. Q4 was the first quarter without commercial refrigeration given its exit on October 1. Overall, results for this segment were as expected. Our global truck and trailer business was down around 10% and with North America down about 25% and Europe down low single digits, only partially offset by high single-digit growth in Asia. Container was down low single digits. Our aftermarket and Sensitech businesses were both up mid-single digits. Operating margin expanded by 160 basis points year-over-year. For the full year, this segment was down 1% organically with container up roughly 25% and mostly offset by declines in North America truck and trailer. Margins expanded 20 basis points. Turning to Slide 11. Total company orders total company organic orders were up low teens. Overall, HVAC orders were up about 5% with continued strong orders growth in the Americas at about 10%. EMEA and Asia organic orders were down mid-single digits. In Asia, weak orders in China residential light commercial HVAC were partially offset by China Commercial HVAC orders and strength in other countries. Globally, commercial HVAC orders were up about 10%. Refrigeration orders were up around 55% in the quarter, mostly as a result of very strong growth in North America truck trailer on an easy comp. Truck and trailer orders in Europe were up over 20% and Asia orders were up mid-single digits. Overall, we entered 2025 with robust longer-cycle backlogs in commercial HVAC and orders momentum in key businesses. Moving on to Slide 12 and shifting to 2025 organic sales guidance. We expect mid-single-digit organic growth and reported sales of between $22.5 billion and $23 billion. This also includes a $750 million year-over-year headwind from the commercial refrigeration exit. We expect roughly a 1 point, we expect roughly 1 point of price and the remaining organic growth to come from volume and mix up. We expect currency translation to be at about 1 point of headwind. The organic growth for Board segments is expected to be up mid-single digits for 2025. Within HVAC, we expect the Americas to be up high single digits driven by continued double-digit growth in commercial high single-digit growth in residential, driven by the new refrigerant mix up and low to mid-single-digit growth in light commercial. We expect Europe to be up low single digits with commercial up double digits and flat sales growth in residential and light commercial. Dave just walked you through our assumptions for flat sales growth in this market segment. Finally, within Asia, we expect low single sales growth with China sales flat and mid-single-digit growth outside of China. Within Refrigeration, we expect Global Truck and trailer to be up mid-single digits with North America truck trailer returning to growth in the second half of the year. We expect mid- to high single-digit growth in container and double-digit growth in Sensitech. Moving on to Slide 13, profit and cash guidance. Total company adjusted operating margin is expected to be up about 100 basis points compared to 2024 and with half of the increase driven by volume, price and net productivity, partially offset by investments. The absence of commercial refrigeration contributes 50 basis points of margin expansion. Core earnings conversion that is excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FX is expected to be about 30%. We estimate free cash flow to be about $2.4 billion -- to be between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion, reflecting roughly 100% conversion with normal seasonality. We Finally, we intend to repurchase about $3 billion in shares. Through last week, we repurchased about 900 million of shares so far this year. We estimate that average diluted share count for 2025 will be down about 5% from 2024. Moving to Slide 14. We expect adjusted EPS between $2.95 and $3.05, up 17% at the midpoint. The building blocks are identical to what we shared with you on the last earnings call, except for currency. Adjusted EPS growth includes about $0.30 of operational performance driven by volume leverage, price and net productivity and about $45 million of corporate stranded cost elimination, partially offset by investments. We expect foreign currency translation to represent a headwind of about $0.05. As a result of debt paydown, we expect net interest expense to be a $0.05 to $0.10 tailwind. Finally, we expect a lower share count, partially offset by a 22% tax rate and NCI to provide another $0.10 to $0.15 of EPS benefit. With respect to capital deployment, we'll pay down $1.2 billion worth of debt this quarter. The dividend per share increases by 18%. And as I mentioned earlier, share repurchases are expected to amount to $3 billion this year. As usual, additional guide items are in the appendix on Slide 17. Finally, let me provide some additional color on the first quarter. We anticipate Q1 revenues to be about flat sequentially, a little more than $5 billion, with first quarter organic revenue growth flat, up low single digits. This reflects continued strength in global commercial HVAC and a tough comparison in resulite commercial HVAC in Europe and China. We expect organic growth for refrigeration to be about flat. We expect about 100 basis points of margin expansion in Q1 and adjusted EPS to be between $0.55 and $0.60. So overall, we ended 2024 on a strong note and expect 2025 to be another year of strong financial performance. With that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Patrick. Mike, good to hear you're there, too. Can we just drill a little bit more into resi and what you saw in the quarter. So you're characterizing it, I guess, as no prebuy or no significant prebuy. Maybe you can just kind of elaborate on that. Does that suggest your holding inventory that you sell into the dental in Q1? Or any other kind of color on how the kind of pieces moving parts together? David Gitlin : Yes, Jeff, we'd say that we had a bit of prebuy basically what we thought back in October, we shipped about $75 million to $100 million worth of 410 unit -- 410A units that we would characterize were pull ahead from this year into last year. And we calculate this by looking at the inventory levels that are held by our distributors, which were just slightly elevated versus the same time last year. And as Patrick said, movement was very strong in 4Q. Movement was up about 15% from our distributors to our dealers, and we were up about that same amount in January, first week of February was a little bit lower than that. So look, inventory in the channel, not too high, movement goods. So we think that nearly everything we shipped was underlying true demand with maybe 75 to 100 of prebuy. Patrick Goris : And Jeff [indiscernible] inventory in Q1. So we did help inventory. Yes, we will sell some 4 in Q1 from inventory. Jeffrey Sprague : Right. And then so getting to high single digit for the year, we got in 410A in Q1. And then we've sort of got price-related mix effect for the balance of the year getting us to high single digit. What do you think the kind of realized prices on the 454 units on an all-in basis? David Gitlin : Yes, Jeff, about 10%. But let me walk you through the high single digits. It's really along the lines you were saying. So we think that volume will be flat to down low single digits, which includes that modest prebuy that I just mentioned. Then we expect base price to be up low single digits. So between those 2, you're about flattish the benefit of the mix up of the transition to be high single digits. So 80% of our volume is impacted by the refrigerant transition. 20% is not affected because they are either furnaces or things we ship to Canada. Of that 80%, Jeff, we expect about 90% of that to be 454 and about 10% to be the 410. And of that 454B, we expect a 10% -- to realize a 10% price increase. So that mix up alone, that gets you to about 7% sales growth. And then we expect modest growth in the remaining 20% of the business. Jeffrey Sprague : Grand. Maybe just a quick one, and I'll pass it on. Just on the share repurchase, I think many of us thought you might do an ASR, it looks like you bought a lot the way in Q4. Is that the plan for the balance of 2025 also as the regular way our repo. Patrick Goris : Yes, Jeff. Exactly, as you said, we achieved the same thing without NSR. And not until the balance of the year, we'll expect to be in the market throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Dave, so maybe just a little more color into your outlook for [indiscernible]. I know for a while, you were talking about a stronger potential revenue growth possible in '25 and now you're talking about this 24% backlog reduction headwind. Of course, German elections are coming up. So maybe just talk about the visibility to get to that flat growth. And is it derisked now in your opinion in the guidance when you look at the items that are in your control, aftermarket synergies, how much visibility do you have in getting those pieces of growth? David Gitlin : Yes, I think so. I think that it's a very balance guide, perhaps conservative, but we'll see. I mean, look, we -- when we look at the total market, we just have to be honest that there is a fair amount of economic and political uncertainty in Europe. So we put that volume at flat to down 5%. And we did see -- I think first quarter of last year was the last quarter that I think we shipped out of some level of excess backlog. So that now normalizes in the second quarter of this year, but that will cause us about points of total full year headwind. The stuff that -- so that kind of walked us down to, say, down 5 to 10. But when we look at what's in our control, 3 to 4 points of mix up, that assumes double-digit heat pump growth and down a bit in boilers. And we have pretty good visibility to that. If you look at the second half of last year, just in Germany, or the subsidy applications were up around 65% year-over-year, up 60% on a 2-year stack. Viessmann heat pump orders in the half were up about 40%. So some early indications that there's underlying demand for heat pumps in Germany. So 3 to 4 points of mix up, we'll get a point or 2 of aftermarket with double-digit growth, a point or so of price. And then that bucket of revenue synergies, we're looking at $100 million of revenue synergies this year around the globe, probably 70% in Europe. And I could tell you, Andy, we have that like line by line, the air conditioning units with Carrier brand going through the Viessmann channel. We have Hydronics, we have system-level sales that we're taking from Europe to use for HEMS in the United States. We have multi-brand strategy in China. So details on the revenue synergies. System in could be a new frontier for us this year as we really put the wheels in motion to drive that. Share gains, again, this year, NPI again this year. So we feel good about what's in our control, and we'll keep an eye on the market. Andrew Kaplowitz : And then David, Patrick, it looks like you're forecasting something like low 30s incrementals for HVAC in '25 maybe puts and takes to get there, especially because it's topical around tariffs. How do you account in your bridge? Do you put the China in there? And then there's obviously steel and aluminum, I just got passed, can you remind us of the cost structure on that side of the business? Patrick Goris : Yes. I'll just talk very high level on the tariffs. We have embedded into our guide what's happened with the tariffs related to China and those are fully mitigated in our guide for this year. With respect to what has happened more recently about some of the materials. Most of the materials we purchase such as steel actually come from U.S. vendors. In addition to that, we are pretty well blocked for the full year. In North America, I think we're blocked for about 80 -- close to 80% of our steel volume. So generally, we think we're in a pretty good position there. With respect to your questions on the margins for next year, and I'll talk at the overall company level because given the size of HVAC, it applies to that as well. What you can think about is differently than in '25, we expect a bigger contribution from organic sales growth, that's both volume and, of course, the mix up. That, combined with strong productivity. Those are the main drivers of margin expansion, and that then would be offset by reinvestments in our business. And so it's really driven by organic growth, continued strong productivity the impact of the mix up, of course, offset by reinvestments in our business. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just first off on the organic sales guide for the year. So you're starting out with sort of flat to up slightly in the first quarter. Total company, the year is up mid-single digits. So maybe walk us through kind of how we think about growth for the rest of the year after Q1 and maybe put a finer point on the cadence of a couple of the businesses most in focus, which are Viessmann and the Americas resi HVAC, please? Patrick Goris : Yes. So Julian, from an overall company point of view, I said flat to low single digits in Q1. And that would also, as I mentioned, mean refrigeration flattish and HVAC, therefore, low single digits. Within Q1, VCS because of the tough comp that Dave referred to likely between 10% and 15% down in Q1. And then starting in Q2, we expect sales growth to be in the high single-digit range for the overall company and that include or is particularly the case for the case for HVAC and also for Viessmann. We expect Viessmann in Q2 to be mid-single digits of growth and then the rest of HVAC to be pretty strong as well. And so that takes you Q2 in the high single-digit range that we expect that to continue into Q3 and then the Q4 sales growth to maybe taper down a little bit to the mid-single digits. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. And then maybe if you could focus for a second just on the light commercial business in the Americas. There's often a lot of investor concerns around decline there. And obviously, the orders quarter-to-quarter are lumpy. You're guiding for revenue growth, I think mid-single digits for this year ahead in Americas like commercial. So maybe just help us understand kind of how you see the market dynamics there? Any concerns around the education vertical given ESRA funding moving lower, any color on that vertical would be great. David Gitlin : Yes. Let me just say in terms of the latter piece, specifically with the ESR funding, even though that will start to obviously come to its end, it's going to be replaced with the bond funding from the states, which could be about billion of the bond referendums that have been passed in 30 states or so. So I'll tell you, Julian, we've seen great growth in K-12. Orders for us last year were up 20%. So we feel good about the growth in '25, '26. When we look at light commercial overall, we expect sales growth to be up low to mid-single digits. And kind of like resi, it's driven by the mix up of 454B. We assume a flattish market. Actually, the first quarter will be our toughest compare. So we think that will be down, say, 5% to 10% in light commercial. And then when we think about the full year, the benefit from the mix up is somewhat similar to what we said on resi, but 90% of our volume is impacted by the refrigerant transition. So that 10% excludes sales, for example, the Canada, other sales outside the U.S. Of that 90%, we expect 80% of that to be 454B, and we expect mid- to high single-digit price increase there and then the 20% will be 410A in 2025. So like I said, K-12 looks pretty good. Some of the other verticals are good. Some are in decline that have been in decline like commercial real estate and warehouse. So we feel balanced on the year at that low to mid-single digits. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Just on the resi side, the HRI data is obviously up pretty substantially. You guys are talking like others about a more modest degree of pre-buy. Is there. Do you think you're kind of in line with the industry? Is there somebody else that may be selling more? And maybe just talk about how you see the competitive environment playing out in the first half? David Gitlin : Well, look, we have tools where we look at by distributor exactly how much inventory they're holding. And we're looking at inventory levels, underlying demand driven and looking at movement. And when we do not a tops-down assessment but a true bottoms-up assessment of what we think in the market and what we think the true demand is from our distributors, that's how we got to the $75 million to $100 million. I will say that on a 12-month roll, when we look at last year, we did gain around 100 bps of share, but that's our assessment of what we think the prebuy was. C. Stephen Tusa : And as far as heading into this year, and pricing in the marketplace. Do you see anybody, obviously, there were some big share shifts last year with 1 of your major competitors. What are you seeing in the channel there? And are you concerned at all about any efforts there to regain that share? David Gitlin : Look, that's something that's come up every year for like the last 5 years, we get a variation of that question, which is we've announced pricing. Do we think it will stick because someone else may end up being more aggressive. And every year about what we thought we'd get in price, we've gotten in price. So we think we'll realize about 10% from 454B. Whether or not everyone in the industry is at that level, it's hard for me to say. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Can you guys give us just an update on your capacity additions on Americas Commercial I think I recall you guys pretty significantly increasing your capacity. And then ultimately, what does that ultimately mean for like being able to maybe convert your backlog faster in the next like 12 to 24 months? David Gitlin : Yes. It's a really big deal for us, Joe. I honestly could not be more proud of our operations team because we basically stood up a brand-new facility in North America for commercial HVAC, something that would normally take maybe 18 to 24 months, we did in about 7 to 8 months. So we're ready, we're shipping our first units out of our new North American facility. We're maxing out our Charlotte, North Carolina facility. So with the capacity that we've now built, we have the ability to significantly increase our Charlotte output probably by about 50%. And then we have the ability to get to that same level, if not more, from our new facilities. So we can more than double our output for North America. And the demand has been great. The only thing, frankly, as that's been constraining our demand has been our capacity. And now with the increased capacity, we're starting to bid out of it, assuming that increased capacity, which really positions us for great growth in commercial HVAC out of North America. Joseph Ritchie : Great to hear. And then just my quick follow-up on Viessmann. You guys gave a lot of color around your growth expectations for the year. Can you maybe give us a little bit more on just the margins and the work that you've done from a cost structure standpoint and how we should expect those margins to improve in 2025? David Gitlin : Yes. We ended last year with our EBITDA ROS in the low teens. We think that with the actions that we've taken and will take, that will get to the mid-teens this year. We're looking -- last year, we were looking at about $75 million of cost synergies on a run rate basis. We expect that to be $150 million this year. So Thomas and the team took out, as I mentioned, a lot of temporary and structural costs. And we're continuing to drive cost. And then again, we won't see the kind of top line growth that we know we'll see in future years, but the cost takeout has been significant and will continue to be significant. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Got a lot of ground here. So just a couple of quick cleanups. I think, Patrick, you said 10% of the units this year will be 410A versus 454B. So I'm guessing that the cluster of 410A units held inventory, that's the 10% that happens in 1Q. Just wanted to confirm that. And then the mid-teens movement is something that's getting a lot of attention out there in the market. So just maybe just -- why do you think that's so strong? Maybe just talk about some market share gains, perhaps. So maybe do you think that there's contractors of prebought units and holding them in the inventory or install them? Just wondered if there's any intel on what's happened at the contract level. David Gitlin : Nigel, I was mentioning to Steve that yes, we do think with high confidence that we gained about 100 bps of share last year. And credit goes to the transition we did back in '23 and '25, a very seamless transition with the [indiscernible] change and the team did a great job with the refrigerant change leading into this year. We had the capacity. We had the 410A unit so we were able to produce both sets of units. We have near perfect visibility into the inventory in our distribution channel. We do not have perfect visibility into the inventory in our dealer channel. We have anecdotal visibility. In general, we have -- we can have about 100,000 dealers and many of them typically hold very, very little inventory for a whole bunch of reasons. But can I tell you what certainty exactly how much they're holding? No, but it would be unusual for them to stock too much. So we feel very balanced on the mix that we've laid out for this year versus last year. Patrick Goris : Then Nigel, the answer to your first question is yes, we expect all 410A to be flushed out in Q1 for resi. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's 2 questions to leave it there. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray : I would like to drill down a bit on Quantum LEAP initiative, if we could. Just give us a sense of the contribution from data center for '24. How much did it grow with expectations for 25? And anything you can give us an update on the SLA partnership, how that's going? And it looks like you've broadened some of the product lines within that business as well. David Gitlin : Yes. Let me start with data centers overall, Dean. Last year, it was about $0.5 billion of sales for us for data centers and this year, we think it will double. So we're looking at $1 billion of data center sales this year. So it went from about 10% of our total sales to probably around 15% this year. And remember, the really exciting thing down the road will be the aftermarket sales. So we've done I got to give credit to the team that we stood up our first programmatic team that's focused on a single vertical data centers, Christian and the team under Geron's leadership have 1 -- had great wins with the hyperscalers, and we're applying that same intensity to the colos not only in the United States but globally. So I think we're really in the first inning of some of the key wins that we've had there, and I just see an opportunity for outsized growth in data centers in '25 and beyond. The STL partnership that you mentioned is exciting because we're starting to do more in liquid cooling. STL in our single phase, we have a new investment that we're making in a 2-phase solution, which is a refrigerant-based solution. And then we recently launched -- we announced Quantum Leap, which is very exciting because the whole idea is that we can be a one-stop shop for all the cooling needs that you would have for a data center. So you're looking at traditional cooling, the chillers and the air handlers you're looking at NLI, which you can do server management, you're looking at BMS through our ALC business and then combining the traditional liquid cooling loop with the traditional cooling loop, with liquid cooling that we're now introducing our own CDUs right now. So the idea for hyperscalers and certainly the colos is to say, you worry about running the data centers, let us worry about all the cooling you need by having optimized integrated cooling systems. So we're excited about data centers. We're very excited about the orders growth that we've seen we feel really well positioned for this year. And frankly, that's going to continue to grow as we get into '26 and '27. Deane Dray : Yes. That's all really good to hear, especially because that's what we're hearing from the hyperscale players who want an end-to-end solution on the cooling side. So if you have that with global scale, then you should see those -- that type of growth. And just as a follow-up for Patrick, it's just -- it's a headwind for everyone, but just kind of give us a sense of the setup on FX, the headwind? And just remind us about any type of hedging that you do. Patrick Goris : Yes. So for this year versus the prior year, the sales headwind is about $200 million. And then as I mentioned, it's about $0.05. That's mostly translation. And then on the transaction side, we do hedge the transactions. And so there is some protection, of course, there given all the transactions we go through. And then, of course, given some of the currency streams we have going on in the world, we do also some natural hedging as well that's taking place as well. So I'll leave it at that. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Joseph O'Dea: Could you just talk about the sort of tariff considerations. I think you touched on China and said actions have been taken there. But as it relates to Mexico, just how you're approaching that situation and size it for us? David Gitlin : Yes, Joe, let me start more broadly and just say that we're proud to be the largest U.S. domiciled company in our industry, period. Also, I do want to mention that we have about 10,000 people in the United States, which is up about 20% over the last 5 years on a comparable basis, and we just recently launched an initiative to add 1,000 technicians. So we are invested in the U.S. and will continue to be heavily invested in the United States. I think the tariffs right now in 3 categories. The first is what's been implemented, which is what Patrick talked about. We know about China. We know about the deal in aluminum, and we're confident that we have that mitigated. The second I would put in the category of things other than Mexico that have been discussed like Canada and Europe. And based on what we know on these categories, we feel confident that we can and will mitigate those as well. As you mentioned, the big 1 that we have to keep an eye on is Mexico because we have operations down there. And we purchase a lot from there and do export into the United States. Here's the deal. We do not know -- there's so much we don't know. We don't know if they will go in place. We don't know if there will be exemptions at all. So there's a lot that we don't know. What I can tell you is the team is all over it. We are looking at price actions that we clearly would have to take. We're looking at operational actions that we would take, especially with our suppliers. And we're also looking at that we would contemplate other actions that we would take unrelated to tariffs to make sure that we could mitigate any impact that we can't fully mitigate through pricing and supply chain issues. So what I'll tell you, Joe, is this is not the first time that we've dealt with tariffs. The team is incredibly focused on making sure that we deliver that $3 a share no matter what comes our way. So do we have everything figured out if there's a 25% tariff in Mexico. We don't have it geared out exactly yet. But what I will tell you is that this team will go to tremendous lengths to make sure that we do mitigate it and ensure that we hit the $3 a share. I will also tell you that we are leaning into our factories in the United States. So for example, we're significantly increasing our output out of Charlotte this year. Joseph O'Dea: I appreciate all that color. And then I wanted to ask on the HVAC margin bridge, so the up 50 to 75 bps. Can you just give a little bit more color on puts and takes there. When we think about Viessmann synergy, 454B mix, I presume at a pretty decent incremental productivity. It would seem like there's some building blocks to do better than that 50 to 75. And so just any offsets to that? Patrick Goris : Sure. The way you can think about it is the benefit of productivity, the price, including the mix up. Think of these as being about 150 bps year-over-year. And we're making significant investments as we do each year. And the investments this year actually are going to be more focused on the sales side than just on the R&D side. So it's pretty well balanced this year. And that offsets those tailwinds to get to the margin expansion that I just referred to. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Yes. You sort of highlighted this 1 percentage point of price for 25, if I'm correct. Are there any regions where you do not expect to get price or any verticals where price is flat to negative I appreciate that the mix is in a softer bucket, but just any sort of discrepancy or pricing between regions or vertical. Patrick Goris : I'd say there are probably 2 areas where pricing might be a little less than that. One would be rough generally in that segment, we think it's going to be flattish this year. There will be some differences by region. The other 1 is in Asia, given, of course, what's happening in residential, like commercial in China, the price might be a little lighter there as well. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up on aftermarket progress. I think you guys have provided some KPIs, but can you just give us an update, just a more thorough update on the progress and attachment rates, maybe service as a percent of commercial HVAC business. How is that initiative evolved because before on the debate about resin Viessmann, that was a key focus. It seems like you guys are making very good progress. If you could give us some numbers there. David Gitlin : Sure, Andrew. I will tell you that it still is the key focus. There are all hands on deck on us driving double-digit aftermarket growth forever. Everyone that joins the company or within the company knows that that's our mandate as a team. And all the underlying metrics on our control towers have been positive. We have nearly 50% attachment rate. It was up from 44% in earlier. Our total coverage for chillers. We said it was -- it'd be around 80,000. It's in that range. I think it was just under by 1,000 or 2, so it's in that range. We talked about getting number of connected chillers out there. We continue I think we connected around 45,000 chillers last year. So all of the underlying things, driving a bound in length as our digital platforms, driving attachment rates, driving coverage, driving connectivity, we feel really good about it, and we feel really good about double digits in this year. Andrew Obin : So where are we as a percent of commercialized [indiscernible] revenues to date? David Gitlin : I would say for Carrier, we are in the range of 7%. I think it's just there. And I think we're pushing to get it closer to 30% over these next few years. Patrick Goris : In commercial [indiscernible]. David Gitlin : And then Patrick just added, I guess, it's a little bit higher for Commercial HVAC Yes, as a percent. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley. Christopher Snyder : I wanted to ask about Americas resi, which, I think, a bit stronger 35% this quarter, I think the expectation was 20 to 30. It sounds like the prebuy would moderate, I guess, did that come in maybe a little bit ahead of where you thought 3 months ago? Was just kind of end demand stronger with some of the movement in the channel you're highlighting? David Gitlin : Yes. I think, Chris, it's really a combination of the higher movement than we did that we had expected. We had some share gains and I think just the overall underlying demand was a bit higher than we thought. And just remember, we were coming off such an easy compare from the fourth quarter of 2023, where we were down -- I think our volume was down something like 28%. Our total sales were down around 18%. So we had an easy compare and the underlying demand was a bit more positive than we thought. Christopher Snyder : I appreciate that. And then, Dave, I guess when you either talk to kind of your channel partners or the dealers, is there any concern around the consumer and the homeowner and maybe pushing a little bit more towards repair versus replace or just trading down. Obviously, we're pushing through return change over 10% this year, normal price, low single digits. The whole resi ATEC industry is relying on Mexico. So it seems like there's probably another price increase potentially coming over the next 12 months. Are you hearing any of that? Is that a concern in your conversations? David Gitlin : We -- Chris, we look at that very deeply. We look at our elasticity curves. And the homeowners been through a lot of price increases over these last few years, for sure. So it's something that we watch carefully and certainly, tariffs would not help on the pricing side. So the first thing we look at is, are we seeing a big switch over to repair versus replace. We have not seen that. We ask that of ourselves and our channel partners every month, every quarter. we've been paranoid about it, but we honestly have just not seen that. We will see an occasional mix down at the margin, but nothing overly material. So it's something that we watch. We watch carefully. We I think it's appropriate with price increases and to always look at the consumer, but we feel -- right now, we feel very good. Patrick, you want to add something? Patrick Goris : No. Just a reminder that cost to the homeowner, only about 1/3 of that or less is actually the cost of the equipment. That's ours. Operator : Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Thomas Moll : Dave, I wanted to start on the comment you made about the movement for your resi channel in the quarter, up 15%. We've hit this from a couple of different angles, but I think it will attract a lot of attention today, so worth revisiting here. Are you able to share what the comp was last year? Or any other context that might help explain that comment you made. David Gitlin : I don't think I have [indiscernible] movement in the fourth quarter of '23, unless... Patrick Goris : No. I don't think we have that number handy, Tommy. David Gitlin : I don't have that at my fingertips, Tommy, but the best that we can do is when you think about resi for the full year, it ended up being up high single digits. I think that we were up around 9% last year. And it's basically to the team's credit, the algorithms they've used to anticipate things like inventory and movement orders and the translation into total sales, I could tell you that in my 5 years of Carrier, our algorithms around being able to anticipate thing, it's far from a perfect science in a very short-cycle business, but they're far better now than they were even just a handful of years ago. So we're guiding to the HSD for this year. We think that 1 thing that people would worry about with a big prebuy would be that we would be talking down 12%, which were not. In fact, I think the first quarter should be up double digits. So I think we feel calibrated between the share gains, the inventory levels, the movement, the orders that we've seen and the sales into our channel we've gone out of our way to try to be as judicious and balanced as we can, and we feel good about the guide for this year because basically, that HSD is really driven by mix and price realization. So we think the volume assumptions for the year are fairly balanced. Patrick Goris : And Tom, we had that number. The movement in Q4 of '23 was down low teens and then Q4 2024, up mid-teens. Thomas Moll : Thank you, Patrick. Dave, just to anticipate another line of questions for all of us today. On your ATL commentary for the 10% price. There's been a lot of confusion there just because of things that is what's the base year we're all using and all kinds of noise around this one. But just to give you the opportunity, has anything changed there versus what you expected a quarter a couple quarters ago. And there's also been some questions around 1 of the larger players in the market potentially getting a little more aggressive on price. But really, the core of the question is what, if anything, has changed? David Gitlin : Nothing. I mean from our perspective, I think that Steve asked the variation of that as well, Tommy. Look, I've heard the same things listening to some of our peer calls as well in chatter in the marketplace. But what I can tell you is that every year, we've seen -- we've been paranoid about 1 thing or another, and things that have sort of manifested themselves on the price side the way we anticipate. And the 10% is fairly straightforward. If you take the list price for a 410A unit, we're pricing a 454B unit in that same category is 10% higher. And then we've said 15 to 20 over 2 years, which is on top of the base 10%, 2 to 3 points of base pricing. So we think that we're fairly balanced on a market volume being flat to down a little bit, then a little bit of pricing, a little bit of growth on the furnace side. And then we expect that to stick, and we think that we've tried to even build a little bit of contingency into that 10%. So we feel good about the price sticking exactly what every competitor will do, I don't know, obviously, but we feel good about how we've calibrated our pricing and our pricing with our channel partners. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer Company. Noah Kaye : You gave some good color on the VCS sales walk by line of business. I wonder if it would be possible to get a little bit better view at sort of country level dynamics or at least how you think about the rest of Europe versus Germany in the outlook just kind of given the swing factor and policy for turn specifically? David Gitlin : Yes. Look, Germany, we clearly have a watch on right now. I think that the good news about the pull-up of the election to February '23 is that 1 way or another, we're going to get more certainty. And uncertainty has not been our friend in Germany about policy. So having some level of certainty is good. I think, if I may, at a high level in Europe, say that regardless of what's happening country to country because we will watch France, where France and Poland, where there is some suspension of subsidies, which we expect to resume as we get into the summertime. We know that there's going to be things that happen in Germany that we have to keep a watch on. I will say at a high level, number one, the European Union remains committed to the 2030 goals, 55% renewables by 2030. Remember, in 2027, there's going to be the fossil fuel costs across Europe will start to increase then because we see the expanded scope of the emission trading system, which is introduced for CO2 emissions across all European countries, which is going to trigger I think, a heightened transition from boilers to heat pumps. There is uncertainty in Germany right now. We did see that increase in subsidy applications and orders the second half of last year was a little bit slower, I think, in January. But I do think people were trying to get their subsidy applications in before the election. So we'll see if that translates into positivity as we get into 2Q and 3Q. But I do know that with a potentially new government we'll have to see exactly how things play out. What I will tell you at the highest level, when you hear us at our Investor Day as we get into May, is that we want to get to a point where we are not talking about elections in Germany or France. We are talking about driving solutions for the customer that are independent of regulation and subsidies. So if you start looking at complete PV heat pump battery digital overlay sales in Europe, which are going to be hearing us talk a lot more about, that's driving solutions for the customer, potentially with bank financing that are independent of subsidies or regulations that is good for the consumer, and it's good for the environment and it's good for us. So we'll continue to try to influence and monitor policy from country to country. The EU is going to continue to move in this direction. We've seen gas prices going up more recently. That could continue. I don't think the EU wants to be reliant on importing gas from the United States or from Russia. So that electricity to gas ratios start to come down a little bit. And we're going to continue to push solutions that are independent of policy from country to country. Noah Kaye : I'm glad you mentioned that because you started the call by talking about really this emphasis and the opportunity around the home energy management offerings. It was something you talked about even in sort of the initial deal announcement. But if you could just give us a little bit more color on what you think this means for your wallet share or your expansion opportunity among the different channels that you always have it would be helpful. Not to steal too much thunder from Investor Day. David Gitlin : Yes. I -- look, I think -- at the end of the day, when we look at BCS, we'll be the first to say that obviously, not only were we not pleased that last year was down more than we thought but we dropped it a few times during the course of the year. We've tried to come into this year very calibrated, very conservative. Patrick and I are very deeply tied in with Thomas and Chris Sheppard and the team over in Europe. So we've tried to be very balanced and very bottoms up on our assumptions. When we look at VCS overall, we're very, very happy that we are in residential in Europe, not necessarily last year, but overall, this is a great, great market to be. And the underlying dynamics are exactly what we see in the United States of a highly customized configured, differentiated product offering that is very reliant on a differentiated channel. So we like the market. We like the transition to heat pumps. We like the transition to overall system solutions over time and there's no better company in this space in Europe than Viessmann, hard stop, the most differentiated channel that there is. So when we start putting some of our commercial HVAC products through that channel or a newly branded carrier air conditioning product through that channel, our ability to drive revenue synergies, share gain, new product introductions is unparalleled. So we're excited to have them part of the family, they have made carrier such a better company. And 1 small example is the Head of Engineering for Viessmann Climate Solutions is leading engineering for all of carrier with respect to our centers of excellence, and it's making us a more platform company and a better technologically differentiated company across all of carriers. So we feel balanced for this year. We're going to control the controllables, and we're going to see growth for years to come. So Mike, welcome to Carrier. It's great to have you on board, Patrick. Thank you. And thanks to our 50,000 team members globally. Last year, everyone performed while transforming, and we feel very well positioned for a very strong year in '25, and thank you to our investors as well. Thank you all. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
