At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Rodney Nelson, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Rodney Nelson : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Palantir's third quarter 2020 earnings call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market close and posted on our Investor Relations website. With me on the call today is Shyam Sankar, Chief Operating Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Kevin Kawasaki, Global Head of Business Development. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2020, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects, and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after market close today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures, is included in our press release issued today. Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com.  With that, I'll turn it over to Shyam. Shyam Sankar : Thank you, Rodney, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. At Palantir, we build software platforms for institutions whose work is essential to our way of life. Those institutions must be able to function in times of stability, as well as crisis and uncertainty. And to do so, they need software that works. We were founded in 2003 and started building software originally for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counter terrorism investigations and operations. We later began working with commercial enterprises. We have two principal software platforms : Gotham and Foundry. Gotham, which is our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles, not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Iraq and Afghanistan, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgence and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within data sets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informant, and it helps U.S. and allied military personnel respond to those threats. We later found that the challenges faced by commercial institutions when it came to working with data were fundamentally similar, companies routinely struggle to manage, let alone generate, alpha from data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the way in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data. Our software is on the front line. And sometimes literally, that means so are we. Gotham's use has now extended beyond intelligence analysis into defense operations and mission planning. And Foundry is becoming the central operating system, not only for individual institutions, but entire industries. Turning to the third quarter, revenue grew 52% year-over-year, driven by continued expansion within our install base and initial wins at net new 2020 customers. We are distributing our platforms more efficiently than ever as we generated adjusted gross margins of 81% and contribution margin of 56% in the third quarter. And Palantir has evolved significantly in the last several years, from the development of our second flagship platform Foundry to the acceleration in our government business to the operating leverage from Apollo, our powerful continuous delivery infrastructure, which gives us SaaS operating efficiencies in a very heterogeneous environment. In many ways, our business is just getting started, and this is largely a function of the technology that we've developed over these years. And you can really see that based on what's happening in the field. Let me highlight a few wins. An energy super major was able to leverage our ERP suite an hour and in just a few weeks, generate $57 million of cash savings, a meaningful contribution to working capital for a sector that is challenged in the pandemic. The customer has already identified an incremental $315 million in potential savings on top of that. And this project has created lasting changes in the way procurement will operate with a projected annualized savings of $1 billion. We also closed a 5-year $300 million renewal, mid-pandemic, with a large aerospace customer, further reinforcing Foundry as core infrastructure in the operating system of their business. Aerospace has been significantly challenged in the pandemic, and we see this as a long-term commitment to each other. This is the largest deal we have done in the commercial space, and we anticipate strong contribution margin from a customer of this scale and maturity. Another commercial example I'd like to focus on is a Q3 net new Fortune 100 U.S. consumer goods company. This customer needed immediate help understanding the impact COVID may have on its employees and its operational facilities. This company was dealing with a surge in positive COVID tests across its employee base and was scrambling to monitor the health and safety of its employees, but also the durability of its operation. Over the course of an 8-week pilot, we started in July. Foundry allowed this customer to monitor potential infection, alert individual at facilities where potential outbreaks were occurring and quickly triage to limit the virus' spread. This solution allows the customer to annotate CAD-based models of their facilities with data integrated in our platform to track whether specific areas were particularly conducive to outbreak or that the spread was being driven by internal, external factors. And this enabled the customer to reach out to affected individuals and provide medical assistance. But also, the customer had a long-running project, looking to extract more value out of its supply chain and ERP systems. The firm had invested hundreds of millions of dollars into these solutions, but was struggling to gain the promised economic and competitive advantage from that investment. The customer wanted to use our platform, which they came to appreciate in the context of COVID, to solve core and enduring challenges, specifically to build a real-time buying solution on top of existing investments to make optimized purchasing decisions, such as capitalizing on discounted raw materials when pricing anomalies occur. By leveraging various components and modules in Foundry, the customer is able to model a complete view of its supply chain from upstream raw materials to downstream finished goods in a few weeks. This created hundreds of opportunities across this customer supply chain for optimization. We also signed a recent expansion with a top 5 pharmaceutical company. This firm, like many large pharma companies, is awash in data from thousands of clinical trials. But it's hard to draw conclusions across those trials as data is often siloed in disparate systems of record. Leveraging Foundry, this customer is able to link and interrogate data across more than 2,000 clinical trials, including symptoms, diagnoses and treatments, to unearth valuable findings. Again, across trials, not just in a single isolated study. Our software unlocked the ability to see patient stories at a population level and answer key questions such as how many patients suffer from a particular condition regardless of which trial they participated in? These insights will help the customer both hypotheses around biomarkers and progressions of certain diseases to optimize research and develop new therapy. Turning to our government segment. We continue to pursue our vision of powering U.S. and allied defense to fight current and future threats, from space to mud, and in doing so, becoming the default operating system. We generated several new government wins in the third quarter, including a two-year $91 million contract with the U.S. Army Research Lab. This customer will be employing both Foundry and Gotham to build out artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. Palantir was selected amongst 999 bids, and our platform will be used to integrate, manage, and prepare data for training AI models. Early related work here has shown promising results in delivering next-generation capabilities during a recent warfighter exercise. The Army has leveraged vantage to great effect across various lines of efforts from readiness to financial management. These wins illustrate our expanding partnership with the Army, and we're looking forward to pursuing future programs with both the Army and other branches of the military. In particular, I'd highlight the continued growth of opportunities that we see at U.S. Space Force and U.S. Air Force, which we are investing in. Our work serving health care agencies domestically and abroad continues to deliver results. We were selected by NIH's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, or NCATS, for a $36 million contract to support a secure scientific platform environment. NCATS is using Foundry for integration, management, security and analysis across various initiatives supported by the platform, which include cancer and COVID-19 research. Foundry is powering N3C UNITE, which is the largest COVID-19 clinical data asset in the world with over 1 million patients across more than 30 hospitals, all assembled in Foundry in a few weeks. Foundry is also the infrastructure supporting the complex supply chain and logistics for operational work speed. And this builds on our existing work at CDC, HHS, the NCI and FDA. And it intersects with our commercial work, helping retail pharmacies and drug companies coordinate plans and logistics to successfully deliver vaccines to the population. In the U.K., Foundry has been powering NHS England's response to the pandemic, including the allocation and distribution of more than 2.7 billion items of PPE and other critical equipment. I'd highlight that the President of Colombia recently released a video showing his country's response to the pandemic and the role both Palantir and Amazon Web Services played in rapidly deploying the infrastructure used to manage the situation. This engagement was sourced by Amazon, one of our channel partners. Importantly, we can already see how the pandemic is leading to lasting and systemic transformation of health care in various countries. We have a unique opportunity to power the holistic digital transformation of these organizations with significant improvement in the health and safety of their citizens. It may have started with COVID, but it's not going to end there as the pandemic has revealed a broad swath of challenges and opportunities these institutions are rising to meet. And taken together with our commercial health care work, we believe these developments will have far-reaching positive implications for the future of health care, and we have the opportunity to be at the center of it. Before turning it over to Dave to take us through the numbers, I wanted to touch on our R&D road map. We believe the investments we are making will enable us to drive significant increases in the number of customers that we can acquire and continue to improve our time to value. Our latest R&D investments include enabling our solutions to be fully modular, a take what you want, build on what you have approach for the enterprise. We will be hosting product deep dive for investors in the next month or two. So be on the lookout for an announcement coming soon about these sessions. We're going to showcase how our customers use our platforms across industries and across problem spaces, including defense, health care, supply chain and more. We'll also discuss the latest technical development, our road map and upcoming R&D investments. I'll pass it over to Dave. Dave Glazer : Thanks, Shyam. I'll review our third quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. Third quarter revenue was $289 million, up 52% year-over-year and over $9 million above the high end of the guidance we provided in connection with the direct listing. Average revenue per customer through the first nine months of this year was $5.8 million, up 38% versus the year ago period. Average revenue for top 20 customers grew 36% year-over-year through the first nine months of 2020, totaling $23.6 million. We are seeing greater diversification in our revenue base as our top 20 customers represented 61% of total revenue through the first nine months of 2020 compared with 68% in the year ago period. In the third quarter, we closed 15 deals of $5 million or more in total contract value, including 8 deals in excess of $10 million. Top line growth was driven by strong performance across each of our business segments. Third quarter commercial revenue grew 35% year-over-year to $127 million, driven by a combination of expansion with existing customers and increasing contributions from new customers. We also closed several large deals across our commercial portfolio in the third quarter, including a $300 million renewal in the aerospace industry and multiple wins, each over $5 million in the consumer, insurance, and financial services industries. Especially, in the midst of the pandemic, we continue to prioritize speed of delivery and value creation. While this can lead to lumpiness in our commercial revenue on a quarter-to-quarter basis due to contract timing, we are encouraged by the pipeline we see in our commercial business. Total government revenue rose 68% year-over-year to $163 million, driven primarily by growth in our U.S. government business. As Shyam mentioned, we signed several new government deals in the third quarter, including a two-year contract with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, an IDIQ award with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences and several wins in our international government business as well. At the end of the third quarter, our government deal value, including contracted amounts and contractual options, totaled $1.3 billion. I will next discuss our margins and expenses on an adjusted basis, which excludes stock-based compensation. We generated adjusted gross margin of 81% in the third quarter, up 1,100 basis points year-over-year and reflecting enhanced automation in the delivery and maintenance of our software platforms, as well as reduced cloud hosting expenses. Contribution margin rose to 56% in the third quarter, up roughly 100 basis points sequentially and compared to 15% contribution margin in the year ago quarter, which demonstrates the increased scale and efficiency of our three-phase business model. Now, I'm going to turn to operating expenses. For the third quarter, operating expenses were $235 million. Additionally, in the third quarter, we incurred roughly $54 million in expenses related to our direct listing and $18 million in employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation. Excluding these expenses, total third quarter adjusted operating expenses would have been $164 million. Sales and marketing expense was $71 million or 25% of revenue, down from 54% of revenue in the year ago quarter, all while growing our direct sales force. The operating leverage in sales and marketing is a result of more efficient customer acquisition and more rapid scaling of our customers through our three-phase business model and reductions in travel and office expenses. We expect to continue investing in broadening our customer acquisition efforts including growing our account-based sales force and developing channel partnerships. Research and development expense was $57 million or 20% of revenue, down from 32% in the year ago quarter. As delivery and maintenance of our platforms have become more automated, we are realizing greater efficiencies in developing new features and functionality across each of our core platforms, including the modularization effort Shyam discussed, allowing us to reap savings in areas such as travel and related IT expenses. We do plan to continue to grow headcount and expect R&D expenses to grow in absolute dollars moving forward. G&A expense was $107 million or 37% of revenue, compared with 32% of revenue in the prior year period. This includes $54 million in expenses related to our direct listing. Excluding expenses related to the direct listing and employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, G&A expenses would have been $49 million or 17% of revenue. Third quarter operating loss, excluding stock-based compensation, was $1 million. After excluding expenses related to our direct listing and employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, third quarter adjusted operating income was $73 million, roughly $11 million ahead of the high-end of our prior guidance range. We ended the quarter with total contract liabilities of $622 million. Prior to 2020, we pursued multi-year upfront payments from our customers, leading to significant growth in customer deposits, and often, our cash collections were greater than revenue in any given year. As a result, many customers have already paid for 2020 in prior years, which explains the negative cash flow we have seen through the first nine months. We expect this to begin to normalize over the course of 2021, as we move away from multi-year upfront payments, and we expect free cash flow margin will converge with adjusted operating margin over time. We continue to have strong visibility into future revenues across our customer base, as average contract duration as of September 30 increased to 3.6 years, up from 3.5 years as of June 30. We raised roughly $500 million, primarily stemming from equity investments made by our partner, Sompo Holdings, which closed in June and July. We reduced our total outstanding debt by roughly $100 million in the third quarter. As of September 30, remaining debt is comprised of $200 million term loan under our credit facility, and we also have a $200 million undrawn revolver available to us. We ended the third quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Looking at the business through the lens of our three-phase model, we continue to see strong progress at each stage. As a reminder, we cohort customers at the end of each year into 1 of 3 distinct phases. Acquire phase customers are customers we have engaged in the pilot base, often at little or no cost to them, which have generated less than $100,000 in revenue in that year.  Expand phase customers are those generating greater than $100,000 in revenue in that year, and we invest significantly to scale that customer and grow revenue quickly, resulting in negative contribution margins in the period. Finally, we define Scale phase customers as those generating greater than $100,000 in revenue a year, as well as positive contribution margins, exhibiting self-sufficient usage and growth with our platforms. Acquire phase customers generated $41 million in revenue through the first nine months of the year, while contribution from this cohort of customers is rapidly approaching breakeven with a contribution loss of only $4.2 million, a testament to the speed and efficiency with which we're deploying our software and helping our early-stage customers solve critical problems. This compares to just $19 million in revenue through the first six months of the year, with a contribution loss of $13.9 million. In addition, through the first nine months of 2020, we generated $23 million in revenue from new customers that we have acquired in year, meaning, these are customers that have not yet been classified to one of our three-phase customer cohorts. This compares with $8.3 million through the first nine months of 2019 and represents nearly 200% year-over-year growth. This is a testament to the speed and efficiency of our platforms and go-to-market as we shrink time to value for our customers and accelerate customers from pilot to conversion. Taken together with continued revenue growth from our Acquire phase customers, we believe the rapid growth in revenue from new customers creates a strong basis for future growth to augment the consistent expansion we are generating from our install base of customers in the expand and scale basis. Turning to the Expand phase, we continue to demonstrate strong growth as our customers drive increased adoption of our software to yield greater value. Expand phase customers generated $254 million in revenue in the first nine months of the year, with contribution margin for these customers at 41%. This is up from $161 million and contribution margin of 35% through the first six months of 2020 and a significant advancement from $176.3 million in revenue and negative contribution margin of 43% from the same accounts in full-year 2019. Finally, we continue to see strong contribution margin from our Scale phase customers. These customers generated $452 million in revenue in the first nine months of the year, with a contribution margin of 69% compared with $296 million in revenue and contribution margin of 68% through the first half of 2020. Turning to our outlook. We are raising our full-year 2020 revenue guidance to a range of $1.070 billion to $1.072 billion, up from $1.050 billion to $1.060 billion previously and representing year-over-year growth of 44%. We are also increasing full-year adjusted operating income guidance to a range of $130 million to $136 million, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, as well as direct listing related costs. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in a range of $299 million to $301 million, representing year-over-year growth of 30% to 31%, given our exceptionally strong Q4 2019 revenue. We expect fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $44 million to $50 million, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes. For the full-year 2021, we remain encouraged by the pace of growth we are seeing in our subscription base and the acceleration we are seeing in revenue from Acquire phase and new customers that provide solid foundation for future growth. As a result, we continue to expect full-year 2021 year-over-year revenue growth to be greater than 30%. With that, we'll open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. The government business has shown incredible strength this year. I think many are curious about how you think about the pipeline and the residual kind of carryover from the government business, and maybe if you could also address a big investor concern around the administration change. If that happens, does that have any impact on what you guys see in the government pipeline? Thank you. Shyam Sankar : Thank you, Brent. Yes, the government business had a great quarter. I'd say both segments are performing quite well. We're excited about the pipeline of the government business. Of course, there's the contract that we just closed with the U.S. Army. There's a number of big capture pursuits in the pipeline, things that we've mentioned previously, opportunities like DCGS, Capability Drop 2. There's a lot more behind that, that we expect. There are a couple of more programs of record that we're up for potentially in 2021. And we're investing far beyond just the Army, Space Force, the Navy, Air Force, so very robust pipeline, but that's just DoD. Like honestly, there's been enormous acceleration for a part of a business that was pretty small 18 months ago in health care. The work that we've done with the FDA, CDC, HHS, the NIH has really accelerated. And it's created enormous opportunities for us. And while many of those opportunities certainly accelerated because of COVID, it may have started there, it's very clear it's not going to end there. We're seeing opportunities for large systemic transformation in health care in the U.S. but also abroad, COVID-exposed opportunities for improvement, and I think governments are going to invest there. And in terms of your other question around administration change. Look, for the 17 years that we've been around, we've served every administration in the U.S. We've worked with five administrations in the U.K., four administrations in France and two in Germany. Our users and the folks who buy our software, they've worked with many more because they are actually career civil servants. And so, we don't expect any change really as a result of this. Brent Thill : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from [Mark Randy] with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : This is actually Keith Weiss in for [Mark]. Looking at the metrics on sort of the new customers that were acquired in the first nine months is up 175% year-on-year. Really impressive new customer adds. Can you talk to us a little bit about how much of that comes from sort of the ramping efforts and building out the direct sales force? So is that starting to have a positive impact? And maybe if you could help us, kind of mark-to-market, where are you with that effort in terms of like sales teams or whatnot? And how you expect that to roll out on a going-forward basis? And then maybe just one on operating margins. Really nice sort of uplift in operating margins this year, even though you're building out the direct sales force, can you drill down a little bit more and help us understand kind of where those expense savings come from? And how much of that is going to be kind of \u2013 you guys aren't traveling as much this year because of the COVID environment and we should expect that to come back into the income statement on a go-forward basis? Kevin Kawasaki : Great. Thanks, Keith. So first, the \u2013 what we're doing with the account-based sales force. So we've talked a bit about this. We've been building the team starting with really the beginning of last year. And in hindsight, I think our main mistake was that we should have done more. It's worked very well for us last year and into this year. So, we're increasing this effort. We've talked about tripling our total headcount there today, a fairly small part of the company.  So, we're going to continue to invest here because it's working. And you can see some of the results in some of our general categories or new accounts that we've closed this year, accounts in the Acquire phase, growing revenue and the Expand and Scale phases really performing. But what's really working here, I think, is a little bit more of a technology and a product story. Our speed to value for customers is getting much faster. And there are many reasons, but I'm going to highlight two. First is Foundry modules and software-defined data integration. Shyam talked briefly about a customer mentioned earlier that started using our ERP suite. And they've already saved over $50 million, and they were able to use the software in just a few hours. And this is important to highlight because what used to take weeks of complex data integration and ontology building can now be automated. And this is because of the advancements we've made in software-defined data integration. And that was an example in sort of the large industrial complex, a consumer goods company used that same ERP suite, connected it to our Vertex Foundry module to simulate their supply chain, and it's now helping them run their business more efficiently. So, the same thing here. The software is really driving more of the work. That means time to value is faster and that equals more efficient sales. And by the way, I guess, this recent example was actually sourced by one of our more recent account salespeople. So, big congrats to you and \u2013 that team out there. You guys all know who you are. So, these advancements are big opportunities for sales teams. There are also opportunities for channel partners who seem to be very excited about this. That's the Foundry modules. And we haven't talked a lot about channel partners, but I suspect we will in future periods. And so then I'll hand it back to Dave for the conversation about the operating margin. Dave Glazer : Thanks, Kevin. So I'll sort of just revisit our long-term targets for margins, retargeting adjusted gross margin of [35%] plus contribution margin by 70% plus and adjusted operating margin of 35% plus. In terms of adjusted operating margin \u2013 adjusted operating income, we raised our 2020 full year guidance to $133 million at the mid-point. And when you're looking at sort of our adjusted operating income, you can see that COVID accelerated a lot of change across the company. And this is \u2013 it really resulted us in leveraging a lot of our previous R&D investments in things like Apollo. And so while there was a lot of change that happened with COVID, and you're going to see a lot of that sticking, but with that said, we're going to continue to invest. As Kevin talked about, we're going to continue to invest in our direct sales force, continue to build out products, sort of like Apollo, continue to get that operating leverage. And we'll continue to see top line growth continue to outpace expense growth. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with RBC. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a great first quarter. You mentioned a little bit about modularizing the platform componentry and something that you're going to talk about in here in the short \u2013 in the near term, can you talk about what kind of motion is that going to unlock? Why you're doing that now? What do you \u2013 and where do you expect that to have a bigger impact on commercial or federal sales? And then just a financial question. If we think \u2013 remind us a little bit about the seasonality of the business. And as we look to next year around top line growth specifically, how should we think about revenue linearity, specifically maybe 4Q to 1Q and then beyond? Shyam Sankar : Great. Thanks, Alex. So, just to back up a little bit, thinking about Foundry here, we've built this \u2013 over the last five years we've built this end-to-end platform. And we've been investing significantly in the R&D to do that. And so \u2013 and that really paid off. In the first three weeks of COVID, we started 83 new engagements. And we could do that because we had a solution that customers could start using in a matter of a few hours that can solve scaled problems in an end-to-end sort of way. And that has a premium in a crisis, and crisis have always been a tailwind for our business, whether it's the global financial crisis or ISIS attacks in Europe in 2015 and 2016 or the present-day pandemic. But we also recognize that many customers have made investments in IT capabilities that they are more or less happy with. And so by modularizing the offering, we're able to let them take what they need from the offering, but then build on what they already have. And that allows us to have a kind of a more nuanced land and expand motion over time. It changes the offering in a way that you can -- you have more flexibility on the price point and how you \u2013 it gives you a new way of going to market with channel partners. So, we think it actually opens up a lot of opportunities. Customers are pretty excited about that. We've seen opportunities to leverage those modules already with new customer and the new \u2013 at both \u2013 and on the pipeline side, but even new customers where we're actually implementing and converting. And yes, I think that it's \u2013 and I also \u2013 I guess, the last part of your question, I would expect to see this both in government and commercial. Kevin Kawasaki : And I'll touch base a little bit on the guidance for 2021. So, 93% of our customers \u2013 or 93% of our revenue is from existing customers, recurring and growing. So, we're very focused on bringing on new accounts because that creates a starting point for this land and expand dynamic, but again, 93% coming from existing customers, recurring and growing. A little bit more \u2013 a few more numbers there, I think, are important to focus on.  Average revenue per customer through the first nine months of this year grew 38%, compared to last year. Average revenue for our top 20 customers grew 36%, compared to last year. And for both these numbers, still three months to go here. We've also reduced our customer concentration. Our top 20 customers are going from 68% of our total revenue to 61% of the total revenue through the first nine months of 2020. Touching just briefly on the seasonality question, I think it's important. One thing you might be pointing out and focused on is that we had a very strong fourth quarter in 2019. It was about 20% sequential growth. So what you're seeing a little bit here in 2020 is that smoothing out a little bit. And so \u2013 and what you've also seen is our guidance raising a little bit to 44% for the full year. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Chris Merwin : Okay, thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the commercial business. It looks like it grew 35% in the quarter, which I think was well above the growth rate you had for last year. I know you had a very significant $300 million renewal in the quarter. Was that the main driver of the acceleration? Or was it the other wins that you called out as well? And how should we be thinking about the sustainability of that higher growth rate for the commercial business in the near term here? Thanks. Kevin Kawasaki : Yes. It's been a great couple of quarters on the commercial side here. I think the drivers are really a diversified set of new deals that if you we look at the renewal here, that's really looking at 2021 revenue and beyond. So, we should look at that towards future periods. And so the work we've done with the U.S. consumer goods company, the work that we've done with other manufacturing companies, U.S. and abroad, the work that we've done in Japan, all of these things are building into the commercial business. And we expect to continue to close deals in this area.  One thing we are leaning into significantly, as the second wave of the pandemic seems to be upon us here, is helping our customers and so we're very aggressive about getting started, working immediately. We can deploy our solution within hours and can have a meaningful impact on the durability of their operation within hours to days. And so we're leaning in very hard to doing that and figuring out the specifics around payment and timing and all that stuff later. It's a great opportunity for Foundry to really be the core operating system that delivers in a big moment. It's what we spent the last five years investing our R&D in, and the software is there to meet that moment. Chris Merwin : Great. And maybe just a follow-up on the commercial as well. I think you touched on it briefly before, but I wanted to ask about how the sales motion is evolving. I know there's a lot of use cases for commercial, a growing number of use cases for commercial, but in terms of making these customers aware of the power of the platform, is that really going to be a direct sales effort? Or could we see some more investments in growing the partner ecosystem just given, I'm sure, the complexity that the issues that a lot of the commercial customers are facing? Thanks. Kevin Kawasaki : Sure. So the direct sales force is \u2013 we're continuing to invest in doing quite well there. I think it's a little early here, but we're sort of feeling somewhat optimistic about the early work with some of the channel partners. We've seen some early success. I think we'll be talking more about that going forward. And I think particularly in the commercial market, it's certainly true that the more we do, and oftentimes just the faster we do it, it opens up a lot more opportunities for us. And it's something that you'll hear more about with Foundry modules, is that the customer is really able to have sort of much more opinion, not only on how they use Foundry, but what specific pieces of Foundry they would like to use. So, instead of being required to use the full Foundry stack, the customer can now choose only the part they need, so they can build on what else it is that they have. And that gives us a lot of flexibility. It gives us flexibility on pricing, but also, it does open this big, Shyam, mentioned sort of window for channel partners who seem to be quite excited about that. So, look to hear more about Foundry modules. We plan to show as much of this as we're able to in the upcoming presentations. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks so much and congrats to you all on a nice strong quarter out of the gate. My one question is actually pretty simple. I just wanted to ask about contract duration, which I think you disclosed at 3.6 years this quarter. Maybe you can comment on how that's trended year-on-year and how you expect that might trend forward into calendar 2021. Kevin Kawasaki : So, we're pretty happy with sort of getting additional visibility on the revenue here. I think when we're thinking about 2021 then we're really sort of looking at the portion and success we're having with the breakdown of the three-phase model. And when we looked at just new customers that we've acquired in a year, that group has grown nearly 200%, Dave mentioned this compared to last year. The Acquire phase has grown over 100% just the last three months. And the interesting thing about the Acquire phase is that there are a lot more accounts in here that are not yet customers. In other words, there are many accounts that are in Pilot phase that we believe will grow over time into the Expand and Scale phases, and you're seeing some of this in the growth of the Acquire and the new account phases. So, these are kind of the early land portion going into our model here. The Expand phase accounts, we did $254 million through the first nine months of the year, and those accounts did a 41% contribution margin. So, for some context, this same group did $176 million and a negative contribution margin of negative 43% in 2019. So that's 44% growth already for this year, and we still have three months to go. And again, worth kind of focusing on here, this account group went from negative 43% contribution margin to positive 41%, while growing revenue at this rate. And then the last portion, I think, should focus on is the Scale phase customers. Scale phase accounts generated $452 million of revenue through the first nine months of the year, contribution margin of just below 70%. At the limit, we think all accounts should be in the Scale phase, and that Scale phase should grow. And we're seeing this in the performance of the contribution margin in both the Expand and Acquire phases. So, it looks like we will see growth in the scale category. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke : Hey, thanks so much for taking my question. Shyam, I wanted to ask a couple of questions to you, and I thought it was pretty interesting, one of your comments on just saying that you wish you'd invested faster or sooner in the direct sales force. And I guess, I'm curious now that you've kind of been able to look at the successful investments, just how are you thinking about growing overall headcount from here. I think the original target was for somewhat muted headcount growth in 2020, I think, maybe 4% to 5%, but given some of the successes and some of the things you're investing in with the Foundry modules, how are you thinking about growing headcount going forward? And then just had a quick follow-up on the Foundry modules, how do you think that kind of changes the competitive environment for you guys? Do you think you're going to be kind of going up against some of these data and analytics point tools and kind of the best-of-breed vendors there? Maybe just give us a sense for how that changes your competitive landscape as well. Thank you. Shyam Sankar : Yes. On the first question \u2013 thanks, Tyler. So, on the first question, I think we were \u2013 what we're very confident is that top line will continue to grow much faster than operating expenses. You're right, if we find opportunities to invest, we're going to take them. But right now, I'd reiterate what we're kind of expecting around 4% or so headcount growth. One of the things that's in there that kind of might make that 4% seem low, but it's actually \u2013 we're getting so much more efficient, right? What we've been able to do with our sales and marketing spend, and even though we're hiring into our direct sales force here, in some sense, it looks like sales and marketing is going down, which isn't actually what's happening. We're actually doing more sales and marketing, but we're just much more efficient at delivering it based on the investments we made around Apollo and software-defined data integration. And so, I think we're getting just a big benefit from there. We're able to do a lot more with the same humans that we do have. And so, we're seeing some of that benefit. And in terms of Foundry modules in a competitive landscape, we think there are a couple of things that we're doing on the modules, at least that we keep hearing from customers that are really unique. I think customers will continue to pick those. The important part here is working with the customer to find what investments they really believe in that they've already made, ensuring that the architecture that we're putting forth fits with their plans, their road map going forward. And so I think of it much less as a competitive situation in terms of what the customer is evaluating this best-of-breed tool versus that tool.  It's really about, look, I have things I'm happy with. I really believe in your solution, but I want to be able to leverage the investments I've already made. And that's going to help us win a lot more. It's going to help the direct sales force to be more effective. It means that channel partners have a proposition that they can succeed with, both because it will integrate with their existing offerings. But because also the channel has to do less to really get this to work for the customer in terms of their enterprise architecture planning. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to the Palantir management for closing remarks. Shyam Sankar : Well, thank you all so much for joining us for our first quarterly conference call. We hope to have many more with this group here. I would like to end by just thanking all of our employees, past and present. It's the commitment to do the hard thing that we see from them all the time, and it's so inspiring. They built this company over years and years of hard work. And when the crisis came, when the pandemic came, they were ready. They met their moment. So thank you guys so much. Thank you all. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. [Technical Difficulty] Alex Karp : Welcome, Palantir had a very strong year, last year and then because of the strength year, it might be worth taking a second and asking, well, what do the numbers actually mean? Obviously, on the face of them they\u2019re strong and even curiously strong. We believe, I believe that Palantir\u2019s numbers are a lagging indicator of several macro trends that we got right. First is the obvious macro trend that is almost become venality that the world is becoming a software world and the institutions that survive and thrive and provide benefits to their citizens, both in terms of actual output, but also real output, meaning output that includes data protection that make sure that the data is actually preserved in a way that guarantees its veracity that gives comfort to its citizens that make sure the citizens aren\u2019t merely a product to be monetized. And second that as diverse as the institutions are that we work in from clandestine services to providing AI in the most sensitive military context to working with oil and gas companies to airlines to pharmaceutical research took all aspects of helping to ameliorate the plague that is COVID. There\u2019s one trend; institutions, countries, individuals that can assess the value of software that can work now are the institutions that survive and provide value both in the government, commercial and even moral context, moral as defined by they increase the legitimacy of institutions. One of the primary issues we have in the West is the dearth of legitimacy of commercial and government institutions of experts. And this makes it very impossible to navigate issues around how do you rebuild your company internally and externally to conform and thrive in a very difficult context, where there\u2019s COVID rebuilding the supply chain, political volatility, uncertainty in general skepticism about anything you say. That is a software problem. How do you actually look at the data? Understand that the data is actually true. Understand the veracity of the model? How do you understand \u2013 how can you prove to people that their data is not being be abused, monetized, used to discriminate against them? Were the people listening to you have a great deal of skepticism? How do people, who are on this call presumably, trying to evaluate the actual value and meaning of our numbers? It\u2019s very hard for them to do \u2013 to understand this without understanding what is the actual background of the numbers? Are they afford indicator or a lagging indicator of a macro trend that you either got it right or wrong? One of the interesting things about philosophy, history and software is that when something becomes crucial to a society, absolutely determinative, it sets off a dialectic of learning. So that the \u2013 what we understand about what it means to procure software, use software, integrate into a world that is defined by software, is very different than what we would have thought about it when it was a luxury product. And that\u2019s largely how software has been viewed here before. It\u2019s something that can augment your enterprise, your government; it can make your enterprise slightly better than your competitor in a myriad of context. It can make you a military slightly more efficacious, slightly more transparent, or in some contexts, less transparent. It can make things more cost-effective, but that\u2019s not the context we\u2019re in now. We\u2019re in a context where it is basically binary, institutions and societies, which implement software effectively, will dramatically outperform. In every context, in the military context, in the clandestine context, in the COVID context, in the context of every commercial entity that we\u2019re involved in, everyone I\u2019ve ever seen and everyone you\u2019ve seen. And then the real questions like, well, what does it mean to survive in a COVID like context or how do you stop the next pandemic? In a Western constellation, where civil liberties data protection is crucial, you can\u2019t just, re-orchestrate the society and re-orchestrate the data without having buy-in from the people that nominally, or hopefully completely control the society. Those are software problems. And then the people who are in charge have to \u2013 are going to learn and will learn over time. What does it mean when someone says that software works? What does it mean for software to be implemented effectively? What is the actual alpha, is the alpha adjust the output, or is it the output also measured against the moral context, the moral imperatives that allow us to unify in a society? There\u2019s a very famous quote from Wittgenstein [Foreign Language] which means roughly paraphrase to believe you\u2019re following the rule isn\u2019t to fall a rule. This is typically used to explain important trend in language philosophy. But you could also look at this as like to use software, it doesn\u2019t mean to actually use software. If software is absolutely determinative of the current condition, just like language was, it\u2019s like in a philosophical sense, you could say we\u2019ve had a shift from the language imperative or language is actually what determines meaning; two, a software context where it\u2019s actually software is determining meaning value and legitimacy. Why do commercial and government institutions struggle with legitimacy? Because in many cases, it\u2019s very hard to understand what is the output? How did it happen under what context? What was paid for it? What did we get? And then the structures we\u2019ve built are treating software as a cosmetic, augmentative attribute when in fact software is the language of our time and a mastery of software will determine what works and what doesn\u2019t. The numbers that you\u2019ve seen our reflection of our bet that this would happen, they are a lagging indicator. And we believe that the transformation, which is happening in the world now, will accelerate. And that the way in which we\u2019re providing software, both a Foundry/Gotham, and our ability to scale this through Apollo will be the way that everyone at some point will actually try to build software. And the way in which institutions will procure software, because of a dialectic of macro and micro conditioned, a dialectic, which will force change, because the winners will figure this out. [Technical Difficulty] Rodney Nelson : On today\u2019s call, you\u2019ll hear from Alex Karp, Founder, and Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Operating Officer\u2019; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer, and Kevin Kawasaki, Global Head of Business Development. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Shyam. Shyam Sankar : Thank you, Rodney. First, I\u2019d like to congratulate the NHS and the UK for a stunningly successful vaccine rollout. The NHS is truly a national treasure. I\u2019d also like to congratulate HHS protect on winning Gartner\u2019s Eye on Innovation Awards for Government in 2020. And finally, I\u2019d like to congratulate U.S. Space Force\u2019s Kobayashi Maru, their cutting edge software factory for winning the Software Innovation Team and Gears of Government Awards. To 2020 results. 2020 was a seminal year for Palantir. We helped 100 commercial organizations and 10 national governments respond to the COVID crisis. We were able to solve incredibly complex problems in three days and enabled our customers to reinvent themselves amidst these continuums shocks. But of course, that\u2019s not just three days. It\u2019s 15 years of product development, more than $2 billion on R&D and three days. And for many of those customers, in a short period, we became their default operating system \u2013 we became critical to the core functioning of their operations. In meeting that moment our business grew significantly in 2020 resulting in 47% revenue growth on a full year. And we created and continued to create substantial opportunities for growth over the next year and beyond. Last week, we announced a groundbreaking partnership with IBM, where IBM or OEM, a number of foundry modules and its Cloud Pak for data offering enabling commercial customers to easily build AI-infused applications, leveraging a trusted data foundation and enterprise AI. This partnership dramatically expands our distribution capabilities, leveraging IBM\u2019s data and AI\u2019s 2,500 sellers. For context, that is a sales force that is larger than all of Palantir. Along with an already large installed base of Cloud Pak customers. We were very excited about what this partnership means for our go-to-market in 2021 and beyond. The response, since the announcement from prospective customers has been incredibly strong. There\u2019s a lot of momentum, a lot of energy. And we will continue you to pursue channel partnerships to enhance our distribution. The product driven momentum is clear and building across both segments of our business. We invested in technologies that would help our customers get value fast and create enduring operational value that compounds. Continuously delivered upgrades to our software become upgrades to our customer\u2019s businesses. Our Foundry 21 Launch represents the culmination of that work, but software defined data integration we\u2019re automating away the complexity of integrating systems with a drag and drop interface frontline business users can build production grade AI-infused applications. Modularity allows customers to take what they need and build on what they have. Archetypes bring point and click use cases to accelerate outcomes, all part of how upgrading our software upgrades their business. As we move into 2021, these innovations are not only helping our customers generate value much faster. They\u2019re also allowing us to broaden our go-to-market. We expect to add triple digit head count to our sales function this year. In our commercial segment, we generated greater than a 100% U.S. revenue growth in 2020 on the back of investments and our direct sales force. And in the fourth quarter, we signed several large deals with customers across a variety of sectors, including automotive, energy, healthcare, insurance, mining, and shipping. We signed a multi-year enterprise agreement with Rio Tinto in the fourth quarter. This partnership is the culmination of several Foundry deployments integrating data from across Rio Tinto\u2019s operations, spanning 90 plus systems, including machines, sensors, and instruments. These initiatives helped Rio Tinto transform bore rates into a digital business across the value chain to increase production and enhance profitability and connect people in Rio Tinto\u2019s underground operations with data. Foundry will be both a single source of truth, combining operational and transactional data and a digital twin that will enable Rio Tinto\u2019s employees to make data-driven decisions and take action from headquarters to the mind face. We signed a multi-year contract with Pacific Gas and Electric to help it streamline operations across the company. PG&E collects 10 billion data points every day, spanning both structured and unstructured data, which feeds the digital twin of PG&E\u2019s network within Foundry to enable root cause analysis and upgrade monitoring. We expect this will allow them to improve their electric operations and asset management resulting in enhanced safety and grid reliability. PG&E will have a single integrated platform providing a complete operating picture to make fast effective data-driven decisions and its public safety power shutoff program, which will help mitigate future wild fire risks. And this is just the beginning of our joint enterprise vision. In addition, we signed a significant expansion with the Fortune 50 healthcare company in the fourth quarter. Across the healthcare industry, there are increasing market pressures ranging from reimbursements that are becoming tied to value-based care, increasing costs of pharmaceuticals, as well as an expanding number of competitors. Managing unit profitability at a granular level becomes much more important in this environment. And this customer was facing the inability to model their complex contract and pricing models in order to make actionable decisions for the negotiations and payments management. This issue is wildly complex, as it involves managing the balance between revenue and cost of goods sold models that are managing the network of suppliers, supply chain, labor, payers, and regulatory coefficients. By integrating these disparate sources into Foundry, the customer now has a contract management solution that automates away this complexity, allowing the company to focus on operational decision-making and outcomes. And this has already led to $50 million of annual as value. We continue to deepen our partnership with BP. And in the fourth quarter, we signed a five-year, nine figure enterprise renewal. We have worked with BP since 2014. Our software is the backbone of BP\u2019s digital twin applications, which has generated over a $1 billion of value in 2020. As part of our ongoing partnership, our software will help BP continue its transformation as they work towards their net zero ambition. These applications will accelerate BP\u2019s initiatives in wind power, electric charging network, solar power generation, and other initiatives to deliver energy more safely and efficiently for years to come. We\u2019re also deepening our work with the Fortune 200 industrials manufacturing customer, and our relationship rapidly evolved over the course of 2020 to incorporate several use cases within Foundry. As a manufacturer of personal protective equipment this customer faced substantial supply and demand shocks into the onset of COVID, accentuating the need to re-imagine the firm\u2019s supply chain management and order processing practices. After integrating its baseline supply chain performance models and order fulfillment records, the customer was able to move away from its first-in first-out order fulfillment and deliver PPE to those, who were most in dire need all in under a couple of weeks. The customer is using our software to address enduring challenges, including modeling, supply chain scenarios, and conducting forecasting and demand sensing to alert users to future bottlenecks and inventory risks. The net result is a decision-making engine at the intersection of a connected supply chain with connected manufacturing. Turning to our government segment. Our Gotham 21 Launch underscores both our ongoing vision to provide the central operating platform for government, as well as our focus on the near-peer fight in the defense context. We made extraordinary progress on these initiatives in 2020 overall. The full-year government revenue rose 77%, led by ongoing momentum in the U.S. which grew 91%. As tremendous of a year as 2020 was for the government segment we believe we were just at the tip of the iceberg and we are well positioned to capture significant new opportunities in 2021 and beyond. Our intensive product investments in developing an end-to-end sensor-to-shooter and space to mud capability are paying off. We were creating unique opportunities to enable the warfighter with AI superiority and that technology is starting to create large program of record opportunities across the services. Our partnership with the U.S. army continues to expand. Vantage is a critical asset for the army to support both readiness and financial management. Vantage helps the army free up $3.3 billion for reinvestment. In December, the army exercised its first option year. And we are excited to continue this work with army vantage. We recently won a pair of new contracts with the army to accelerate its modernization efforts. In November, Palantir was selected to provide a prototype for the Army\u2019s common data fabric and data security solution to support capabilities at 2023. This is yet another opportunity for our software to be used in the mission command space, operating at the intersection of intelligence, mission planning, and execution. It is a true honor to have the opportunity to aid the army in its efforts to provide an integrated solution that will ultimately improve access to critical data for commanders and soldiers deliver efficient use of networks and denied and degraded environments, in increase the collaboration with joint and allied partners. In January, we were down selected to deliver a prototype as part of army\u2019s ground station modernization in support of the Titan program. Under the $8.5 million Phase 1 contract Palantir will collaborate with the army to demonstrate a solution that integrates space high out, aerial and terrestrial sensors for using intelligence command and control. The overall solution, which carries a total potential contract value of a $0.25 billion across all phases we\u2019ll provide operators down range with shortened targeting timelines by incorporating data integration, sensor fusion, and advanced analytic capabilities using AI. We were built for this. those years of product investments, I was just mentioning, that\u2019s this. We are looking forward to continuing our work in this area with the army, as well as pursuing similar programs with other services. And while a lot of new 2020 U.S. defense opportunities started as crisis response to COVID, almost all of it is relevant to enduring problems and needs. For example, we started working with the Air Force in may of 2020 to support their COVID response. The engagement has supported COVID-19 testing, PPE availability, helping plan vaccine distribution, and personnel availability. but it\u2019s also clear to the Air Force, how it can see all the fleet availability, combat readiness and equipment readiness. In the UK, Palantir\u2019s software is powering three of the country\u2019s most important national priorities, PPE, vaccines, and managing trade post-Brexit. In December, we signed a two-year contract with the NHS, worth up to $31 million, where a Foundry will serve as the core platform for secure, reliable, and timely data processing to enable decision-makers to efficiently plan and distribute resources, improve patient care and protect patient privacy. Additionally, the highly successful UK\u2019s vaccines program ordered, allocated, tracked and delivered their vaccines in Foundry. While we continue to partner with the world\u2019s leading healthcare institutions to come back COVID-19, we closed deals that are focused on supporting their ongoing transformation in a post-COVID world. In the fourth quarter, we expanded our relationship with the FDA with a three-year $44 million contract. Our partnership with the FDA began in 2017 to aid the oncology center of excellence in regulatory research across clinical trial data. Our relationship evolved over time to include the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, CDER, which we assisted in the fight against the opioid crisis and supported regulatory review activities. This new agreement will continue our work with the FDA in mission critical enduring workflows, such as ensuring manufacturers are complying with agency rules and regulations and enhancing drug reviews. This speed up time to market while maintaining the highest safety standards and there is significant opportunity for further expansion as our work today touches on just two of 16 centers and offices at the FDA. we closed out the year with strong momentum. In the fourth quarter, we signed many significant deals, 21 deals worth $5 million or more including 12 deals, each worth $10 million or more. in aggregate, we generated 47% annual revenue growth. We saw customer concentration and revenue concentration decrease even as the number of significant deals grew. our pipeline is substantial and growing. These deals, they start in the acquired phase of our three-phase model and with new customers, who are acquired in year that have yet to even join a phase, both of these groups performed exceptionally, a very positive forward-looking indicator. Additionally, the intensive growth of existing customers continued with average revenue per customer growing 41% to $7.9 million. We grew the number of accounts with $10 million of annual revenue or more by 50%. We\u2019re continuing to demonstrate our ability to grow customer relationships at scale, as we add ever increasing value to our customers\u2019 enterprises. And it\u2019s still very clear that we\u2019re just at the beginning. Our customers include only eight of the Fortune 100, 12 of the global 100 and only 24 of the global 300. The opportunity in front of us is immense and growing. And finally, I\u2019d like to thank each and every habit for their exceptional efforts in 2020. You went where you were needed most from the front lines of the vaccine to the factory floors at PPE manufacturers from the briefing rooms of prime ministers to the war rooms, where the nitty-gritty work actually got done. You built the products that met their moment, and you did all of this while driving the operational changes and support functions that executed the business. You supported each other through the ongoing trials and tribulations of the pandemic. You are all a constant reminder that not all who wander are lost. I am proud of what you accomplished. And I\u2019m so very honored to call you coworkers. And I\u2019m very grateful and often in disbelief for the joint opportunities that we have for impact. This truly is only the beginning. Thank you. to kick off the discussion on financial results, I\u2019ll now pass it off to Karp. Alex Karp : There are many insights; indeed, some secrets that have powered Palantir and got us from a company that in the beginning no one believe would succeed, because we\u2019re heavily focused on strengthening the west through a near fanatical fixation on data integration and data protection. When we transferred to the commercial world, people didn\u2019t believe that would succeed, because there\u2019s no history of anybody going from government to commercial. When we went, we became a global company, people didn\u2019t believe that would succeed, because the global \u2013 typically companies that started with in the American government or in America do not succeed or thrive abroad. When we went and did our DPO people thought we should IPO, because that is the best and quickest way to transfer money to Wall Street. But we believe we should be focused on allowing the average person to participate and therefore absorb that risk. And now, as we\u2019ve had a pretty sublime year based on any conventional metric, and as you\u2019ve seen the results, we want to underscore this relentless focus, what you could call an insight secret, it would \u2013 should be a venality of business, have a long-term focus on the health of what we believe is, and will be continued to be one of and will become the most important software business in the world. And to do that, we\u2019re providing long-term guidance pretty radical in the sense that we are committing to keeping a growth threshold of above 30% for the next five years, but not focused on the day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter near-term focus that quite frankly destroys businesses is one of the main reasons why so many of our businesses, especially in tech are actually only serving Wall Street and not serving their clients and not serving an everyday investor and generate suboptimal returns over time, because they too are lacking indicator of the suboptimal performance. near-term, my optimism [ph] of running a business, and at Palantir, obviously, we have rejected this in every way, both from the way we\u2019ve produced software, from the way we interact with clients from the best we\u2019ve made, that tend to be vets that come to our vision years after a very, very significant investment, any case, we hope those of you on this call, who are a current investors stay with us. And those of you who prefer a more short-term focus that you choose companies that are more appropriate for you. Dave Glazer : Thanks, Karp. I\u2019ll review our fourth quarter and full year 2020 performance followed by our outlook. Full year 2020 revenue was $1.93 billion, up 47% year-over-year. Fourth-quarter revenue was $322 million, up 40% year-over-year, and roughly $21 million above the high end of our prior guidance range. In addition, for the full year 2020, the average revenue per customer was $7.9 million, up 41% year-over-year. Average revenue from the top 20 customers was $33 million, up 34% year-over-year with our top 20 customers representing roughly 61% of our total 2020 revenue, down from roughly 67% in 2019 as we continue to broaden our revenue and customer base. For the full year 2020, 43% of our revenue was generated from new customers in 2018 or later exemplifying our improving ability to rapidly onboard customers to our software and realized compounding value as their data assets grow and used cases develop. We see this scaling taking place across our customer base. In 2020, the number of customers generating more than $1 million in revenue annually grew 32% year-over-year. Customers generating more than $5 million annually grew 54% year-over-year. And customers generating more than $10 million annually grew 50% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter alone, we closed 21 deals of $5 million or more in total contract value including 12 deals worth $10 million or more. Looking at revenue by segment. Government revenue accelerated in the fourth quarter growing 85% year-over-year to $190 million. We signed several large deals in the quarter including a three-year $44 million expansion with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and a two-year $31 million agreement with the NHS. In addition, we announced that the U.S. Army executed its first option year with approximately $114 million as part of our partnership on the Army Vantage program. For the full year 2020, government segment revenue grew 77% year-over-year to $610 million and represented roughly 56% of our total revenue. Fourth quarter commercial segment revenue totaled $132 million, up 4% year-over-year, while full year commercial segment revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $482 million, and we continue to see strong momentum in our U.S. commercial business heading into 2021. U.S. commercial revenue rose 107% year-over-year in fiscal 2020 aided by our ongoing investments in our account-based sales force and channel partnerships. In the fourth quarter, we signed several large deals including a nine-figure renewal with BP, exemplifying our software\u2019s enduring impact and value even in a sector that has been fundamentally challenged as of late. Also in the fourth quarter, we signed eight additional deals with at least $10 million in our commercial segment. I\u2019ll next discuss our margins and expenses on an adjusted basis, which includes stock-based compensation. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 84%, up 1,200 basis points versus the year-ago period, and full-year adjusted gross margin was 81%, up 1,000 basis points, compared with full year 2019. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was driven by increased automation and efficiency in the delivery of our software. Contribution margin with 62% in the fourth quarter, nearly double the contribution margin of 33% in the year-ago quarter, which highlights the efficiencies we have generated in customer acquisition and contract execution. Turning to our operating expenses. Total fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses were $186 million, which includes approximately $19 million in employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation. Excluding these expenses, total fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses would have been $167 million. Fourth quarter operating income excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes was $104 million representing an adjusted operating margin of 32%. The outperformance in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by a higher than expected revenue quarter, continued efficiencies in our go-to-market, and delivery in main server software as well as reductions in cloud hosting costs. Full year 2020 adjusted operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and non-recurring expenses related to our direct listing was $190 million, representing a margin of 17%. As we noted last quarter, we have historically pursued multi-year upfront payments from our customers, which has led to significant growth in contract liabilities in prior periods such as billings and cash collections often exceeded revenue. Over the course of 2020, we\u2019ve moved away from our practice of collecting multiple years of upfront payments which have led to lower 2020 cash collections and a greater portion of our revenue coming from the recognition of such contract liabilities. We expect this to begin to normalize over the course of 2021 with cash collections and revenue moving more in parallel over time, which will drive positive cash flow from operations for the year. We measure revenue visibility across several metrics. First, we ended 2020 with a total deal value across the business of $2.8 billion while the year-end dollar-weighted average contract duration was 3.6 years. This growth rate is particularly strong when considering government customers entered into shorter than usual contracts in 2020 to accelerate procurement as they responded to the COVID crisis and move quickly on various monetization efforts across both defense and civilian agencies. We expect a tailwind for the government as these customers renew and expand. Second, our remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2020 was $597 million, up 124% year-over-year, while the current RPO increased 114% year-over-year. Although RPO provides a limited view into our business as many of our contracts across our government and commercial segments feature termination for convenience clauses, the growth in these metrics is representative of the ongoing and momentum we are seeing in our business. Third, we look at the annual contract value booked in year on a dollar-weighted duration basis. In 2020, the dollar-weighted annualized contract value we closed increased 49% t year-over-year, providing a strong foundation for fueling growth in 2021 and beyond across both our commercial and government segments. Looking at the business through the lens of our three-phase model, we ended the year with strong performance across all three cohorts. Our Acquire phase customers ended 2020 generating $77 million in revenue with a 17% contribution margin with nearly half of the revenue from these customers coming in the fourth quarter. This rapid scaling and expanding contribution margin demonstrates the increasing efficiency of our customer acquisition and onboarding process, which we believe will help fuel an expanding pipeline into 2021 and beyond. Expand phase customers continue to see increasing value in our software platforms yielding consistent upsell and cross-sell opportunities. These customers generated $360 million in revenue for the full year 2020 with a contribution margin of 47%. This represents over 100% year-over-year growth for this customer cohort and this growth was extremely efficient as these customers generated a contribution margin of negative 43% in fiscal year 2019. Finally, our scale-phase customers continue to demonstrate a strong combination of growth and profitability as these customers generated $613 million in revenue and 70% contribution margin in 2020, representing 8% year-over-year growth and a 1,500 basis points expansion in contribution margin compared with the same customers in fiscal year 2019. In addition, for the full-year 2020, we generated $42 million in revenue from new customers we acquired in year of which $19 million was recognized in the fourth quarter. This compares with $4 million in the fourth quarter fiscal year 2019 and represents 375% growth year-over-year. You heard from Karp about our long-term orientation. As we move into the future, we believe our investments will help us sustain elevated growth rates for the next five years and beyond as we pursue a broad range of opportunities across our commercial and government segments. For our five-year outlook, we expect greater than $4 billion in revenue in 2025. Starting in 2021, we expect greater than 30% annual revenue growth each year for the next five years. And in Q1 of this year, we expect revenue growth of 45% or $332 million at the midpoint and we expect adjusted operating margin of 23% for the quarter. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rodney to open up Q&A. A - Rodney Nelson : Thanks, Dave. John, Dave and Kevin will join me for Q&A today. And we\u2019ll begin with some shareholder questions from say, Shyam; I\u2019ll start with you on this first question. Palantir is guiding for double-digit percentage growth this year. Can Palantir sustain such a compound growth rate, barring any unforeseen negative economic impacts or should investors expect choppy yearly growth numbers. Can you comment on a long-term expected growth rate? Shyam Sankar : I\u2019ll build on what Karp said earlier in the call on long-term guidance. We are very much at the beginning here. We just did 45% growth in 2020. We expect to do \u2013 sorry, 47% growth in 2020. We expect to do 45% growth in Q1 of 2021 and we are only in 24 of the global 300. But I think looking at that kind of misses the point around the TAM expansion, that\u2019s currently happening. Look at the channel partnership with Fujitsu and IBM among others, where we\u2019re not just distributing to the top 300 or the top 1,000, but really, we have the ability now to distribute to the entire market, potentially tens of thousands of customers. And with our investments in the end-to-end, sensor-to-shooter workflows from space to mud, we\u2019re not just going after the roughly, $60 billion of government IT spend anymore, we\u2019re talking about the quarter-trillion dollars of U.S. DoD weapons system spend in 2020. And our product investments mean that we are uniquely positioned to seize those opportunities. Broadening the market is not about Palantir life, it\u2019s about Palantir Automated. It\u2019s about the power of Apollo, it\u2019s about software that manages itself. Look \u2013 look at our archetypes investments like this means with a few clicks, you can deploy end-to-end powerful use case. Use cases that would have cost millions of dollars and taken many months can now be deployed in minutes. It\u2019s about software-defined data integration and modularity. That means that you get 100% of the power of Palantir, but with the ease of self-managing software. And these are examples of why we\u2019re confident in our long-term growth of being greater than $4 billion in 2025. Rodney Nelson : Great. So, the next question is on Demo Day and I\u2019ll stick with you, Shyam. Could you \u2013 can you please share how Demo Day was received by potential customers and would the Palantir experience a surge of interest in its products specifically on the commercial side of the business? Shyam Sankar : Yes. Demo Day was a hit with potential customers. We were very excited by the marked uptick in inbound inquiries. And \u2013 and these have led to some great generative conversations with prospective customers. Demo Day really helped customers understand if they had a problem that Palantir can solve, and it kept our growing sales force pretty busy. But it really underscores the tremendous opportunity in front of us and how much we are at the beginning. One of the reflections that I had about Demo Day is that we tried to do an all-purpose Foundry demo. But the truth is that Foundry can solve so many, many problems. So, we\u2019re going to be hosting a \u2013 another event in April, Demo Day DoubleClick. We\u2019re going to spend more time on Foundry, focused on more use cases across more industries. So, stay tuned for that formal announcement and registration details. Rodney Nelson : Great. Kevin, I\u2019ll come to you on this next one. Will big company deals such as the IBM announcement become more common as Foundry\u2019s price become more apparent to the public? Also, is there any timeframe or chance for widely available, bullet-technical medium-sized businesses or consumer-level software? Kevin Kawasaki : Thank you, Rodney. So, yes, we\u2019re excited about this partnership as well. I\u2019ll start with the small and medium-sized businesses. In short, yes, Shyam just talked about how our TAM is expanding that we\u2019re automating the delivery of Foundry. This means you can have full end-to-end use cases with no code, just drag, and drop. And the result of this is that we can deliver the full power of our products to small, medium, and of course, large institutions. And it\u2019s important to note here that the unit economics really allow for us to do this, 84% adjusted gross margin in Q4 last year, 62% contribution margin in Q4. So, of course, partnerships like IBM adding salespeople to scale and distribution just made a lot of sense, right. Rodney Nelson : Great. Shyam, I\u2019ll come at \u2013 I\u2019ll come back to you on this next one. It seems like the bulk of your channel partnerships are focused on the enterprise of the commercial segment. What are the near-term opportunities to broaden the channel that government side overall growth there need to be directly sourced? Shyam Sankar : We are aggressively pursuing partnerships with large primes. But these partnerships, they\u2019re specifically focused on partnering with the divisions that build hardware platforms. The folks that build aircraft, submarine, land vehicles, space-based platforms, drone, ship, and other weapons systems. And the focus of these partnerships is to explore putting Palantir\u2019s unique AI capabilities, capabilities that have already been proven in the field and retrofitting them onto existing programs of record and taking them in from inception into future programs. And so this is going to manifest in something that looks like Palantir inside of every missile, inside of every drone, Palantir of the edge inside of every sensor in every shooter. And we\u2019re approaching these partnerships in a unique way with the commercial item. So, that means, of course, we get to leverage the commercial item preference 2377. But I think much more importantly, this creates a massive opportunity for the primes themselves to generate high-margin, recurring software revenue businesses by partnering with us against their installed base. And in talking with them, it seems like one of the reasons that they\u2019re most excited about it this is that they see this in the face of shrinking defense budgets as a way of driving their own multiple expansion and growing their market cap. This is massively TAM-expanding for Palantir. As I mentioned earlier, this is us not just going after government IT spend, but actually, we\u2019re now entering into \u2013 enable to address the roughly $0.25 trillion of DoD weapons system spend. And I think this represents a revolutionary opportunity for our joint customers in terms of capabilities that they can get. Rodney Nelson : Great. Dave, I\u2019ll come to you on this next one. In terms of profitability, when does Palantir expect to achieve a level, where it can repeatedly and continually achieve profitability? Does Palantir need to hit the targeted 6,000 Foundry clients along with other revenue sources from other platforms to become meaningfully profitable? Dave Glazer : On profitability, and Kevin just briefly touched on it. but I\u2019d point you to our margins today. 84% adjusted gross margin in Q4, 81% for full-year 2020, 62% contribution margin in Q4, 54% for full-year 2020, 32% adjusted operating margin in Q4, 17% for the full year. We have proven the unit economics this year and we did it in a year, where we did 47% growth. And this is why we\u2019re going to continue investing in that growth. And it\u2019s just really, really like a massive opportunity ahead of us. Rodney Nelson : Great. Shyam, I\u2019ll come back to you before we open the call for \u2013 for more Q&A. While the IBM announcement is great, their public cloud share is relatively small. Can you commit to expanding managed offerings to other cloud providers such as \u2013 such as Microsoft, Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, et cetera? Shyam Sankar : Let\u2019s start with Apollo, because it \u2013 it\u2019s crucial technology. Apollo means that we can run our software efficiently anywhere. In your cloud, in my cloud, and their cloud, you know, in space, on a drone, on a Humvee. The customer of the future should not have to worry about this. It will run wherever you need it to seamlessly. It\u2019s also important to understand that the vast majority of our new customers are taking advantage of the speed, security, and reliability of our SaaS offering and we have committed to spending over $1 billion on cloud providers. So, we\u2019re operating these offerings that scales with the providers. And I mean, just to give you a \u2013 a sense of that, it turns out actually there are limits to how Elastic Compute actually is. We got a call we never thought we\u2019d get, one of the providers calling us to let us know that they were out of servers. So, of course, we\u2019re working with all these providers in all of these places. But maybe, more interestingly is to think about how do we think about these providers to us, their channels. Our offering is an end-to-end solution that : one, delivers a rapid amount of value to our customers; but two, it drives a massive amount of cloud consumption for these providers. And so we\u2019re going to continue focusing on working with the providers that generate the most growth for us, where we have a joint go-to-market. So, it\u2019s worth watching the space. Rodney Nelson : Great. Operator, we\u2019ll turn it over to you for our next question. Operator : Certainly. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Good morning. The $4 billion revenue target for 2025, can you just walk through the assumptions that \u2013 that you are making to achieve that target, and what gives you the confidence to achieve this? This is obviously a \u2013 a pretty big target and few companies in the industry give this type of target. Maybe if you could just talk to that. Thank you. Shyam Sankar : You bet. Thanks, Brent. So, just kind of starting off reiterating some of the numbers that we gave here. Yes, 47% revenue growth last year, expected 45% growth in Q1. What\u2019s driving this? And that gives us the confidence looking forward. So, yes, the product investments that we\u2019ve made, along with direct sales force, now channel partnerships, really fuels the distribution. And you can see this in the data, 110% revenue growth in our U.S. commercial market, 91% revenue growth in U.S. government, both last year. Revenues from new accounts as Dave mentioned in Q4 grew 375%. Our acquirer-phase customers grew over 200% in the second half of 2020 alone. The expand-phase customers were 100%. So, that\u2019s showing a lot about the strength of our new account pipeline and how we land and expand? Our average revenue per customer grew 41% to $7.9 million. And I think we \u2013 we talked about this already but probably worth reiterating, we did our 47% growth last year while increasing our margin. 84% adjusted gross margin, 62% contribution margin, up from 33% last year that nearly doubling in one year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Thanks, everyone. Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and very nice quarter. I think it was probably a question for Dave. And just kind of helping us better understand in the income statement. On one side of the equation, can you help us better understand kind of \u2013 some of the volatility we see in revenue growth? Commercial revenue growth slowed down a lot into Q4 versus Q3. Sounds like, over the full year, you did really well. So, can you explain to us how we see that volatility? Because I think software investors are used to seeing a lot of recurring revenues and pretty smooth revenue trends there. So, one, could help us understand kind of that bouncing around the revenue growth. And two, on the OpEx side of the equation. OpEx for the quarter was down \u2013 the adjusted OpEx was down almost 30% year-on-year, for the full year, it\u2019s down 20%. I know T&E is a big chunk of that probably about half of it. But given like the huge opportunity, still very early days, you guys have such a lead in terms of technology, why are you investing in it so low? Like why is OpEx down on a year-on-year basis versus really aggressively investing for it if it\u2019s an opportunity on a go-forward basis? Shyam Sankar : Well, I\u2019ll start with things, Keith, this is Shyam, and I\u2019m jumping in on the OpEx one. Really what you\u2019re seeing there is the payoff of our long-term investments in the product. So, last year, Apollo delivered a massive step-change in terms of both cost of revenue and the efficiency around sales and marketing and how we acquired customers in our three-phase model. On top of that, with the software-defined data integration and the investments in archetypes allowing us to capture business, shrinking the duration of pilots, shrinking the investment that was required which drove down sales and marketing. And that reduced, of course, on the other end, the cost of revenue. And then the second component that you\u2019re seeing outside of product is the investment in the direct sales force, which for us has paradoxically reduced the unit cost around sales and marketing. It\u2019s cheaper for us to acquire customers by building out the direct sales force. So, you should expect to see, of course, a very significant investment in that going forward. But if invested on a much more efficient base and you\u2019ll see that spend go up here. Now, in terms of commercial customers there, I \u2013 it was a big year for commercial customers. A lot of expansion, the right way to look at this from our perspective is the amount of growth that we had in U.S. commercial, the place that we have invested significantly in our direct sales force here. And that resulted in 107% growth. And then when you look at the investments that we\u2019re making with channel partnerships, Fujitsu in Japan, IBM Worldwide, distribution in 180 countries, adding as many folks and effectively a week to our sales forces we have, employees at Palantir, we\u2019re feeling really good about what we should be expecting from commercial going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Merwin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Christopher Merwin : Okay. Thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the modularization of Foundry. Obviously, it\u2019s a very powerful platform, and your pre-packaging need solutions, which just sounds like you need so much more easily that way. Can you talk a bit about how that might change the competitive set for you if at all? Are you mainly focused on use cases that are generally not served by other horizontal DoD spenders today? Thanks. Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Chris. It\u2019s a great question. We\u2019re very much focused on modularizing of Foundry in a way that creates a unique set of offerings underneath it. I\u2019ve personally been talking with customers and prospective customers around these modules and there\u2019s a huge amount of excitement from them around it because really it allows them to leverage their existing investments, things that they spent many years building that they\u2019re quite happy with that are core components of their business. But it also allows them to accelerate their modernization journey by leveraging components that we offer that are completely unique. And we\u2019re going to continue to be focused on offering modules that we perceive as being unique, the market perceives as being unique and that allow us to meet the customers where they are. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much and congrats. Really strong results, guys. I guess, I wanted to ask more about the triple-digit growth in sales headcount that you mentioned. Can you just maybe remind us how much of demand in Q4 or perhaps in 2020 was captured explicitly by sales heads versus forward-deployed engineers? How does that progress and how should we think about the hiring cadence and productivity ramp of these reps that you intend to hire? Shyam Sankar : Yes. So, I think, roughly, I could think of good way thinking about this is about half of incremental growth is now being driven by our investments in the direct sales force and channel partnerships and we expect that can grow pretty substantially here. But the places where we\u2019ve had the most growth, U.S. government, U.S. commercial, that is way more than half. In terms of productivity ramp, I think we\u2019ll be ready to comment in that in future periods, but what we\u2019re seeing is a marked compression in how long it\u2019s taking to ramp our reps and get them to be productive. And we\u2019re also seeing \u2013 this is happening at a time where there\u2019s just a lot more demand in the market, there\u2019s a lot more inbound coming to us. So, we\u2019re pretty excited about ramping the reps and ramping the hiring as quickly as possible to meet that demand. Operator : That concludes the Q&A. And I would like to take this time to thank everybody for joining and you may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day, everybody.",

Palantir\u2019s press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on Palantir\u2019s Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rodney. Rodney Nelson : Thanks, Jacko. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Shyam Sankar, Chief Operating Officer, Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer and Kevin Kawasaki, Global Head of Business Development Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. I'll turn the call over to Shyam to get us started. Shyam Sankar : Thank you, Rodney. Cutting-edge product and continued efficiencies and distribution drove exceptionally strong Q1 results. Adjusted free cash flow was $151 million, a 44% margin, and this was an increase of $441 million over the year ago quarter. Revenue was up 49%, billings grew 248%, RPO grew 129%. We had 76% growth in duration adjusted commercial deal value. We had an adjusted operating margin of 34%. And our US business across government and commercial continues to be on fire growing at 81%. These results and for that matter our future results wouldn't be possible without our relentless focus on product innovation. The area I'm most excited about is the development of Apollo for Edge AI. This was demonstrated at the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah this past April, just last month. This is live now. We are pioneering approach that we call micro models. Just like micro services are the basis of modern software architectures, we believe that micro models are how you operationalize AI at scale for enduring advantage. There is no place, this is more true than in our US government work on some of the hardest and most important problems facing our nation. Apollo for Edge AI is the next evolution to transform AI into alpha, enabling customers to train, manage and deploy multiple independently versioned chained models to the Edge with ease. Customers will have maximum flexibility to decompose a task into multiple models, where each component can be improved and upgraded in isolation, and subsequently dynamically chained together even if links in that chain are running across multiple platforms from space to mud and across different sensors and shooters, making the sum of the parts greater than the whole. This is operational AI in action at the Edge, its decision advantage delivered. And we are seeing incredible interest here from commercial customers to leverage this same innovation using AI models on the factory floor to augment human workers or more efficiently detecting wildfire risk from space to next-generation of predictive maintenance occurring at the Edge, on board the airplane while still in flight, understand, decide and act at the Edge. Turning to results. Where the government response to the pandemic has been efficacious, we are seeing a commercial tailwind. In the US in particular, we continue to generate exceptional results where revenue grew 83% in the US government and 72% in commercial, and we have a lot of headroom for growth in these markets. We only have a handful of Fortune 500 customers and less than one tenth of a percent of annual defense spending. We have widened and are continuing to widen our capability to distribute our product. We see strength and forward looking indicators and customer interest. Since the beginning of February, qualified commercial opportunities in the US and the UK are up 2.5 times. Active commercial pilots across the business have more than doubled and opportunities across the US and UK government continue to develop at pace. We added 11 new commercial customers and we also announced our partnership with MD Anderson and Syntropy. And it's not just established industry players where we are winning. We are seeing opportunities for companies to build their digital infrastructure around foundry from day zero, where they can shave years off their ramps and mountains of risk off their roadmaps by cost efficiently standing on the shoulders of 15 years and more than $2 billion of R&D. And we see this as the first salvo in expanding distribution of foundry to broader markets and a broader set of customers. In Q1 we entered into a partnership with Lilium, a revolutionary eVTOL transportation company that will use foundry to build an integrated business from the ground up, incorporating design and engineering, procurement, testing, production, quality, logistics and in-service operations. We've also partnered with Sarcos. We've always talked about Gotham, is the digital Iron Man suit. Well, these guys, they're building the physical Iron Man suit. Sarcos will leverage foundry for all of Palantir\u2019s well understood industrials and manufacturing use cases. But you can see how Sarcos can leverage all the capabilities of Apollo for Edge AI to push AI into their exoskeletons. This is Jarvis, Tony Stark's digital assistant, but in real life. These customers and even more prospects in our pipeline are at the forefront of the next major sea change in software, architecting an entire organization around a common operating picture to deliver a connected company from the very beginning, eliminating the chains of silo data and systems. We are investing in innovation in the West, backing companies with ambitious goals and executing on our ability to move down market. And the fit is natural, our software can radically accelerate production ramps and time to market and help these companies get to scale on dramatically shorter time horizons. In parallel, the momentum in our government business continues unabated. First quarter government revenue increased 76% year-over-year, fueled in large part by the 83% year-over-year growth we generated in the US government. We continue to play a critical role in helping governments respond to the pandemic and further our mission to become the central operating system for defense. The scope of our government work is broadened on the back of cutting edge product, like Apollo for Edge AI and investments in distribution. In the first quarter, we were awarded a 5-year contract worth up to $90 million with the National Nuclear Security Administration to provide the operating platform to safeguard America's nuclear stockpile. Of course, our nation's nuclear assets are crucial importance to the future of our nation's and broader western security and we are proud to partner on this. As we look forward over the balance of the year, we continue to have tailwinds as we pursue opportunities across both defense and civilian agencies in our government business. In Q1 our software was leveraged in the Global Information Dominance Experiment, enabling all 11 DoD combatant commands to generate globally integrated strategic decision advantage from intelligence, operations, logistics and supply data, all advanced by AI. This work dovetails with the strong pipeline we see in our government business across a variety of defense initiatives. And we expect deal activity to increase over the course of the year. As we outlined in February, our plans to increase distribution include building a direct sales force, and we've made massive strides so far this year. In the first quarter alone, we've made nearly 50 hires into our sales team and the pipeline to continue growing this team remains robust. This puts us well on our way to achieving the goal of adding triple digit sales headcount this year, and applying much more force behind our businesses momentum. I mentioned earlier the growth of our customers and pilots. Our sales force combined with outreach and events are generating more high quality opportunities. What's more, customers are coming to us with a much deeper understanding of our products and the value they unlock, to the point where the first meeting today really now feels like the fourth or fifth meeting from a year ago. The flywheel is turning faster. In addition to our direct sales force expansion of channels is a critical element to our distribution strategy. We continue to pursue and invest in our channel partners across this spectrum from complimentary software companies to system integrators and cloud providers, across both the government and commercial segments. We announced our IBM partnership last quarter. The pace here is tremendous. We booked our first customers within 16 days of bringing the product to market. We believe there are significantly more opportunities with ISP partners in our future. We have continued to develop our reach with system integrators, developing targeted join go to markets and geographies, industries and functional areas. Today 15 different SIs are partnering with our customers to deliver work on our products. We continue to view cloud providers as channels. We have seen a marked shift, where cloud providers are integrating foundry into their reference architectures and core go to market activities. At the end of the day, you can either go to market with an architecture that theoretically solves a problem and for example, healthcare, but it's never actually been deployed. Or you can take the architecture, the NHS use to execute one of the worlds most successful at scale vaccination programs, or the architecture used by NIHs N3C to integrate a huge amount of clinical data for research on COVID in record time. These are battle tested blueprints for success that drive outcomes for customers and days. And importantly, for the cloud providers drive a rapid amount of consumption very, very quickly. On the government side, we are seeing more and more traditional defense contractors buying into our architecture, both for internal production and manufacturing of large programs, the same way that we would help say any manufacturer. But also to leverage our Apollo for Edge AI architecture into their AI enabled platforms to extend the life of these platforms, and to create software monetization for themselves through a joint offering. Really, our successful channel partners across government and commercial are the ones that are realizing that they're going to draft off our software\u2019s world class performance that has always met its movement. The blinding pace of both cutting edge product development and customer wins that drove these results they are delivered because every hobbits [ph] unquestionable resolve in the face of adversity, and categorical dedication to our customers and their mission. Thank you all Palantir\u2019s. A final note, while restarting is on our mind, the vicissitudes of the pandemic, and continuing to respond is where our hearts are. I want to reiterate that we stand ready to help, as always, any country or company at any phase. There are many regions and industries that still face existential crises and overcoming the pandemic and reforging their operations in this new reality. We stand ready to help. And you know, with that, I'll turn it over to Dave to take us through the financials. Dave Glazer : Thanks, Shyam. I'll now review our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook. Cutting edge product and increased efficiencies and distribution drove an exceptionally strong Q1 results. We generated revenue growth of 49%, bringing Q1 revenue to $341 million. Adjusted operating income increased to $117 million, representing a margin of 34%. And adjusted free cash flow increased to $151 million, representing a margin of 44% and a $441 million improvement from Q1 2020. This was backed by strong first quarter billings of $362 million, up 248% year-over-year. Looking at our revenue performance, our total first quarter revenue growth was 49%, ahead of our prior guidance of 45%. The combination of 49% revenue growth and 44% adjusted free cash flow margin is indicative of the unique underlying unit economics of our business. Our US business ended the first quarter with nearly $800 million annualized revenue run rate, as total first quarter US revenue increased 81%, representing 72% US commercial growth and 83% US government growth. Looking at revenue by segment, first quarter government revenue was $208 million, up 76%. US government revenue increased 83% year-over-year in the first quarter and international government revenue increased 57% year-over-year. We expect this momentum to continue, as we have a significant pipeline of government deals building in Q2 and beyond that we believe will fuel durable elevated growth in our government segment. First quarter commercial segment revenue totaled a $133 million, up 19% year-over-year, and we are seeing particular strength in the US, as US commercial revenue increased 72% year-over-year. In addition to that revenue growth, we're also seeing substantial increases in leads and new opportunities, and we've more than doubled the number of active pilots in our commercial business since February. Abroad and particularly in Europe, we're seeing more muted commercial growth in countries that are still facing significant health and economic challenges stemming from the pandemic. But as Shyam mentioned, we're continuing to invest in these regions to assist in their recovery, and we expect our business will accelerate as these regions recover. In the first quarter, we closed 15 deals of $5 million or more in total contract value, including six deals worth $10 million or more. We ended the first quarter with total remaining value of $2.8 billion, up 40% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligation was $626 million at the end of the first quarter, up 129% year-over-year. Average contract duration was 3.7 years, up from 3.6 years at the end of 2020. These results are particularly strong when considering government customers entered into shorter than usual contracts in 2020 to accelerate procurement as they responded to the COVID crisis. Moving through 2021, we expect these deals to renew and expand, which we believe will create tailwinds for both duration and deal value. First quarter trailing 12 month revenue per customer increased 29% year-over-year to $8.1 million. First quarter trailing 12 month revenue per top 20 customer\u2019s increased 34% year-over-year to $36.1 million and represented 60% of trailing 12 month revenue compared with 65% in the year ago period. As you move through 2021 and beyond and increased distribution across multiple channels, especially into new market segments such as middle market, and SMBs, we expect average revenue per customer growth to taper, reflecting our broadening customer base. Next, I'll discuss our margins and expenses on an adjusted basis, which excludes stock based compensation. First quarter adjusted gross margin was 83% up 800 basis points versus the year ago period. Contribution margin was 60%, up 1900 basis points versus a year ago period. First quarter income from operations, excluding stock based compensation and related employer payroll taxes was $117 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 34% significantly ahead of our prior guidance of 23%. In the first quarter, we generated $151 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing an adjusted free cash margin of 44%. As we continue to invest in our sales team, we expect related expenses to increase over the course of the year as these new heads come on board. With over $2.3 billion in cash on the balance sheet and strong free cash flow in Q1, we paid down our outstanding debt in early April, and expanded the availability under our revolver by $200 million for a total capacity of $400 million, all of which remains undrawn. This provides us with substantial flexibility to pursue investment initiatives in support of our long-term growth targets. For Q2 revenue guidance, we expect year-over-year revenue growth of 43% or $360 million, and we expect adjusted operating margin of 23% for the quarter. Additionally, for the full year 2021, we are raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance from breakeven to in excess of $150 million on the strength of our first quarter. Continuing to execute the guidance strategy set forth by our CEO, Alex Karp in our year end 2020 earnings call with regard to long term revenue guidance, we are providing and will continue to provide revenue guidance of greater than 30% for this year, and the next four years at each earnings call. And with that, I'll turn it over Rodney for Q&A. A - Rodney Nelson : Great. Thanks, Dave. So we'll begin Q&A with questions from our 1.5 million shareholders submitted through se. And Shyam, I'll start with you on this first one. Avi, asks. Unidentified Analyst : Does the company intend to turn into profit in 2021 or to keep using the current resources to expand? Shyam Sankar : First of all, congrats Avi on having the most voted on question. There are two numbers that we focus on. The first is adjusted free cash flow, which really is the business' ability to generate money - generate cash. And the other is adjusted operating income, which is a measure of profitability, excluding stock-based comp primarily. On cash flow, we had a swing of $441 million to deposit, generating $151 million of positive cash flow, a 44% adjusted cash flow margin. So this shows the business underlying financial strength. And on operating income, we had a 34% margin. This is demonstrating a software company that is efficiently distributing its products and shows tons and tons of product leverage. Not to mention, we're one point shy of our long-term targets that we established around the time of the listing. So it really shows that we can hit that. And so if you look at these two things together, we're proving the profitability and cash generation potential of the business. Sometimes in software, people talk about the rule of 40. The sum of your adjusted free cash flow margin and sum of your revenue growth should be greater than 40, right. Well, for us, that's 49% revenue growth in Q1, 44% adjusted free cash flow margin. That's 93%. That puts us in incredibly rare site area. We're in the top three of software companies for Q1. But I think actually, the most important thing is to realize that we're just at the beginning. We only have a handful of Fortune 500 companies. We are just starting to move down market to medium-size enterprises. Our government revenue is less than 10 basis points, less a tenth of a percent of US defense spending. We have so much exciting product vision to invest in. There's just a huge market to go after. And the most prudent thing to do is to invest aggressively to go after. And that's what we're doing. We are focused on profitability. We're focused on growth. We're focused on generating in excess of $4 billion in revenue in 2025, as Alex outlined earlier this year. Rodney Nelson : Great. Thanks, Shyam. I'll stick with you on this next one. We've gotten a few questions around the announcement, the investments that we've announced. Unidentified Analyst : So Jackson K. asks, why is Palantir choosing to invest in companies such as Lilium and Sarcos Robotics? Can you speak to the motivation behind these decisions and if investors can anticipate future corresponding investments? How do you view risk, investment size and potential return? Shyam Sankar : Thanks Jackson for the question. As I mentioned throughout the call, we are relentlessly focused on increasing distribution. And here, we see a unique opportunity with ambitious companies to invest in both compelling management teams and compelling businesses and to partner with them on using our software from day zero. These are folks that are focused on winning. There is no entrenched IT bureaucracy that wants to build their own toy like solution. They viscerally understand the value of buying the best operating system for their enterprise, shaving years and mountains of risk off their road map. That's not even to make mention of all the money they would have otherwise wasted buying traditionally siloed systems from CRM to ERP to manufacturing execution systems to some homegrown mini monster. Overall, we think this is a really compelling opportunity to accelerate our business, to accelerate our distribution and to bet on our customers. Rodney Nelson : Great. And maybe one more for you, Shyam, before going to the rest of the group. Unidentified Analyst : Jeffrey T. asks, what are your plans to compete with Microsoft in the coming quarters? Shyam Sankar : Thanks Jeffrey. Well, we don't compete with Microsoft or other software vendors or system integrators. We compete against our customers. We compete against our customers' desire to build their own bespoke solution. This is build versus buy. And you aren't actually buying with Microsoft or these other vendors. I mean, with Microsoft, remember Ballmer's famous meme, developers, developers, developers, or with AWS, look at their product marketing, it's about build, build better, build faster, build on AWS. The same for GCP and with system integrators, by definition, you're building. And yes, that's a challenge because our software shamanism means that we build something radically in the future, holistic in approach and stunning in its results. But it's also something that comes across as both heterodox to the high priest of IT and their reference architecture. But the proof is in the pudding when the pandemic hit and tore through our health systems and supply chain, the IT orthodoxes failed to deliver anything ameliorate. Foundry and Gotham delivered revolutionary capabilities in jaw droopingly short periods of time. Our battle tested, and I mean, that literally, our battle-tested architecture is competing against DIY market. And the pace we are innovating at continues to put distance between us and the next best alternative from archetypes that allow you to replace a year of custom integration with a few clicks over a few hours to Apollo for Edge AI that allows you to deliver the most sophisticated operational AI that is frankly just a few steps shy of Skynet. And as I mentioned earlier, we see the cloud providers, in particular, starting to incorporate these battle-tested architectures into their go-to-market motion and their offerings to their customers, precisely because selling undifferentiated LEGO bots isn't enough. Rodney Nelson : Great. Thanks, Shyam. Kevin, I'll come to you with this next one. It's kind of in the similar vein. Unidentified Analyst : Donatas asks, do you see Palantir becoming as crucial and impactful as Microsoft Office for businesses? If so when do you expect to reach that kind of adoption? Kevin Kawasaki : Thanks for the question. People should expect more from the modern operating purpose. For our customers, particularly in a time of great need, we're the most crucial and the most impactful software for any type of business. Our users aren't just in the office. They're on the front line, on the factory floor, at an airport, doctor\u2019s office, in a war zone. People use our product for their day-to-day job, their day-to-day mission. I think about a nursing home worker in Japan, who's caring for an aging population and needs to deliver preventative care. Workers at an airline routing thousands of flights or last year needing to find parking for thousands of aircraft. One of our customers is fighting wildfires in California, fire risk experts doing on the ground inspection with foundry. The United States and the United Kingdom governments are running two of the most successful vaccination programs in the world, and both are using foundry. In the UK thousands of users from physicians to administrators, nearly 2,500 vaccination sites, nearly 44 million vaccines. And every vaccine is ordered, allocated, tracked and delivered in foundry. In the United States, 257 million vaccines over 1,600 data sets, 50 states, 14 jurisdictions, pharmacies, manufacturers, foundry is the place for the federal government to understand vaccine supply and distribution chain from manufacturing to the jabs. Our products help our customers win, which is what is required of the modern operating system. Rodney Nelson : Thanks, Kevin. Shyam, I'll come back to you on this next one. Unidentified Analyst : Johan asks, your recent partnership with Faurecia, and the one before with Airbus shows your ability to work with that manufacturing clients. Is there any plan to develop that sector even further? Shyam Sankar : Thank you, Johan. Absolutely, manufacturing is a huge focus for us and it's an area of deep, deep strength historically. Just look at Chrysler. Every factory in North America on the factory floor, you will find foundry open to manage quality in real time. Manufacturing with chemical companies, mining, energy, suppliers across ecosystems in automotive, aerospace, I'll announce a new customer, auto manufacturing with Fuzhou. We have cutting-edge products and archetypes that deliver rapid value in managing working capital, procurement, production, demand forecast, supply chain management, quality, logistics, all the whole chain around manufacturing. And I call out companies like Lilium and Sarcos again that are going to build their operations around foundry from day 0, using foundry for ERP, CRM, manufacturing execution, for quality and much more. And our value here extends beyond manufacturing into sales and after sales, turning IoT and telemetry data into real value, not only for the OEMs, for the manufacturers, but for their suppliers and their customers. Rodney Nelson : Great. Dave, I'll come to you on this next question. We've gotten a few on these lines. Unidentified Analyst : Brian L asks, could you ever see Palantir having Bitcoin or any other type of cryptocurrency on its balance sheet? Dave Glazer : Brian, thanks for the question. The short answer is yes. We're thinking about it, and we've even discussed it internally. Take a look at our balance sheet, $2.3 billion in cash at quarter end, including $151 million in adjusted free cash flow in Q1. So it's definitely on the table from a treasury perspective as well as other investments as we look across our business and beyond. On the other side of that, in terms of accepting Bitcoin from our customers, we do accept it. That's more convenient. We're open for business there. Rodney Nelson : Great. Thanks, Dave. Shyam, coming back to your question about our work in healthcare. Unidentified Analyst : Conrad asks, does foundry have presence in early stage drug discovery and compound identification, not clinical trial data, but molecular properties, especially as pharma moves from small molecules to biologics? Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Conrad. Yeah, our life science work is growing very quickly, and we are absolutely working on the drug discovery end of it. I'd highlight our work with NCI, the National Cancer Institute, and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences at NIH, where we are doing lots of preclinical work. A small sliver, which was actually made public through published papers were Palantir and Palantirians are listed at. You can check out some of these from past ASCOs. Our work with MD Anderson spans not only obviously, clinical, but also preclinical work that we're doing, but more head on directly to just drug discovery. I'm proud to announce new partnerships with Roivant Sciences where we will work across their portfolio on drug discovery and development. And if you know anything about Roivant, they've invested a lot in computational approaches to drug discovery. With Celularity, we're going to help accelerate science around their breakthrough cell-based therapies and their cutting-edge biotechs that's focused on translating condensate biology into medicine. Rodney Nelson : Great. Thanks, Shyam. Kevin, I'll come to you on this next one, a question about the go to market. Unidentified Analyst : Jackson K asks, how is Palantir planning to expand downstream to medium-sized businesses? Since demo day and the kick-off of Double Click, has Palantir seen an increase in the interest from smaller companies? And if not, how can Palantir better demonstrate value to these businesses? Kevin Kawasaki : I mean, short answer is yes, we signed up a number of great small and medium-sized businesses recently. And I expect to see more of this because we're widening our distribution. A big driver of our Q1 results, that's 72% commercial growth in the United States and what's contributing to the revenue guide for Q2 is our increasing efficiencies of distribution. Our sales cycle is beating up. On demo day and Double Click, demonstrating our product publicly generates interest from all over, large global multinationals tuning in across their vast organization, smaller local regional companies are turning in to - tuning in to learn how foundry can provide an edge for their business, too. And this generates activity. We mentioned that our qualified pipeline has increased by two and a half times in the US and UK. And active commercial pilots across the business have more than doubled. And I think one of the most exciting things is that our shareholders are showing up in customer meetings. Of the 1.5 million individual shareholders, some are calling so they could bring foundry to their day to day job. Rodney Nelson : Great. Kevin, I'll stick with you as next question is in the similar vein. Unidentified Analyst : Christopher T. asks, with the recent announcement that Palantir is going to offer software to companies for free, how is Palantir getting this information out to Fortune 500 companies? Is Palantir reaching out to individual companies or are they waiting for - are we waiting for companies to come to us? Kevin Kawasaki : Thanks for this question. I suppose this is this is an opportunity to get the information out there. Over this last year, many of the most successful responses to the pandemic relied on effective data access through foundry. The purpose of Palantir unlock is to make foundry available to those who need it. I can remember about a year ago, when we were at the beginning stages of COVID-19, we knew that Palantir can make a huge impact, but we needed to help people learn this. So we began calling and calling and called city, state, local government, hospital, university research centers just to let them know that we have a technology that could help. I remember dialing into a state government. And finally, after several calls, finding the one person who's essentially trying to bring together data for the entire state with nothing more than a spreadsheet and a white board. Sitting in a war room, she was trying to figure out answers to critical question. How many hospital beds do we have? How long until we run out? How many ventilators? How long will they last? How do I get PPE to my health workers? And we're proud to say that this person had the power of foundry within hours and that is what we're offering here with unlock. Rodney Nelson : Great. So Shyam, on to next question, zooming out a little bit. Unidentified Analyst : Jose asks, what is Palantir's long-term identity, both be a data and AI company or will it try to be the leader in many parts of the tech industry? Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Jose. Well, we aspire to be the most important software company in the world. And some would say that we're well on our way. We help countries deter and respond to threats from totalitarian regime. We help prevent terrorism from destroying our way of life. We enhanced the protection of data, private ship and civil liberty to prevent the reaction to terrorism from destroying our way of life. We help governments manage public health. And broadly, we have helped organizations respond to the various shocks that would otherwise have been death-row. And we do this with completely unique software. Foundry is an operating system for the modern enterprise, Gotham as defense OS, these are generational shifts in capabilities and approach. Personal computing was stuck in time before the standardization of the right operating systems. Similarly, enterprises are stuck in our site without the right modern enterprise operating business. They are either drowning in the collection of siloed applications or they're just being sold a bunch of LEGO bots and a do-it-yourself dream. Personal computer hobby has tried to make their own operating systems too. We know how well that worked out. Alex sometimes said that we are software shaman. We have this track record of seeing around the corner and building what the world needs before the need is obvious. And the ability to even have perceived the need feels mystical, and its precedent when it meets the moment. And you're going to see this again with Apollo for Edge AI. Rodney Nelson : Great. Dave, I'll come to you with this next one. Unidentified Analyst : Louis asks, can you expand on Palantir's stock-based compensation will have further dilute the total shares of the company by increasing float each quarter and how much longer will significantly impact EPS? Dave Glazer : Thanks, Louis. We have very low dilution when looking at a fully diluted share count. So far this year, our share -- fully diluted share count has increased less than two-tenths of a percent so really, really low. With respect to SBC, it will normalize over the next couple of years as we're working through this outstanding overhang. And at the same time, when you couple that with the topline growth, we're going to continue to make progress toward profitability. Shyam Sankar : I would just add that. Obviously, everything Dave said is right here. The 20 basis point shows the discipline with which we are managing dilution. But just to zoom us out for a second here, like, why do we have stock-based comp in the first place. Equity is the fundamental investor employee alignment. We want, and frankly, you should want employees working their asses off with a long-term orientation to grow the value of the company. And so yes, we plan to continue granting equity to our employees and providing them opportunities to share a meaningful upside in the company in order to maximize your shareholder value. Rodney Nelson : Great. Dave, I'll stick with you. Unidentified Analyst : Jason B. asks, why does Pop Karp keep selling its shares? Dave Glazer : Jason, thanks for the question, and nice Pop Karp reference. We'll call him Alex here. So first off, Alex is one of our largest stockholders, but he has two large option grants that are expiring at the end of December that can't be extended. And so when he goes and exercises these options, it's going to create a very, very large stock build just to exercise in holding shares. And as a result, we've seen tax motivated sales as well as many corresponding exercises for shares that he will continue to hold. And even after this, he'll continue to be one of our largest stockholders. If you're interested in the nitty-gritty, you can check our filings if you want more detail. Rodney Nelson : Great. Shyam, I'll come to you with this next one before we open up the call. Unidentified Analyst : Emil asks, experience of Palantir software appears more often now on job postings. Would you consider creating courses or tutorials on how to use your software, access to of course we've given incentive for the employees to request the software for their companies. Could you comment on that? Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Emil. Indeed, the number of job postings for roles that require contract experience, they're growing every day, and that has really accelerated. Now that we have 15 large system integrators who are hiring, training and building practices around foundry, and we've built robust training to enable these system integrators to build billion-dollar lines of businesses around foundry. But to your question, we want to do even more here, especially work in help with restarting economies and returning to full employment. So we're planning to make foundry training available free to veterans of U.S. and allied militaries, to all of our individual shareholders and to anyone who is unemployed in the markets that we operate in. We are really excited about this. And we hope that it will make a meaningful contribution to restarting and reopening. So stay tuned for more details around this in the coming weeks. Rodney Nelson : Great. Operator, we'll open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Chris Merwin : All right. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter here. I wanted to ask about the commercial business. It looks like growth improved from last quarter, still below 20%. But I know there's a lot that you've been working on there, including the modularization of foundry and wanted to hear how that was resonating with customers. And then just the second part of the question would be around the customer add. It looks like you added 11 new customers on the commercial side in the quarter. Did most of this come from IBM or are those through your direct sales force? Thanks. Kevin Kawasaki : Great. Thanks, Chris. Yeah, the commercial business is gaining more and more momentum. As we mentioned, it grew 72% in the US. So what we're seeing is where economies are opening, there's just incredible traction there. We've hired 50 sales folks in the last quarter. You're starting to see that translate through in terms of activity two and a half times the number of qualified opportunities in the US and the UK, double the number of commercial pilots, the product investments that we've made around modularization and archetypes, those are what are translating also into increased activity. It's what's fueling our ability to do substantially more pilots here. The channel strategy is also helping us source more customers. The IBM partnership generated its first deal within 16 days of being launched there. So lots of momentum there, a place that we'll continue investing in. Overall, we're quite excited. We continue to win deals in Europe. Pharencia, Lilium in Europe, Fuzhou, Engi, so a bunch of momentum there. And as Europe starts to open and manage through the pandemic, we're also expecting the same sort of tailwind that we've seen in the US, in Europe. Chris Merwin : Thanks so much. Operator : And your next question will come from Parvi Provokzian from Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Hey, thanks. It's Brent Thill at Jefferies. On the government business, there's a lot of questions about the sustainable strength post-COVID. And what you're seeing, I think you said in the past that COVID has opened the door to many conversations, but there's a considerable amount of long tail of that. If you could just talk to what you're seeing as you look out? Thank you. Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Brent. That's absolutely right. There are a lot of things that got started as a result of COVID, but many of those things were not related to COVID response per se. It's really the fact that something had to be delivered, and it had to work in days, it showed many of the customers where their bespoke, custom-build approach was just never going to get there and allow them to mark-to-market whether a faster buy solution was going to work. And so we've seen that across the business, of course, the work with the National Nuclear Security Administration is not directly COVID related at all, but it's certainly accelerated by this. We've seen work across healthcare, DoD, civilian agencies, accelerate inside the US and outside of the US. We've also seen that the pipeline is continuing to build there. We're expecting a lot of defense-related activity to build over the back half of the year and into next year. We participate in the global information dominance experiment with 11 combat command, that was not even visible during the contact that we build here. So quite excited about the pace at which these things are building. And if you think about Apollo for Edge AI, most of the capabilities we're looking at, they didn't even exist around the time of the listing, like the pace at which we are innovating on the product is probably one of the most exciting things and that is what is creating these opportunities that are compounding. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter, especially with those new commercial customer adds. I had a question on kind of the margin side of the equation. And how we should be thinking about expense growth throughout the remainder of the year. So maybe to you, David. You did close to over $150 million of free cash flow in Q1. You're guiding for that figure for the full year. How should we use that to sort of guide our expectations on how that OpEx cost brand throughout the year? And how should we think about that on a go-forward basis? What's the investment philosophy if you will behind Palantir over the next couple of years as you look to sustain that 30% plus growth? Dave Glazer : Absolutely, absolutely. So as you noted, we had a very strong quarter, 49% revenue growth, 44% adjusted free cash flow margin and 34% adjusted operating margin. There's nothing noteworthy to call out on the expense side. Top line being obviously a contributor there. Overall, super pleased with the results. It shows the underlying unit economics. Let's look ahead to Q2, very strong revenue guide of 43% growth, coupled out with 23% operating margin, while at the same time, we're really going to be investing into the business, investing in sales hires, investments around the sales team, continued investment in the product and R&D, a lot of what Shyam talked about. And we're going to be focused on reopening. We think it's really important to get the company back in the offices to get people together and focus on culture. Operator : And your next question will come from Alex Zukin from Wolfe. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thank you for the question. I wanted to ask clearly, the confidence in the commercial revenue growth is high given the rep hiring that you guys are putting up. Can you talk about the divergence in pilots in the commercial sector versus the stated revenue growth? And when will those pilots convert to revenues? How visible is that conversion time line, et cetera? Kevin Kawasaki : Yes. We're quite excited by the teeth [ph] at which our hires are being accomplished, the ramp that we're seeing for those tires. We're also seeing just a kind of aggregate flywheel acceleration where the ramps are getting faster, the activity, converting into revenue is getting faster. So generally I would agree like we are feeling very bullish, and we're seeing that there. The pilots themselves are compressing in terms of how long they're taking because of the investments made in product modularization, archetypes, these allow us to structure the products in a way that something that would have taken three months to four is now a week or less. This is giving us a lot more capacity to cost efficiently distribute the product, accomplish these pilots and turn the revenue crank here. And so we're seeing very high returns to the sales force we're building. We want to keep doing more here. Look for that to accelerate even further in the back half of the year. And the conversion, we're really happy with it. I think when I just think about the two and a half x qualified pipeline that's been created since February 1, and then I think about the doubling of the pilot we're seeing about a third of those have already turned into something. And so as we build bigger and bigger pipeline here, we're feeling good about how that funnel is flowing through. And if you combine that with the additional product investments, the road map that we're executing on, we have every reason to believe that we're going to continue to see acceleration across all these dimensions. Operator : This brings us to the end of our audio Q&A session. I turn the call back over for closing remarks. Rodney Nelson : Thank you all for joining us. We're excited about the quarter. Thank you for waking up early. We'll talk to you all soon. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This will conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Joining me on today's call or Shyam Sankar Chief Operating Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Kevin Kawasaki, Global, Head of Business Development. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. I will turn the call over to Shyam to get us started. Shyam Sankar : Thank you, Rodney. Before diving into results, I'd like to share a bit of our latest product innovation, something that we deployed at the Global Information Dominance Experiments, GIDE 3 last month. We call it the meta-constellation, and it's radically changing how satellites are tasked, the latency of collection, and it's creating a fundamental link in that AI-enabled decision chain. Overnight, we orchestrated a meta-constellation of 237 satellites by working with an array of commercial space companies. These companies have been deploying constellations of hyperspectral, radar, and elite sensors into orbit. And we're putting all of that power directly into the hands of the frontlines, empowering the edge. It's one of the largest collaborative sensor constellations ever to see operational news. Here to show us more is Shannon, who has led our work defining and building the AI-enabled decision chain. Shannon Morahan : Palantir's meta-constellation software harnesses the power of growing satellite constellations, deploying AI into space to provide insights to decision-makers here on Earth. Our meta-constellation integrates with existing satellites, optimizing hundreds of orbital sensors and AI models, and allowing users to ask time-sensitive questions across the entire planet. Important questions like, where are the indicators of wildfires, or how are climate changes affecting crop productivity? And when and where are naval fleets conducting operations? Meta-constellation pushes Palantir's Edge AI technology to a new frontier. As we all know, submarines present threats to the U.S. and its allies. And to protect strategic interest, allied forces need to track every submarine's deployment around the world. And at the forefront of this challenge are anti-submarine warfare officers. They turn to meta-constellation to monitor ports across the Pacific. Let me show you a little bit about what that looks like. In response to Allied monitoring requests, meta-constellation dynamically determined, which orbiting sensors are available. Integrated through Palantir, the constellations then collaboratively scheduled coverage over each port. Meanwhile, Apollo for Edge AI assigns tailored AI micro models to each satellite. Running onboard the satellite, the models will automatically find submarines and stream those insights directly to users. With the mission planned, Apollo automatically reconfigures each of the satellites, pushing the right micro models into orbit. And as a software payload on board, Palantir's Edge AI platform connects complex satellite subsystems to models integrating new AI with the hardware. The best part, my favorite part is that as it orbits, the Edge AI platform hot-swaps the right micro models in, rapidly reconfiguring the satellite. The models process imagery, they detect submarines, geo-locate them, and then determine any movement since the last collection passed, all in under a second. When the AI sees a submarine movement, that insight is directly downlinked to allied forces as the satellite passes overhead, and the anti-submarine warfare officers are notified in just minutes, empowering them to respond in a way that we've never seen before. As you can tell, we're really excited about Palantir's meta-constellation and see it as the software that brings hundreds of satellites to bear on your hardest problem. Whether it's the anti-submarine warfare officer that I just described using it to find submarines, or first responders leveraging AI to spot wildfire signs. Meta-constellation is there to empower users. Shyam Sankar : Thank you, Shannon. Cutting-edge product and continued efficiencies and distribution drove exceptionally strong year-over-year Q2 results. Total revenue grew 49% in Q2. U.S. commercial revenue accelerated to 90%, second quarter TCB book rose 175% year-over-year to $925 million. We added 20 net new customers in Q2 alone, while generating $7.9 million of average revenue per customer. The average revenue of the top 20 customers grew sequentially quarter-over-quarter from $36 million to $39 million. The number of commercial customers grew 32% over last quarter. We closed 62 deals of a million dollars more, 30 of which were for $5 million or more and 21 were for $10 million or more. For the first half, we grew revenue 49%. We generated 28% adjusted free cash flow and a 33% adjusted operating margin. And visibility into future growth is strong, as total deal value increased 63% to $3.4 billion. Product innovation is at the core of these results and the momentum that's driving our business forward. You just saw how innovations on Edge AI delivered through Apollo or transforming the capabilities of our customers. We recently completed a number of crucial firsts for this technology, including running onboard advanced military helicopters and special operations fast boats. And just last week, our Edge AI was inferencing from space, 484 kilometers above our heads, truly from space to mud. Now, Apollo, our third platform, has always been our secret advantage. It enables us to take our SaaS offering to where no SaaS has gone before, drone, sub, satellites, classified networks, and on-premises without losing the efficiencies in the scalability of a centrally managed SaaS solution. We've been able to meet our customers where they are. And now, we're going to help our customers meet their customers where they are by commercializing Apollo itself. We are hearing from established software companies that have these large installed bases of on-prem customers, but they're investing other future R&D in cloud-only solutions. They have a problem, a big one, where a core part of their key large enterprises and government customers, they're not going to upgrade to the cloud, they require on-prem deployments. At one Fortune 500 prospect alone, we've identified $0.25 billion to a $0.5 billion with upsells that they're going to have to forego because the latest and greatest that they've developed only works in the cloud. And these specific customers require it to work on-premises. This Company can leverage our years of R&D in Apollo to enable their existing cloud-based SaaS software to run where the customer needs it with minimal effort. Leveraging the same DevOps and SRE teams who run all of their cloud-native offerings to run this as well. Apollo makes running on-prem feel like running in the cloud. We expect to start to do a lot more here as the sheer expanse of the last 15 years of R&D, investments that sought to see around corners start to become commercialized. We continue to see distributional efficiencies, coupled with accelerating product innovation for established companies as well. For instance, one of the largest banks in Europe came to us with an urgent compliance challenge facing its retail banking arm. The bank has over 10,000 branches and needed to move quickly to match new regulatory requirements and optimize anti-money laundering and compliance processes. In just two days, we were able to deploy an entire solution for this customer, leveraging our out-of-the-box functionality built in foundry, a timeline previously unthinkable in the eyes of the customer. And frankly, it would've been unthinkable to us even three years ago, where an equivalent project might have taken three months. This is only possible because of our product innovations from software-defined data integration are driving the marginal cost of data integration to 0, archetypes and our no-code technologies that are driving the marginal cost of application development to 0. All of this allows our customers to focus on solving the ever-evolving problem at hand from the outset, instead of wasting time wrangling legacy systems for months or years on end. It is exciting to see our technology being tasked with increasingly complex operational challenges and to see it deliver compounding wins for these customers in these scenarios. In mining, foundries deployed at one of Rio Tinto's state-of-the-art underground mining operations, an asset made up of five separate mine shafts comprising 200 kilometers of tunnels and reaching a maximum depth of 1.3 kilometers below the Earth surface. Rio is using foundry to build a digital mine to keep its employee safe and streamline operations. Sensor data will allow Rio to have pinpoint precision to monitor equipment performance, to measure geotechnical conditions, ensure the safety of its people underground. And they can do all of this from thousands of miles away in its Brisbane hub where caving experts are able to assist operations in the field. In energy, we're pioneering more ways to empower operational users to drive strategic outcomes. Our no-code technology is extending to real-time sensor data, enabling the frontline to easily create and manage their own multi-source sensor fusion at the speed of their operations. This is the shortest path from data to decision, real-time, high-consequence, high-skill environment. Whether it's Edge AI or Edge application, we are at the extreme edge. Our momentum in utilities continues to accelerate where the foundry platform has a unique fit and is delivering scaled value in weeks. In Q1, we announced our partnership with ENGIE and PG&E. In Q2, we added two more utilities, National Grid and Southern California Edison, where we are creating a connected utility from PSPS, that's Public Safety Power Shutoff, to procurement, to grid management and safety. More broadly, what we've really proven are the last few quarters. And that's really reflected in the tremendous growth of the commercial customer count, 32% growth in Q2, is that foundry is for everyone. The market is changing. I've talked about how COVID really showed where the emperor had no clothes. It isn't just the big established companies that took notice of it's bear assets. The young guns did too. And these young guns, they see foundry as an alternative to building the spoke solutions in AWS, or Azure, or any other cloud. They need software today that is ready for any tomorrow. Our software is that enabling platform. And a growing number of companies from early-stage to newly public companies, they're pursuing that vision on foundry. We refer to these organizations as day zero companies. The innovation in our distribution is enabling us to partner with these organizations across many industries as they build their offerings on foundry. For example, in biotech, Cellularity is leveraging our experience in both pharma R&D and manufacturing to accelerate drug development and set a new standard for cell-based therapies. Roivant is drawing on the work that we've done spanning pharma companies like Sanofi and Merck Group and public health platforms like N3C unite to pool and share trial data with development partners and build out real-world evidence capabilities to support key disease areas. In automotive Wejo is building a SaaS ecosystem, connected vehicle data spanning use cases across OEMs, suppliers, insurers. And government authorities on top of Foundry. In logistics, box is building a digital twin incorporating both shipment and sales operations, spending raw materials all the way through to end customers, and just so much more. We are making Foundry accessible to even more Day zero companies with Foundry for builders, the program which supports early-stage companies with access to Foundry, allowing these companies to build their operations on Foundry from the outset, enabling them not just to efficiently manage but actually to yield, the increasing complexity of their growing businesses to disrupting incumbents into win in the marketplace. Rodney Nelson : And while competitors are bought down by legacy IT investments in an obsession with reinventing every wheel internally, these companies, they have no IT catalog. They are just founders, entrepreneurs, and engineers focused on winning, and they see Foundry as the best way to do that. Shyam Sankar : This program includes companies like Chapter, which is revolutionizing the consumer experience in Medicare plans selection and enrollment, or Gecko Robotics is building badass robots for industrial inspections, and Origin Materials, which is helping companies de-carbonize their supply chains to achieve net 0 and, really, net negative carbon footprint. And we plan to extend this offering to more early-stage companies in a variety of industries over time. We see substantial opportunity to grow our business and push the ambition of our product with these Day Zero companies and we couldn't be more excited to power the next generation of builders. And this innovation is all happening in the context of ongoing investment in business strength. We continue to invest in distribution across the business. We added more than 60 hires into our sales function in the second quarter, surpassing 100 hires for the 1st half of the year, and the pipeline is accelerating. Active commercial pilot's increased 26% just since the end of April, we added 20 net new customers in the second quarter alone, our commercial customer count grew 32% in Q2 and we booked just over $900 million of total contract value in the second quarter, providing substantial visibility into our future growth. In our government business, we continue to see a broadening scope of opportunities and expansion of work that we're doing across defense, healthcare, and other critical initiatives. We signed new deals with the U.S. Army, Air Force, and Coast Guard, including a 2 year, $100 million deal with U.S. Special Operations Command. We participated in the U.S. Northern Command's third Global Information Dominance Experiment in July, where our software is driving applied AI decision-making for real-world scenarios, revolutionizing Northcom 's ability to wheel data to outpace adversaries. In healthcare, we signed new deals in the U.S. with HHS and the CDC. In July, we announced a doubling of our contract for the Tiberius platform, which the U.S. government uses to track vaccine production, distribution, and administration. These wins, reflect our expanding reach in both combating the pandemic and driving innovation across the healthcare landscape. Our working government continues to expand beyond defense in healthcare. In Q2, the FAA selected Palantir to provide the software backbone that will support aircraft certification and operational safety activities. The FAA will deploy Foundry to conduct critical tasks, including the ongoing monitoring of the 737 MAX fleet's return to service. This continues Palantir's thriving aerospace business with our deep partnership with Airbus and our work with airlines through Skywise. We continue to develop our channel partnerships as well. In June, we announced a new partnership with DataRobot focused on helping customers with demand forecasting. COVID disruptions have made a fool of all the old ways in managing these forecasts and created a huge amount of urgency to transform. By leveraging DataRobot model development, and Foundry's best-in-class software-defined data integration, ontology, and operational applications and workflows, brands can employ agile strategies for demand forecasting that can be deployed in minutes instead of months. We continue to build our relationships with Global SI. Our work with Accenture Federal has really taken off. We're working across agencies from intel, defense, and civilian. Accenture is investing in scaling this momentum across all of their markets units. As a cultural note, we were very excited to hold our annual Hack week last week back in our offices. Hack week has a storied and lively pounder tradition dating back to our earliest days. Hack week is so demonstrative of our culture of innovation, One that puts the very best people next to the problems that matter. The problems that define our time, and empowers each and every one of them to tell the man, who yes, is often me to F off. Some of our most innovative ideas and core technologies came out of pack weeks past, including the precursor to Apollo. and that's the interesting thing. The big ideas aren't always on the roadmap. That term of false comfort and polished lies that big tech companies provides us marchitecture note the big ideas, they come out of inspiration and perspiration. And I'm keenly aware as management that the very best ideas and the most profound ideas, they started as heresy as header DocSys (ph) that a hierarchical structure will snuff out. We at Palantir, we're an artist colony. Extraordinarily and exquisitely flat. And that is kept alive by organizing and reorganizing around our customer's problems, often with great volatility, not by gazing at our nables or calcified roadmaps. We do the hard thing and the brave thing because that's the right thing for our customers. I just want to celebrate The Hobbit, who crushed hack weeks present and past. Long live the Fellowship. Now, I'll turn it over to Dave to talk through the financials. Dave Glazer : Thanks, Shyam. I'll review our second-quarter performance followed by our outlook. We had a record-breaking Q2 as continued product innovation and our ongoing investments in distribution through a strong financial performance as deal activity accelerated in the second quarter. We generated year-over-year revenue growth of 49% for the quarter and for the first half bringing Q2 revenue to 376 million and first-half revenue to 717 million. We generated 50 million and adjusted free cash flow in the second quarter bringing our adjusted free cash flow for the first half of the year above 200 million, a free cash flow margin of 28% in the first half, which was a $433 million improvement year-over-year. We had a strong first half and have increased visibility for the second half of the year as reflected by our raise full-year adjusted free cash flow guidance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased to 117 million, representing a margin of 31%, our third straight quarter with adjusted operating margins above 30%. Second-quarter total contract value bookings grew a 175% year-over-year to 925 million, providing increased visibility for durable long-term growth, while second-quarter billings increased 40% year-over-year to 379 million. We added 20 net new customers in the quarter, 13% quarter-over-quarter sequential growth for our customer count. Our commercial customer count grew 32% quarter-over-quarter sequentially. Drilling down into our second-quarter revenue, revenue growth was 49% ahead of our prior guidance of 43%. We continue to see strength across our U.S. business, which grew 60% year-over-year in Q2. Looking at revenue by segment, second-quarter government revenue was 232 million of 66% year-over-year. The strength in our government business was driven by new deals with the U.S. Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, HHS, CDC, as well as milestone revenue for the international government customer. We continue to build a strong pipeline of opportunities within our government segment. And we expect these yields to drive sustained elevated growth in our government business moving forward. Second-quarter commercial revenue growth accelerated to 144 million up 28% year-over-year, compared with 19% growth in the first quarter. Speed and innovation are driving strong results in our commercial business. Particularly in the U.S. where commercial revenue growth accelerated to 90% year-over-year in Q2, up from 72% in Q1. We're also seeing growth in our international business as economies abroad continue to reopen. In the 2nd quarter, we closed 62 deals of a million or more in total contract value. We closed 30 deals of 5 million or more, including 21 deals that were 10 million or more. Total contract value booked in the second quarter grew a 175% year-over-year to 925 million. We ended the second quarter with total remaining deal value of 3.4 billion of 63% year-over-year. while commercial deal value was up 122% year-over-year to 2.1 billion. The average contract duration was 3.9 years, up from 3.7 years at the end of Q1. Second-quarter trailing 12-month revenue per customer was 7.9 million, up to 19% year-over-year, and down modestly from Q1. Result of rapid customer acquisition that yielded 20 net new customers in the quarter. As we noted on our first-quarter call, as a new customer additions accelerate, driven by growth in our Sales team and channel partners, and onboarding of new, innovative D-zero companies. We would expect average revenue per customer to be cheaper, reflecting our broadening customer base. When excluding the impact of new customers added in Q2, the average revenue per customer was 8.8 million, up 9% compared with Q1. The average trailing 12-month revenue for top-20 customers was 39 million, up 36% year-over-year Next I'll discuss margins and expenses on an adjusted basis, which excludes stock-based compensation. The second-quarter adjusted gross margin was 82% up 200 basis points versus the year-ago period. The contribution margin was 58%, up 300 basis points versus the year-ago period. Second-quarter income from operations excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes was 117 million, representing a margin of 31%. Adjusted expenses were 259 million, up 16% year-over-year, and reflects our ongoing scaling across the business, including both product development and sales to support durable long-term growth. We hired more than 100 sales people in the 1st half of the year, and expect hiring to continue at a strong clip in the 2nd half of 2021. Marketing spends nearly doubled in Q2 compared with Q1 as we continue to build up both brand and performance marketing to drive the sales and recruiting funnels. In the second quarter, we generated 50 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a margin of 13% and adjusted free cash flow that exceeded 200 million in the first half of 2021. Given our strong cash flow position, we repaid our outstanding $200 million term loan facility, and are currently debt-free. After paying off the debt, we ended the quarter with 2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. With our balance sheet and a strengthening cash flow profile, we plan to continue to invest in both product innovation and broadening distribution, as well as partnering with Day Zero companies to help them rapidly scale their businesses while leveraging our software platforms. In the first half of the year. We committed to invest 250 million and we funded approximately 20 million of those commitments today. We have and expect to continue to make additional strategic investments in the future. In the second quarter, 3 million or less than 1% of our quarterly revenue which from companies we invested in, as part of the strategic investment program we launched earlier this year. Turning to the outlook for our Q2 revenue guidance, we expect revenue of 385 million and we expect adjusted Operating margin of 22% for the quarter. On the back of our strong first-half adjusted free cash flow performance and continuing momentum in the second half of the year. We're raising full-year adjusted free cash flow guidance to an excess of 300 million. Continuing to execute the guidance strategy set forth by our CEO Alex Karp in our year-end 2020 earnings call with regard to long-term revenue guidance. We are providing and will continue to provide guidance of greater than 30% revenue growth for this year and the next four years at each earnings call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rodney to open Q&A. Rodney Nelson : Thanks Dave. We'll begin Q&A with questions submitted from our shareholders through say. Shyam first one is for you, Ralston asks, as Palantir deepened its relationships within the enterprise customer base to increase share of [Unclear]. How are these customers' lifecycles evolving over time as Palantir becomes their default operating system and how is it creating a flywheel of network effects? Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Ralston. It took about 8 years I'd say for Foundry to give the operating system of special operations, it took about 4 years to be the operating system of aviation. It took about 2 months to be the operating system COVID research and collaboration. And it's taking about 2 days to be the operating system of Day Zero companies and their ambitions to power their industry. Our vision remains unchanged. It's could be the default operating system for the enterprise and the industry. But customers, they're moving faster and faster, and the network affects are profound. Today, [unclear] 5% of the Boeing fleet is managed in Airbus's SkyWay ecosystem. That is a particularly powerful testament to the network effects. When you recall that Microsoft and Boeing launched a competitive ecosystem nearly a year before Foundry and Airbus launch SkyWay. And this further underscores the fundamental difference between that sort of LEGO block DIY approach versus our end-to-end operating system. Another example, one pharma Company has harmonized over 2,000 clinical trials in Foundry. For context, that pooled analysis of 5 clinical trials is often considered a big deal. 2,000 is a first; it's category-defining. And is their ambition to take that clinical trial asset to other pharma companies and collaborate on R&D. And if you believe that superior clinical insights will drive superior R&D outcomes, then the network effects here are going to be a game-changer. And if you're a pharma Company, and you are participating, where does that leave you? Probably at a fundamental and compounding disadvantage. To remain relevant, you need to join. This customer has innovated from using Foundry and operating system for their internal R&D to the operating system for the entire industry. And what's distinct for us about Day Zero companies is that their starting with that ambition from the beginning. The whole vision is to transform their industries. They are starting the ecosystem first. Rodney Nelson : Great, thanks, Shyam. Kevin, and the next one is for you. Avi asked, are you satisfied with the number of new customers added in the last quarter? Kevin Kawasaki : Thanks, Avi The numbers are strong. Customer count is accelerating, especially if you look at the commercial space where we grew our customer count 32% quarter-over-quarter and up 61% for the first half of the year. So on track to more than double our commercial customer base by end of year. Deal volume was also up. We closed 62 deals of 1 million or more. That is a 72% increase from last quarter. Second-quarter, TCB grew a 175% to 925 million year-over-year. Our current customers also grew. If you net out new customers to average revenue, per customer grew from 8.1 million to 8.8 million quarter-over-quarter. Our largest customers, top 20, also grew from 36 million to 39 million. These results are driven by investments in our product and efficiencies in distribution. So I'll finish by reiterating what Shyam just discussed. We are now delivering a full power Foundry to small companies through a subscription model. And we're doing this across many sectors, range from healthcare to robotics, to software companies, SaaS businesses using Foundry to build their offerings. Rodney Nelson : Great Kevin, sticking with you on the next one, [Unclear] asks, can you guys describe your long-term vision with your pipe investments into pre-revenue companies? The talk is Palantir 's buying revenue, but I believe it is a clever, high-risk, high-reward strategy enhancing network effects. Kevin Kawasaki : Thank you. This is a huge opportunity for us to invest in our customers, and that's something we feel we've always done. Now, we can do with our balance sheet. These are companies that we think we will be working with for very long time. Further, we think that using our product is going to help them win. One thing we've always looked for in our customer relationships is the founder mentality. That is where we're most aligned. No bureaucracy, high-speed, quality execution. So that's something that we're looking for in these deals, that founder mentality. So I'll also break down the numbers a little bit here. Dave already mentioned that less than 1% of our revenue came from this program in Q2. Additionally, of the 925 million of total TCB in Q2, 543 million from this program. This is a long-term strategy. And the deal is as long-term as well, so we expect longer duration and time to revenue recognition. The portion of the Q2 TCB outside of the strategic investments is also strong, totaling 382 million. This grew at a sequential rate of 33%, quarter-over-quarter. So in other words, assumed no investment program, TCB grows 33% sequentially from last quarter. So very pleased with that. And we signed a lot of great institutions [unclear] National Grid, Avi, John Deere, Bass Pro, [unclear], the FAA, we expanded with U.S. Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, CDC, HHS, Tiberius, which as you probably know by now, U.S. government used to tract vaccine production, distribution, and administration. And last but not least, we did $100 million expansion with U.S. Special Forces. Rodney Nelson : Great, thanks, Kevin. Dave, coming to you at the next one. Linda asks, when does Palantir expect to report positive GAAP, EPS? Dave Glazer : Thanks, Linda. We're delivering high growth with strong cash flow results, and very few institutions can do that at our scale. June numbers, we focus on a lot. Revenue and our ability to generate cash from that revenue, which is measured by the adjusted free cash flow. In the first half of this year, we did 49% revenue growth, with a 28% adjusted free cash flow margin. And we raised our full-year adjusted free cash flow outlook by 100% to an excess of 300 million from our prior guidance of 150 million. Rodney Nelson : Great. Thank,. Dave. Shyam, coming back to you, Mohamad asks, how fast is the business growing? And what are some possible competitive threats to Palantir? Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Mohamad. So for the 1st half, we grew revenue 49%, we generated 28% adjusted free cash flow margin, and a 33% adjusted operating income. Our commercial customer count grew 32% sequentially, it's up 61% since the beginning of the year. Our U.S. commercial revenue grew 90% year-over-year. The international commercial revenue is accelerating. Our healthcare work is growing. And what you see with all of these things is our growth is only constrained by the envision of our customers. And on the frontlines of COVID, there is no lack of ambition around the vaccination programs or for a clinical R&D project, or the transformation of the commercial supply chain. And what you -- and you see that most clearly with Day Zero companies. These Day Zero companies, they want to accomplish in less than 5 months with the PTS and the Airbus's is sought to do with Foundry over 5 years. And that's the thing I'm most excited about in terms of working with them. These companies are tackling enormous problems on aggressive timelines, and they are planning to all of that on top of Foundry. And so you should talk to them and see what they think about the competitive threats and what their alternatives were. But my distinct impression is that they either build on top of Foundry or they spend a lot more time and a lot more money building something bespoke from scratch on the rep. And I think that's pretty easy decision in their shoes. So simply put the competitive threat is it's cowardice and laziness. And where the customers brave and efficient, we win every time. Rodney Nelson : Great, Shyam, another one for you Jason asks, it seems the nominee analysts understand what Palantir does. Are there plans for the Company to increase its PR presence, to increase awareness of its business model, which may lead to increase utilization of Palantir 's various software platforms? Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Jason, I can't really tell you why some people don't know or understand what we do. I can tell you about the people who do not know though. It's the special operators, who chase down Karp to give him up. It's the civil servant who work tirelessly to deliver vaccines in the U.S. and the U.K. it's the French government, as they raise for rents -- are from excluding on the eve of Micron's election. The Germans beliefs to cost the suicide bombers and time to supply chain operators at the World Food Program tackling COVID, escalating impact on global poverty and hunger, the factory workers on the assembly lines from [unclear] to Detroit decided besides it's and clinical R&D among COVID, the hostages in Nigeria who we're rescued, we seem to be clear and crisp by communicating with these folks, with users at the extreme edge, and perhaps be able to talk to them. Rodney Nelson : Great. Thanks, Shyam. Dave, one for you. Benjamin asks, why has there been a significant increase of insider selling recently? Dave Glazer : Thanks, Benjamin. You're referring to the scheduled sales you seen from Harbors a few times a month, each month that started earlier this year. As I mentioned on the call last quarter in Q1, Harbors granted a large number of options 10 years ago that expired in December at the end of this year. In short, if he doesn't exercise the options before then, he will lose all the shares. So far in 2021, Harbors exercised roughly 40 million of those options, selling half the shares, and using the funds to exercise and hold the remaining half. So group as a perspective, [Indiscernible] hundreds of millions of dollars income taxes this year as part of these transactions, and will likely owe a couple 100 million more by the end of the year. For the roughly 27 million options that are set to expire at end of December, he's scheduled to sell half of them, and use upon [Indiscernible] exercise and hold the other half. Rodney Nelson : Great, thanks, Dave. Shyam coming back to you, Ralston asks, as Karp once said, [Indiscernible] years numbers are lagging indicator of several macro trends at management GAAP rate. What forward-looking micro and macro trends give management confidence that can be leveraged to improving shareholders' value or delivering alpha over time? Shyam Sankar : Thanks Austin. If I told an analysts or a Wall Street investor 4 months ago, that COVID was not going away, I will have been laughed at. I happen to know this because I did tell them this, and I was laughed at over and over again. Look, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. The world has changed and it isn't going back. We built software for the world we are in now and the world we will continue to be in. We saw that coming. We anticipated the future needs, supply chain will never be the same, but isn't just about today's shortages. The old world, it's fixated on the accuracy of the forecast. The new world is all about how well you manage the error in your forecast. Error is the signal, the error is the opportunity to win. Healthcare is never going to be the same. Its not just about the vaccine, is going to be about working through the 18-month backlog and the impact on morbidity and mortality from delayed in deferred diagnosis. Energy [Indiscernible] every industry has been transformed. Our customers, they were disappointed and frankly angry by how few of their IT investments over the last decade, rose needed [Indiscernible]. It was a huge market, it was ugly. The reality is that shock will be more frequent. It's isn't a one-off. It's the new norm. Years of investing my mindless inefficiency has resulted in enormous fragility. We are the resilient operating system for the future champion. Rodney Nelson : Great Shyam. One more for you before we open it up. Steve asks, how will Palantir continue to attract and keep great talent? Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Steve. Well, this is a question that's near and dear to my heart. I mean, we have such a unique culture and I think -- I can't really tell you about culture. Management can explain our culture. It's something it has to be experienced. It emanates from every core of the institution. And that culture is fueled by our mission. We have slept on concrete floors in Baghdad. We have been on the front lines of fighting HIV, TB, malaria, and Ebola in Africa. We have coded from the factory floors, from Toulouse to Detroit. I can't describe the culture, but I can tell you the fundamental tenants that the culture is symptomatic of. We are an artist calling; we're not a factory. People don't come to Palantir. Don't come to Palantir if you want a predictable career trajectory or some methodical ladder to climb. We don't have that. Some companies are factories. You start up as Software Engineer 1, and if you work your way up, you can be Software Engineer 1 1/2, or something like that. We're an artist calling. It makes no sense to tell Dal Li to paint more like Monet. We are looking for unique and extraordinary people who by definition are going to be uneven and spiky. And we're committed to going on a journey with that, to build a bespoke roll around who they are as humans. We spend so much time thinking critically about our people. Who are they? Who can they be? How do we maximize them and their potential? We spend time thinking about exactly what gamma radiation, your incoming Bruce Banner needs to turn into the Incredible Hulk, and then we eradiate them. Working at Palantir isn't for everyone. But if it is for you, the fellowship is charismatic beyond compare. And you don't get this culture for free. The entropy of the universe is against you. You have to wake up every day and fight for it. Rodney Nelson : Great thanks Shyam Operator, we'll open up the call for Q& A Operator : [Operator Instruction] And your first question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Good morning, thanks for the caller. The commercial business was impressive quarter-on-quarter. I'm curious if you could just drill in and talk to a little more of the drivers from direct sales build-outs, the IBM partnership to bringing Palantir to everyone. Can you maybe just give us a little more color in terms of what's driving this? And how do you think about the shape of this for the back half of the year? Thank you. Shyam Sankar : Absolutely. Thanks, Brent. I'll start there. You're seeing the effects of our investment in the direct sales force area. We are really happy about the 100 or so folks we hired in the first half of the year here. They're ramping well. We're getting a lot more account coverage here. Some really big logos in the quarter, FD Edison, National Grid, Avis, Deer. And not just, of course, exceptional strength in the commercial sector, but also, we're seeing that in the government sector as well with new wins like with the FAA. And so, we should expect to see more year -- Of course, channel's contributing. We're really happy about that as they're about 10% of the ad gain from the channel. But really, the impact of the direct sales force is starting to take hold here. Operator : Your next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe. Alex Zukin : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess Shyam maybe just first, can you talk about revisiting the question around the percentage of TCB that's coming from the strategic partnerships. How do you expect that to evolve? What are the duration of some of these contracts? That was a pretty striking metric that it was 50% of your TCB was from these strategic partnerships. So just want to get a better understanding of what the overall strategy is for the Company there? Shyam Sankar : Yep. Sure. So we broke down the numbers a little bit here, and Dave mentioned less than 1% of the revenue came this program in Q2. Additionally, I have the 925 million total TCB in Q2, 543 from the program. Is your questions of long-term strategy the deals are very long-term as well. So we expect some longer duration and time to revenue recognition. Talked about this a little bit, but just to reiterate, the portion of TCB outside of the strategic investments is also very strong, totaling 382 million. This grew on a sequential rate of 33%, quarter-over-quarter. In other words, without the investment program, GP (ph) gross 33% sequentially. And then I think there is a little bit more on the long-term vision here. Dr. Karp has discussed how we're building software for the future in the press and Foundry, the operating system for the modern enterprise. And we're bringing Foundry to people who have the ambition to transform industries and create a new one. We've talked about this, but we're looking at companies in cell-based therapeutics, file and medical healthcare delivery, quantum computing, satellite, electric vehicles, delivering worldwide intelligence from space. Shyam Sankar : And a lot more. These are companies that have cutting-edge technology of their own. And they're choosing Foundry to help drive their vision forward. And we think many will follow. And our strategic investment program accelerates this. Operator : Your next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Thank you, guys, for taking the question. Maybe two questions, one following on Alex's. When we think about the 20 new commercial customers, can you give us a sense of how many of those came from the strategic partnership program? And then, second question, more product related. I know you guys have been doing a lot of work to increase the modularity of the overall platform. Can you talk to us about how that's been progressing and how customers have been adopting that? Has that been part of what's accelerating new customer adoption? Shyam Sankar : Absolutely. Thanks, Keith. It's a 7 of the 20, I believe came from the strategic investment program. And on the product that I -- we absolutely are continuing to invest in the modularity there. Very excited about that. I discussed some of the evolution of Edge AI. We shared some of the videos earlier on, hope we can to see that. But more broadly, everything from [Indiscernable] date integration,the expansion number systems we're integrating with, accelerating with the archetypes that I talked about the example with the EU Bank, and being able to deploy production, anti-money laundering workflows, compliance workflows in 2 days, which would have taken us 3 months, 3 years ago. And I think the alternatives are the year in the making there. So enabling a bank to buy just the AML answer, instead of say all of the foundries have absolutely spent our time-to-market and is helping us accelerate our customer growth. Operator : Your last question comes from Mark Cash with Morningstar. Mark Cash : Thanks for taking the question. When thinking about the guidance with last 3 quarters of over 30% operating margin, artificially high, and then could you provide some details on the operating margin guidance for the third quarter, but in particular line items are expected to ramp up. And as the low-to-mid 20% range that we should expect as you ramp for Growth in the next coming years? Dave Glazer : Thanks, Mark. And thanks for pointing out last three-quarters of 30%. And this quarter, you're strategic. Last three quarters's about 30%. This quarter, above 33%. And I think we're doing that while we are investing in the business. And so, if you look at the 1st half of this year, we added 100 salespeople. Shyam talked about how we're going to really keep that pace up going into the back of the year. We're building lot of structure around them, building out the operations there, well speak on marketing spend, really almost doubled in the Q2 coming off in Q1. We're going to continue to do that throughout the year here and anything beyond. We're going to continue to hire aggressively into product development into other cross business. And so, as we think about the year, we see about continuing to invest, and we're really excited about the next time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Rodney Nelson : Good morning. Welcome to Palantir's Third Quarter 2021 earnings call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued prior to the market open and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that maybe be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects, and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed prior to market open today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation, and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palentir.com. Joining me on today's call are Shyam Sankar, Chief Operating Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Kevin Kawasaki, Global Head of Business Development. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. I will turn the call over to Shyam to get us started. Shyam Sankar : Thank you, Rodney. It was a fantastic quarter across the board. In Q3, total revenue grew 36%. Commercial revenue growth has accelerated in every quarter over the last year, from 4% in Q4 2020 to 19% in Q1 to 28% in Q2. Now, 37% in Q3. At this scale, acceleration like this, it's gravity defying. U.S. commercial revenue growth accelerated once again to 103% year-over-year. We added 34 net new customers in Q3. To put this in perspective, our commercial customer count grew by 46%, sequentially. We have more than doubled our commercial customer count since the beginning of the year. We closed 54 deals of $1 million or more, 33 of which were $5 million or more, and 18 of which were $10 million or more. Adjusted free cash flow was a $119 million a margin of 30%. Total deal value grew 50% to $3.6 billion. Commercial deal value more than doubled to $2.2 billion. Remaining performance obligations increased by 172%, and year-to-date we have grown revenue 44% to over $1.1 billion. We have generated adjusted free cash flow margin of 29% and 32% adjusted operating margin. There are so many wins this quarter. Instead of going through them customer by customers as I usually do, I wanted to highlight 3 themes. (1) We are seeing more traction selling into the defense industrial base as a customer. Foundry has shown that it can help in the production of the A-320 of Ram pickup trucks, auto parts, PPE and tractors. It can do it better, faster and cheaper. And the defense industrial base is seeing that it can have the same impact on the production of fighter jets, naval ships, and land vehicles. We are excited to do more here with L3Harris, Huntington Ingalls, and other large primes.  Secondly, our work in automotive, and more generally, mobility is growing. We are adding more customers across the mobility value chain, from OEMs and their suppliers all the way to EV charging companies and insurers. And lastly, our work in healthcare is exploding. The NHS, MD Anderson, 70 academic medical centers through the NIH\u2019s N3C, the Department of Veteran Affairs, and even more regional U.S. providers means that Foundry is helping to manage over 300 million patient lives and growing. We have a very unique opportunity and a diverse footprint that we believe continues to uniquely position us deliver on the necessary transformation in healthcare delivery from operational excellence to complex clinical care. Cutting-edge product and continued innovation and distribution drove these exceptional results in Q3. And you can really see that in the consistently accelerating commercial business. We are seeing a profound pull on foundry in the market as organizations digest and synthesize lessons from the shocks of COVID and subsequent events, there is a canonical spot for foundry in the enterprise architecture that the market has synthesized. Foundry is the nervous system and the cardiovascular system of the enterprise. It is the connective tissue that connect your analytics to your operational systems. Such an architecture marries a digital twin of the enterprise with action APIs that allow you to first model and simulate and second orchestrate and execute complex, cross-functional transactions. As the COVID-19 crisis pulled the tide out, that's exactly what was revealed as missing. Companies needed to move beyond visibility, beyond analytical insights to having the technical infrastructure to translate that into coordinated, orchestrated actions in the operations of their business. And one of the coolest places to see this working is with our day zero companies. These companies have enormous ambition and deeply value the step change in speed and the reduction of expenses foundry delivers when consumed as infrastructure as a service. Wejo was able to develop market ready applications in as little as 6 weeks on Foundry; Sarcos is integrating 0.5 trillion data points per month to accelerate design, maintenance and commercialization of their iron man suits. Lilium is flying through ground and flight testing using the vast data generated by every sensor streaming from the aircraft. I'd like to introduce some of our Day Zero founders to unpack this a little bit more. [Video Presentation Starts] These companies have a strong engineering culture and they've been able to very quickly take on the platform and make it a core part of their tech infrastructure.  I'm a third generation manufacturer. I grew up in Detroit. And from my earliest days was inspired by the importance of manufacturing as an industry. [Indiscernible] we believe the impact of [cloud] (ph) manufacturing will be as profound on the physical world as cloud computing has been in the digital world.  Wejo is [Indiscernible] leading the mobility revolution. We\u2019re unlocking the value of connected vehicle data and autonomous vehicle data. Palantir Foundry super charges our distribution to thousands and thousands of new supplies in new solutions in industry. Foundry unlocks the business potential volume. We found ourselves constantly trying to twist our business to fit inside someone else's perspective of how businesses work. And that didn't work.  They've been using Foundry as their data operating system. So end to end from cloud hosting to data integration from different data sources through using a lot of the out-of-the-box connectors that we have in the platform. From there, harmonizing the data using open source languages like Python, SQL, using Spark as their distributed compute engine. We're collecting data on every part that we make today. Data about the design, data about how that part is made in our factories, data about how when that part is moved ultimately to our customers.  Speed is our superpower, speed to me means real-time processing of over 17 billion data points today, that we processed in real time over 12 trillion data points. Our business is premised upon high-quality data, and the understanding of that data on the part of people.  Once they have this data [Indiscernible] they\u2019ve been just building a number of operational applications, mostly for their internal operations to help like supercharge that, but also for even kind of external third-party users as part of their -- tech offering.  Foundry enables us to build solutions fast and develop unique intelligence for industry. For Wejo a partnership with Palantir was the obvious choice.  If you're not using Foundry, you better think about what your position in the Company is because everybody will be using Foundry. [Video Presentation Ends] A big thanks to our builders who shared more about their ambition and the transformative impact of Foundry on their operations. We started this program to supercharge earlier stage companies, enabling them to create a central operating system for their data and to scale rapidly from day 0. These companies, they're not just managing their data and their operations, they are wielding that to breach scale and win. We announced our second cohort of Builders in October. There are 7 companies from a diverse set of industries, and we continue to partner with innovative companies across industries such as automotive, biotech, healthcare, media, and more. Turning more broadly to the commercial business, the scope of our impact is expanding. Foundry 's infrastructure is a big theme we're excited about. Customers are building their software on top of our platform. And now we have yet another way to power that with a major product innovation that extends the openness and flexibility of our infrastructure for developers that we're calling Operational APIs or OPIs for short. This liberates the ontology to serve as the nervous system, the cardiovascular system of the enterprise, as a unified action in orchestration layer. This API toolset allows for third parties and customer developers to programmatically interact with Foundry 's ontology. In this headless mode, ID can leverage the power of the ontology in all of their enterprise applications via this open architecture. What's uniquely powerful about the ontology, it's not denounced. It's not the things in the business. It's the representation of the verbs, the actions that could be taken to those things in the business. The fact that inventory can be allocated, production can be scheduled, orders can be fulfilled. To accomplish these deceptively simple actions requires you to read and write to potentially tens of source systems transactionally. Foundry lets you orchestrate complex cross-system decisions to win and turn market disruption in to your competitive glory. For example, a large industry partner is unlocking value by integrating Microsoft Power Apps with the Foundry ontology. Power Apps through our OPIs can affect business decisions, powering workflows, and writing data back to external, operational, and transactional systems like ERP, MES, Warehouse Management Systems, and more. This is a modern operating system and action. We launched Apollo this past week as a commercial offerings enabling any software Company to leverage our deployment infrastructure to take their SaaS where no SaaS has gone before, on press, classified clouds, air gap networks and to the Edge. Here to tell us more is Greg [Indiscernible], the mad scientist behind the conception and launch of Apollo. [Video Presentation Starts] Apollo is an orchestration engine for the enterprise, enabling continuous deployment, configuration management, and central software operations across many cloud and on - prem environment. Apollo employees, a number of different concurrent processes, including version management, advanced rollout strategies, and release promotion to ensure platforms stay up-to-date and operational 24/7. With Apollo, you can release new capabilities, deploy the mid scale, compose them into novel platforms, de -risk releases, and rapidly resolve problems as they arise. Having deployment, health, and continuity on a single panning glass, these engineers common interface to handle risk management concerns, unique teach environment. Different environments have different risk tolerances when it comes to software updates. For instance, once for all new features to canary environments first before moving those same updates to classified networks are critical edge hardware that are harder to operate. Apollo facilitates software stability across these different environments by using a concept called release channels. Environments can subscribe to release channel in accordance with our individual risk tolerance and appetite for new features. Once pushed via release channel, Apollo enables the evaluation roll-outs through a powerful suite of tools to help operators understand the risks associated with each pipeline, surface problems in ship code better. Apollo makes it possible to take the same approach to continuous delivery across different security classification boundaries by enabling you to deploy an Apollo hub within each network boundary. Each network hub is responsible for managing the environments on that network. This compliance aware changed management enables Apollo to essentially managed services in environments across different compliance regime, powering seamless operations across highly regulated business environments. Apollo effectively removes the deployment environment as constrained, enabling engineers to focus on velocity and application code. The rate code one that works for all customer requirements. [Video Presentation Ends] And we continue to push the envelope of Apollo capability by enabling Streaming Processing at the Edge. Once again, we are building 5 years ahead of the market. A software is building technology that will meet its moment. With our latest investments, we'll be able to develop streaming pipelines in Foundry that you then package up, version, and continuously deploy to Edge's compute Infrastructure be it a Humby, a satellite, a 5G base stations to enable real-time processing of large amounts of data in a decentralized, efficient manner. These pipelines, there'll be version upgrade, managing, orchestrated by Apollo. Imagine, you'll be able to Bluegreen upgrade your streaming pipeline across submarines, factory floors, 5G and 6G networks. This is a revolutionary capability that will give our customers the Edge against their competition. There are 2 modular offerings that we've taken the market that we were really quite excited about, carbon and emissions management and AML for Crypto and Cintex. Starting with carbon emissions management, there's a huge need to not simply account for carbon, and more broadly, emissions, but what are you going to do about it? Day-to-day, month-to-month, how do you manage trade-offs between production on time and full revenue, margin, and emissions targets? How do you understand the levers you have to pull and the implications of each levers? Do you have the ability to understand the consequences of changing a supplier or setting a different delivery routing or changing a production location on your emissions? Can you put that information into a single pane of glass? The same pane that your Company uses to manage production or revenue or margin. Because until you do, emissions management will only be a source of beta for you, something that you do so that you're not left behind. But once you do, you'll be able to use it to beat your competition and win in the market. These workflows are tailor made for Foundry and leverage our digital twin in supply chain capabilities to present a single pane of glass to view revenue, margin, production, and all emissions to not just see, but to manage the outcome. This is an area that we are seeing growing momentum in no small part because of the obvious charisma of alpha of developing a competitive edge. Customers across disparate industries are building carbon focused common operating pictures to track live emissions, to simulate emissions impacts of the changes to, for example, suppliers to technologies, and regulations, and to make a real-time changes to their business. The other offerings we're really excited about is Foundry for crypto. We have found a unique fit with fast-growing crypto companies that need industrialized compliance solutions. We are leveraging our deep anti-money laundering and know-your-customer expertise developed over years helping governments find compliance issues with the world largest banks, and helping those banks respond and harden their compliance programs. I mentioned last quarter how one of Europe's largest retail banks has deployed our AML solution in two days. Two days, the cost, speed, and performance is unmatchable. These crypto exchanges in FinTech disruptors are actually technical and can easily discern what legacy bank struggled to. That legacy compliance solutions are often 2 or more decades behind. We believe there are no alternatives that can compete on cost, speed, and performance. And we're really excited to put more weight behind this in the market. Turning to government, we continue to advance our mission of becoming the U.S. government's central operating system as we extend our footprint across defense, healthcare, and civilian agencies. In the third quarter, we signed new deals with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Air Force, the NIH, and more. I'm proud to say that the MetaConstellation, which we featured in last quarter's earnings call met its moment when called upon by UK MOD to enable Noncombatant Evacuation Operations in Afghanistan. As a reminder, the MetaConstellation is radically changing how satellites are test, the latency of collection and it's creating a fundamental link in the AI enabled kill chain. We are orchestrating a Meta-constellation of more than 300 satellites by working with an array of commercial space companies. These companies have been deploying constellations of hyperspectral radar and Elan sensors into orbit. And we're putting all that power directly into the hands to the frontlines empowering the Edge. End-to-end Gotham and Foundry infrastructure, including Meta-constellation provided unparalleled capability and was stood up in less than a day for UK MOD operations. In addition, Meta-constellation was also used to great effect at last month's [Indiscernible] U.S. military exercises were provided timely and effective targeting information. This is all made possible because of Apollo for Edge AI. We were recently down selected by the U.S. Army to be the sole provider of the army's intelligence data fabric and analytics foundation for the capability drop Capability Drop 2 program. The army will deploy Gotham to support intelligence workflows worldwide with a globally federated intelligence data fabric and analytics platform, spanning multiple security classifications. Our work on CD2 is just one of many initiatives, of which we are engaging with the army, including CD1 and TITAN that will accelerate the decision chain and provide decisive advantage for our armed forces in the near-peer fight. We have a motivating set of customers and growing pipeline for big pursuits in '22 and beyond, and it is growing every quarter. We're not just competing for programs. Our unique capabilities are creating their own opportunities. Our work in healthcare continues to expand, and we recently signed a 4-year $87 million contract with the Department of Veteran Affairs. This department serves 9 million veterans and their family members and spends nearly $0.25 trillion per year. After supporting them in the exigency during COVID-19 response, we won an unrestricted competition to help power their data transformation efforts. Our software is going to enable the VA to integrate data across its large IT landscape and ultimately to deliver better care and services for our veterans. It is a privilege to serve our veterans and war fighters, both on the battlefield and in their period after service. Our collaboration with the NIH continues in the fight against COVID-19. As N3C deepens its partnership with Palantir, leveraging Foundry as their research backbone. This 2-year award carries a total potential value of $60 million and the N3C data enclave represents one of the largest collections of COVID-19 health records in the world. Additionally, our work with NCATS expanded with an increase in total potential value of $24 million. Zooming out a bit, from an emerging space, a big picture in the government segment, we're seeing an emerging opportunity to help define the next wave of disruption. One thing -- perhaps the one thing we have demonstrated to the market is that it is possible to sell software at scale to the government for programs of record where the government might have historically otherwise bought labor and services. And of course in doing so, we have radically transformed the margin profile of these big government contracts. There is an immense opportunity in this sector to partner with existing government contractors to productize their solutions that they are delivering as services today and in doing so, to transform the EBITDA they generate against their existing revenue with our platforms. We have proven we can do this with our business, and we are exploring opportunities to partner with firms that have a disruptive vision and realize that they can stand on our shoulders the 15 years and nearly $3 billion of R&D that we have done to productize and scale their own offerings. Before turning it over to Dave, I wanted to give a quick shout out to every Hobbit and just reflect on our journey as much over the last 2 decades as over the last year. A year ago, we gave our first result as a public Company. We should be proud of those 5 quarters of results, but even prouder of the collective effort and passion that begot those results. We pivoted the whole Company to respond to the exigent events of COVID for governments and commercial entities around the world, but of course, that happened before we went public, and we all had that question. Will we preserve the cultural essence of Palantir after the listing? Will we have the radical ability to organize and reorganize around the problem at hand while capturing the integral of our innovation. While in Q3, we could answer that question definitively. Yes. When the bat signal was put up in the night sky, the Motley [Indiscernible] habits answered the call for America and her allies, 5 quarters down, at least 500 more to go. Over to you, Dave. Dave Glazer : Thanks, Shyam. I'll review our third quarter performance followed by our outlook. We had a record-breaking Q3 as continued product innovation and our ongoing investments in distribution led to accelerating customer account growth and strong free cash flow. We generated revenue growth of 36% in the quarter, bringing Q3 revenue to $392 million and year-to-date revenue to more than $1.1 billion, up 44% versus the first 9 months of last year. Our business continues to demonstrate very strong cash-generation. Third quarter cash [Indiscernible] operations was a $101 million, an improvement of a $153 million versus the prior year period. We delivered a $119 million in adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter, representing a margin of 30%. The strength of our third quarter performance brings year-to-date adjusted free cash flow to $320 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 29% and $605 million improvement from the prior-year period. Third quarter adjusted operating income increased to a $116 million representing a margin of 30% or a fourth consecutive quarter with adjusted operating margin of 30% -- and a total customer count grew 20% quarter-over-quarter. Our commercial customer count increased 46% quarter-over-quarter, and it is more than doubled since -- 66% to $38 million, and these customers are already generating contribution margin of 36%. This compares with just $23 million in revenue and a -26% contribution margin for new customers over the comparable period in 2020. Drilling down into our third quarter revenue, total revenue grew 36% year-over-year ahead of our prior guidance of 33%. Our U.S. business continues to demonstrate strong growth with revenue increasing 45% year-over-year in Q3. I need you to see broad-based momentum in our commercial business. Total commercial and representing our third straight quarter of accelerating commercial revenue growth. Our investments in product and distribution continued to drive growth, particularly in the U.S. where commercial revenue increased 103% in Q3. And our international business continue to gain momentum as well with international commercial revenue growth accelerating for the third straight quarter as economies continue to reopen and recover. Government revenue increased 34% as we signed new deals with the Air Force, HHS, and NIH. And we were recently down-selected by the U.S. Army to provide its intelligence data fabric and analytics solution under CD-2. In the third quarter, we closed 54 deals of a $1 million or more in total contract value, including 33 deals of $5 million or more and 18 deals of $10 million and more. Third quarter billings increased -- 172% year-over-year. As you continue to improve contracting, push out, or remove termination for convenience causes and move to shorter duration billing cycles. Total remaining deal value increased 50% year-over-year to $3.6 billion with commercial remaining deal value increasing 101%. Third quarter trailing 12-months revenue per customer was $7 million, down sequentially and reflecting continued acceleration in customer acquisition as we added 34 net new customers in the quarter. We continue to expect rapid expansion in our customer base moving forward, as we invest in our sales teams and channel partners and we would expect average revenue per customer to continue to taper as a result of our growing customer count. When excluding new customers added in the quarter, average revenue per customer was $8.8 million, up 26% year-over-year, and we continue to generate strong growth with our largest customers. Trailing 12-month revenue per top 20 customers was $41.3 million, up 35% year-over-year. Next, I'll discuss our third quarter margins and expenses on an adjusted basis, which excludes stock-based compensation. Adjusted gross margin was 82%, up from 81% in the year-ago period. Contribution margin was 57%, up from 56% in the year-ago period. Third quarter income from operations excluding stock based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, was $116 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 30% our fourth consecutive quarter with adjusted operating margin at or above 30%. Third-quarter adjusted expenses, the bulk of expense growth is driven by continued investments in product development in sales to support, durable, long-term growth. Marketing expenses were up a 144% quarter-over-quarter as we continue to fuel demand generation. In the third quarter we generated a $119 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a margin of 30%. Through the first 9 months of 2021, adjusted free cash flow was $320 million, representing an improvement of $605 million versus the prior year period. We ended the third quarter with over $2.3 billion in cash and no debt. Turning to our outlook. For a Q4 revenue guidance, we expect revenue of $418 million and we expect adjusted operating margin of 22%. Our Q4 revenue guidance implies full-year 2021 revenue of $1.527 billion, which represents another year of revenue growth of 40% or higher. Additionally, for the full-year 2021, we are raising our annual adjusted free cash flow guidance to an excess of $400 million, an increase of $100 million from our prior guidance. Continuing to execute the guidance strategy set forth by our CEO, Alex Karp, in our year-end 2020 earnings call with regard to long-term revenue guidance, we are providing and will continue to provide guidance of 30% or greater revenue growth for this year, and the next 4 years at each earnings call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rodney to open up Q&A. Rodney Nelson : Thanks, Dave. We will begin with questions from our shareholders submitted today. Shyam, this first one's for you. Jason B and Jacob P both asked, does Palantir view any other AI companies as competitors? If so, what makes Palantir platforms a better choice? Shyam Sankar : Thank you, Jason. Thank you, Jacob. Our competition is not any other Company. It's really -- the competition is our customer, specifically, our customer's IT department and their desire to build their own solution. And you know what? It's not even really their fault. There's an army of consultants and comp providers who pedal completely bogus DIY market textures that are never going to work. It took us 15 years and nearly $3 billion of development and we continue to innovate every day. Just last week, we had a meeting with the Fortune 200 CIO, who was so excited to see Foundry because he has spent the last 3 years trying unsuccessfully to solve the same problems with a leading cloud provider; 3 years. And they aren't the only ones. These are our favorite conversations because having tried and failed, the customer knows exactly how valuable it is to buy a solution that works in days at scale. But that's not really what makes us a better choice. We're a better choice, because we focus exclusively on alpha. We express their strategy. Whereas most enterprise software makes the customer more similar to the competition our products, they are designed to make them more different, more differentiated. Rodney Nelson : Great Shyam, another one for you, Alex, [Indiscernible] and Jeff asked, are you planning to invest in any cryptocurrency? Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Alex and Jeff. We are super excited about Foundry for crypto. We thinking -- we see a unique fit with fast-growing crypto companies that need industrialized compliance solutions. These are highly technical buyers and they're highly motivated disruptors. We are leveraging our deep anti-money laundering and know your customer expertise, expertise that we developed over years, helping government sign [Indiscernible] and helping those banks in turn were [Indiscernible] just decide and at the banks themselves, we think we're going to be a massive accelerate for crypto companies. We're going to give them credible AML platforms to enable them to go toe-to-toe and beyond with the legacy players. We're going to deliver. Rodney Nelson : Do you intend to focus on profitability in the near-term or are you still focused on expansion? Dave Glazer : Thanks, Rodney. As you see in our results, we're delivering strong growth with strong cash flow. We expect revenue growth of 40% for the full year. Expecting our second year in a row of 40% or higher revenue growth. We've raised our adjusted free cash flow guide to an excess of $400 million for the year to second straight quarter rate in our guidance. And it implies an over $670 million year-over-year improvement. Stepping back, we are continuing to deliver high-growth with very strong cash flow results and we remain focused on expansion. And so pivoting to expansion, we have more pilots today than at any time in our history. We added 34 net new customers in Q3. We signed 54 deals -- [Indiscernible ] with Apollo. We've added 150 sales heads this year, not to mention building the infrastructure to support them and future hires, and we're continuing to build out and invest in marketing. Still in its early days, but our marketing spend is up 144% quarter-over-quarter. Rodney Nelson : Thanks, Dave. Shyam, another one for you, [Daniel] (ph ) asks, Gotham and Foundry can be used on personal computers, tablets, and smartphones, can Palantir's platforms be used on augmented reality and virtual reality devices? How impactful will AR, VR, and the metaverse will be for Palantir, its clients, and big data analytics? Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Daniel. We have been doing augmented in virtual reality for a long time, more than a decade. We have worked on pushing mission information to smartphones in augmented reality. So you can hold up your phone and view mission plans, route, HLZ helicopter landing zones, points of interest, way points overlaid while you're on mission. We have worked on augmenting imagery and full-motion video with AI detection in mission context real-time to drive operational decision-making. At a recent military exercise, our Apollo for Edge AI capability was used across air-launched effect and unmanned aerial vehicles to send targets to fighter jet. Those targets popped up in the pilot's augmented reality heads-up display. We are at the Edge. We are integrating with Edge devices from night vision goggles, to heads-up displays from augmented reality and cockpit's training simulations. AI enabling the kill chain requires pushing context to the decision-making Edge. So we see AI and VR as integral part of everything that we do. Rodney Nelson : Great. Thanks Shyam. Kevin, one for you. Justin R, Jackson K, and others have asked, can you talk about the opportunity for Palantir and small businesses and consumer use down the line? Kevin Kawasaki : Thank you, Justin. Thank you, Jackson. Our SMB offering delivers the full power of Foundry through Apollo and to be adopted in days. And we see this with Foundry for Builders and other Day Zero companies. Not only our companies using Foundry as our internal infrastructure. They are pioneering the use of Foundry and Apollo as a platform to build [Indiscernible] offerings and consumer software products as well. With Foundry they're doing the faster companies in mobility, building entire data ecosystems in Foundry for connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles of renewable energy Company using Foundry, not just for advanced physics models, but also using Foundry to create a software offering for their customers. A B2B software Company, building an ERP for construction. The founder told us that Foundry is making it possible for him to build orders of magnitude bigger and with less effort. And we've had a lot of questions about when Palantir is going to have a consumer product available. Well, something I can say is that Day Zero companies are building their consumer products on top of Foundry. Take companies like Chapter, whose products helped enroll customers in the right Medicare plans. It's backed by Foundry and delivered through Apollo. We expect to see more of this, and it's an exciting part of our journey. Commercial revenue up 21% sequentially in Q3 quarter-over-quarter. The numbers are especially strong in the U.S., where the U.S. commercial business has accelerated from 72% revenue growth rate in Q1 to 90% growth rate in Q2, now 103% revenue growth in Q3, that's more than doubling year-over-year. And this is driven by continued product innovation and more efficiencies in distribution like -- The acquisition of new customers is accelerating. We mentioned 10 net new customers in Q1, 20 in Q2, 34 in Q3, more than tripling. Commercial revenue has accelerated in every quarter over the last year from 4% in Q4 of last year, 19% in Q1, 28% in Q2, and 37% in Q3. Total commercial deal value is up $2.2 billion. That's more than doubling since last year. Our RPO remaining performance obligations increased 172% to $874 million. And account coverage and distribution channels bring us to great companies like Apache, a large hospital system in Florida, a large e-health insurance provider in the U.S., Kinder Morgan for layoff, Dave & Buster's just to name a few. Rodney Nelson : Great. Thanks, Kevin. Sean, this question is for you [Indiscernible] asks, what is it that will keep Palantir ahead of the competition for the next 10 years? Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Marcellus. Well, that's the trillion-dollar question. Of course, trillion dollar [Indiscernible] is well short of our ambition over the next 10 years. We always have and will always continue to focus on building cutting-edge product that the world needs anticipating the future, operating with precision. We are software Schumann's, building before the need is obvious, always ready to me it's moment as was true with IEDs and the rocket in Afghanistan, the global financial crisis, ISIS attacks in Europe, or more recently with COVID, supply chain disruptions in Afghan Noncombatant Evacuation Operations. With Gotham, we are focused on continuing to build the AI enabled kill chain across every sensor and every shooter covering all domains from space to Mars. Our platforms are modern operating systems for the enterprise. With Foundry, we're creating the nervous system and the cardiovascular system of the enterprise. With OPI, you can expose complex, cross-system actions, in a repeatable manner that enables you to go from sensing business disruptions before they even happened, to changing your business to seamlessly respond, organizing and reorganizing your business around reality at pace. And we just launched Apollo Commercial, this past week. We have already used Apollo to accomplished so much in the world from Edge AI and space, real-time cams with weapons systems to running our global software delivery, free. Taking Gotham and Foundry to where no SaaS has gone before. And today, I talked about Apollo for streaming. It feels like every quarter we are creating things that we could not have conceived, dug ourselves just a couple of quarters before. Central to our value-creation engine that we were focused on solving hard problem. We are focused on creating fundamental value. Most software companies make software that's easy to sell and overtime that corrupts the value of the product. We make software is profoundly valuable, cutting edge product and then innovate on distribution. Rodney Nelson : Thanks, Shyam. Dave, one for you. James K. and Raphael W. ask, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Alex Karp, has been selling a large amount of shares this year. Why has he been selling so much and will these sales continue? Dave Glazer : James, Raphael, thank you for the questions. As we mentioned on prior earnings calls, Karp was granted options a decade ago which we set to expire on December 3rd of this year. Specifically, as a report equity yields 60.9 million options that were set to expire this December. The taxes from the exercise of the options are more than $0.5 billion. And so we've been selling shares along the way to generate funds to pay those taxes. Of the 16.9 million expiring options, he has now exercised 94% of the total. Of the remaining 6%, roughly half or 1.9 million of them will be sold by the expiration date, the other half exercised and as a result, all the near-term expiring options will [Indiscernible]. Rodney Nelson : Thanks, Dave. Shyam, one for you. Antonio (ph ) asks, being a nurse myself, I see great potential for Palantir. In these pandemic times, healthcare workers are the new defense. Does Palantir have a plan to create a product that can help healthcare institutions on how to assign us? Shyam Sankar : Thank you, Antonio. And thank you for all that you and your fellow healthcare workers have done for us over the pandemic. My mother is a nurse, and I've been living this alongside so many, not just in the U.S. but all over the world. I made reference in my earlier remarks to the substantial growth of our healthcare work. The NHS, MD Anderson, 70 academic medical centers to the NIHs, N3Cs, The VA samples nursing home facilities in Japan. [Indiscernible] unique and diverse footprint that I believe positions us to deliver on the necessary transformation in healthcare. And yes, we are absolutely doing the work at the cutting-edge of both research and complex clinical care, but we're also doing the work on operational excellence. The world over COVID has cost for severely exacerbated procedure backlog. There are people that need care -- life-saving care, waiting to be seen. And at the same time many facilities have spare capacity. There is a complex operational problem in maximizing the utilization of scarce healthcare capacity to save lives, but the challenge is multifaceted, staffing, operating theater management, patient management, demand management, and more. But as you highlight, one of the most acute challenges, and we're engaged on it in the U.S. and Japan, is the nursing shortage and staffing optimization. I was recently visiting one of our hospital customers, sitting with their nurses, watching they're being trained on Foundry for the first time. You could feel the excitement. They were buzzing in how they could transform patient scheduling, care delivery, and ultimately, how it was going to empower them to do so much more, so much faster. To me, it was like what it felt like when I was I watching marine being trained on Palantir the -- for the first time in Kandahar a decade or more ago. They were so excited. So generally, the Iron Man suit, it fits them like a globe as these modern day superheroes save our friends and our families. Rodney Nelson : Great Shyam, one more for you before we open up the call, Aaron and Avi asks, what is the future of Palantir 's Public Sector business, including if there are any billion-dollar contracts like the latest U.S. Army wins in the pipeline? Shyam Sankar : Thank you, Aaron and Avi. We are so excited about the government business. It is where our cutting-edge product is meeting its moment. It was an incredibly strong quarter. The wins on CD2, a truly massive program of record at the U.S. Navy, INDOPACOM, the U.K. and Australian Navies, at the VA with the 4-year $87 million contract, at the NIH $60 million 2-year contract, deals at NHS, PEPFAR, FDA, Department of Justice, Department of Energy, the State Department, and more. CD2 is a substantial win. It builds on another program of record that we already won, CD1. CD1. It was an enormous amount of work. We're so proud of the outcome and we believe the CD1 and CD2 together uniquely positions us for future U.S. Army programs are record. But that's just the army. We had incredible opportunity that Space forced and at the Air Force, places that we are investing a lot, we're building on [Indiscernible] Project from [Indiscernible] air force and that forecourt space force reporting to the Space domains awareness platform. A very unique position. We have many independent opportunities to extend the work that we have done under, under USDI and NGA into the Combatant Commands themselves to directly take on near-peer threats and deter the enemy maintaining dominant. Beyond defense, we see immense opportunities in our pipeline across health from the NHF and VA to the NIH and HHS. We see new opportunities within the Defense Industrial Base in its own right as customers to help them with their own manufacturing, but also in being a strategic partner, helping them capture new revenue streams by AI enabling their hardware platforms. This pipeline has aggregated fee in building. And all of this is happening despite the macro headwinds that we've all heard about across government services. COVID's impact on delaying the pace of work. And we are just competing for known opportunities. Our capabilities are so unique, we're creating our own opportunities. The macro factors here are big, big tailwinds for us. Clear consensus on the threat from an aggressive CCP, not only in terms of impacts on demand in the U.S. but also in Japan, Korea, Australia, the UK, the west and her allies broadly. The infrastructure bill, and our fit on the programs and awards that are being driven there. Carbon emissions management, EV charging infrastructure, building on our incredible commercial momentum in the mobility value chain. Delivery of major projects on time and on budget, and more broadly, the opportunity for SIs and primes on infrastructure projects to partner with Palantir, to develop their own high-margin software streams in place of historically low-margin nonrecurring services on our platforms. We are just at the beginning of big secular trends here. Trends that we anticipated and have invested in for years. We are uniquely positioned, cutting-edge product, ready to meet its moment. Rodney Nelson : Thanks, Shyam. Operator, we'll open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed. Brent Thill : Hi, good morning. On RPO, you had a really nice improvement in backlog. I'm curious if you could just comment on what's driving that backlog. And maybe as a follow up for Shyam, just as you look at the go-to-market on commercial, can you give us an update on the direct sales build-out and partnership opportunities there? Thanks. Shyam Sankar : Hey, Brent. Thanks for the question. Great Q3, wrapping a great year with our Q4 guide, we're expected to do 40% revenue growth for the full year. And this is driven by continued product innovation. Also, more efficiencies in distribution, like account based sales, distribution channels. And we're very excited about the progress of our account based sales team. We've hired about a 150 people so far this year. A lot of that has been focused in the U.S. market where we first started. And many are just getting started, but you can see some of the activity that we mentioned. We've more than doubled our commercial customer count this year, and those numbers are accelerating. Growing our installation base is really great because we expand in places where we are. If you look at our top 20 customers, average over $40 million a year revenue, that's up 35% year-over-year. Our average revenue per customer was $8.8 million when excluding new customers. So a lot of room to expand as we expand our customer base. Another big driver, U.S. commercial revenue, where we've seen acceleration. We mentioned up to 103% growth, doubling in Q3. Our forward indicators are also really strong; total deal value up 50% to $3.6 billion, total deal value in commercial doubled to $2.2 billion. Our third straight quarter of accelerating commercial revenue. And just to wrap up commercial revenue up 21% sequentially, quarter-over-quarter. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you for taking the questions. It's [Indiscernible] for Keith Weiss. There was a really nice performance across commercial and government was strong as well. I just sort of -- with the new administration sort of taking in place, in terms of the velocity of those deals and getting those deals signed, any change that you've seen thus far as this new administration versus the prior admin? Shyam Sankar : No meaningful change there. I mean, the government is moving at pace. I think what's really out there is the near-peer threat, and that's become the real pacesetter for not only the U.S. but allied countries as well. And so there's a lot of focus, a lot of speed. We've worked under 4 administrations and have seen consistent continuity across that. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Rishi Jaluria from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Rishi Jaluria : Wonderful, thanks so much for taking my questions, and nice to see continued strength on the commercial side. Just maybe on high level, can you help us understand how the land and expand and go-to-market motion on the commercial side has differed from government in your experience and especially so far this year. And maybe can you talk a little bit about how involved you are at the pilot phase and beyond and maybe what the time-to-value looks like? Thanks. Shyam Sankar : Great, yeah. We talked earlier about the module, though it was a big thing a year ago that really changed how we went to market. The modules have been very successful. Just this quarter we discussed the carbon emissions, management module, and Foundry for crypto. But if we go back a little bit, what we can see is the real success of software-defined data integration, the SDDI and ERP suite modules, where we've been able to really use these modules to meet our customers where they are, predictable price points. It also enables us to really scale channels and enable our partners to help us go to market. So predictable price points, clear problems to go after. And in doing so, we at this point have developed enough success to see that after solving a single problem in an understandable way, it really sets us up to better expand and land the full proposition of Foundry and expand the contract over time there. We really have a lot of faith in the module strategy, both as a direct sales force augmentation and channel partners in commercial. On the government side, we have seen similar success. We actually won a significant program on a module that is based on readiness, and so we were able to compete for a multi-million-dollar program with less - than -a-day worth of effort. Of course, we love how it transforms the economics of our business, but I think the speed-to-value for customers is really what sets it apart. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Hello, Brad Zelnick, your line is open. Please proceed with your question. And we will move onto the next question in queue. Your next question is from Mark Cash from Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Mark Cash : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Sort of multi-part one. So you talked about the recently launched Foundry module around crypto. And I'm just wondering, it wasn't really a press release around that the module kind of appeared so finding new use cases is great, but I was curious if you could talk about the size of the crypto opportunity, but then also the strategy for releasing modules. Is it finding lead customers and commercializing it quietly or really just depends on the market size and the interest. Thank you. Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Mark. Yes, the focus on module is to really meet the customer where they are. Where do we see repeatable challenges that we can create an offering that is very fast to deploy. Last quarter, I talked about how we deployed AML at the largest European retail bank in less than 2 days. This gives you kind of an indicative sense of the performance. We were able to integrate with complicated ERP solutions and unlock that data for customers and ours. So we're -- we start with cutting-edge products. And then where we see the module, we invest in it because it gives us innovative distribution, it enables us both from a direct sales force perspective, but also channel partners and to be really successfully in penetrating the market. Operator : All right. And we do have 1 final question -- have time for 1 final question, which is from Ethan Bruck from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Alex Zukin : Hey guys, this is Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. I just had maybe 2 quick numbers questions. Roughly if we think about Q4 guidance, how much revenue do you expect to come from commercial contracts with investment arrangements in the quarter. And then is it possible to get what percentage of the total RPO would be recognized over the next 12 months? Kevin Kawasaki : So on the investment programs, we're really excited about the opportunity here. Just to repeat some numbers and get some context with our Q4 guide, we're expecting a 40% revenue growth for the year in 2021. That's over $1.5 billion for the year. We raised our cash flow guidance to an excess of 400 million. We've invested about a $150 million through Q3. Total revenue from the program is about 2% of revenue for the year through Q3. And there's about $640 million of total revenue long term from this program at the end of the quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release and related materials issued prior to the market open and posted on our Investor Relations website. This morning, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our first quarter and fiscal 2022 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed prior to market open today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law.  Further, during the course of today's earnings video conference, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Alex Karp : Welcome to our earnings call from Denver. It's my maiden voyage. And obviously, just a couple of opening remarks, and then we'll jump into questions from the audience as it were. The -- just a five-minute, two-minute -- when Palantir began, people believed that data was worthless, that software was a luxury item, and that we would fail. And one of the very interesting things that's happened to Palantir is we've been able to see how the world has changed dramatically in its perception of software and, of course, of us from a world where software was something that you might want, might be in your car, but de facto would not determine your business to a world where really the laws of finance are going to be rewritten to deal with a world where the only real moat is software. How do you measure it? What does it look like? How does it -- how do you understand when it's creating value? How do you understand when it's declining in value? How do you understand when it's compounding? To what extent is it compounding? What devices do we use to measure that? Are the devices we use to measure it the ones that we used in the past? Clearly, this industry is in its infancy. What's also very special about this industry is it really is, by and large, geographically located in a small section of America, which is odd, and there's lots of interesting reasons for that. but enterprise software is something that America is by far the best at. What we see currently at Palantir is not just the best at building it, it seems to also be the best at understanding what software developments are relevant for the world today and adapting even when it's being offered by a company that in every way looks nonstandard, run by people that are very different, look different, feel different, talk differently and with a CEO that many of you is [Expletive] crazy. And so, just as an interesting preview, I don't want to take a ton of time with remarks because I think when I'm watching these things, if someone talks too long or there's like a lot of canned remarks, I wonder why, honestly gets a little boring. And of course, our legal department and IR department, which are wonderful departments are -- have a cane ready to pull me out if I'm not like a caged animal in the 1950 zoo. As I've mentioned to them, if you want caged animals in 1950 zoo, you can watch any other earnings update. So here, you see an interesting chart. We sent this out. Some of you have probably looked at it. Some have maybe even studied it. Some of you haven't seen it. What's interesting here, what I thought would be very interesting for people who are investors, potential investors, also Palantirians, both current and ex, is our journey and what I actually believe this is a metaphor for the journey of all software companies.  We had -- we were very early into whatever you want to call data exploration, building things that would now be understand as useful software for building analytic tools. Some of them were -- and are very, very important for national security and other areas. But then we're not -- obviously, because they were built and conceived in 2004, delivered in 2008, we're not actually able to migrate across the chain into what people need tomorrow, where people are already seeing that they need today, which is essentially not having software as a raw material exploration. You take the data, like it's oil, you pump it out, you churn it, and then you save -- churn the data and you move on, but actually operationally determinative for your business. What you see here is cohort analysis. This is the -- and what you see is from inception of Foundry, the decline of older software products and just the massive exponential growth, obviously, rough math. It's 100% growth year-on-year. And then starting last year, not off of a small integral, which is obviously very important because small numbers can grow quickly even if the software is not strong. Big numbers don't grow quickly if the software doesn't exist, especially given that our sales force is super nascent. We're building it quickly, but we only have 25 fully accredited software. Fully accredited meaning they've been here for nine months or more. And what you see here, obviously, the CAGR here is just unbelievable and in like the 150-plus range, which is super interesting and I wanted to drop the F-bomb here, but I was told that was probably inappropriate, but you could definitely -- we've agreed that this is something like the Phoenix rises. You don't get this. And the other thing that's kind of anti-gravitational about this, that it's easy to forget. This is a company, this is like we've been at this for over 15 years. There are certain laws of nature in business that we are defined, which is that a software company, software usually decays for lots of reasons, decays radically. And so when you see a decline or a software product, it's also basically not part of the law of nature for a software company to build new software. Really, as far as I know, we are the only software company in the world building transformational software this far in. And that's particularly important because most software companies have distribution or they have a product, but they don't have distribution product and the ability to build new products. There's just not a critique. These are great companies. They acquire companies. There are not that many companies to acquire, which is why even relatively weak companies get acquired at a very high price. Let's just look at the next chart, which is USG. USG, you have a very similar phenomenon where you see the inception of Foundry into the USG. This is -- there's a lot here. There's a lot of qualitative stuff here that we can explain, but one of the qualitative things that you kind of can get a sense of is Palantir, the newer Foundry version not only grows dramatically with like -- this is like 65% growth just without looking at it more precisely, but it's over -- it's like over 200% CAGR here, which is also like Phoenix rises kind of thing. But what's qualitatively, particularly important and very protective is these graphs pretty neatly on to what are the programs that are going to grow tomorrow. Where is the future of USG? What do we need in a world where people are recognizing it's very dangerous? And what would the products be that you would need to power that.  And so any case with that, I think we should head into questions. A - Rodney Nelson : Great. Thanks, Alex. Our first question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies. [Operator Instructions] Brent Thill : Thanks. Good morning, Alex. When you go back to the sales expansion -- Rodney Nelson : By the way, we can't see you -- Brent Thill : \u2026through your overall view on what you need to do on the sales force to get that building in the right direction. And what your plans for capacity are at in 2022? Alex Karp : By the way, it would have been wonderful to see you. But yes, I think the question was what can we do to build on our -- building the sales force next year or this year and the next year. The -- so there are really two parts to the question. One part, I think, is just to look at what's happening. And so like what is growing Palantir now and how can we accelerate it. So if you just -- what I want to do in this call and in future encounters is to both, is to kind of -- what I think is happening and just to frame it, what I think is happening at Palantir is you have what you saw in Silicon Valley 1.0 when Silicon Valley actually produced goods and services that people wanted, which was they built dual product, dual-use products and government, and there was a handoff to commercial. And so that's going very well. So you see -- even if you adjust for SPAC organic growth in commercial last year, U.S. was 80% or just under 80%, it's like 76%, 77%. But to your point, so -- and you see dollar -- net dollar retention numbers that you financial people like, how much is it growing? What I would call actually organically, I guess you guys call net dollar retention. Very, very strong like in the 150 range. We have Glazer here, he'll pipe in with the -- but it's roughly in that range. But what we do not have -- you could look at it as a negative, like we basically are doing this with a very, very nascent -- honestly, if I were not on TV, I would say, bunker small sales force. And so like that means two things. What does it mean on the positive side? It means that net dollar retention number is awesome because my understanding of how this happens at other companies, there's like eight people running around begging the person to expand their deployment. That's not happening at Palantir. The salesperson there is the Foundry product, by and large. So obviously, that means we think we can get lift from hiring salespeople. We're doing that aggressively. I think we have about 150 salespeople now. We're in the market to hire aggressively across Palantir, honestly, mostly not salespeople because we believe we live and die based on our ability to build products of tomorrow delivered today. But we're hiring -- going to hire in the range of 200 people. Hiring and getting value out of them are two different things. And so I think one of the things that we will see going forward is how do we play these salespeople, so that we can get as much lift from them as we're getting from the product itself. And we're at the beginning of that. And so it is the part to people we've fully indoctrinated or as normal people might say, trained, are effective, but we've never done this before. There will be -- that's a process, we're also looking at ways to learn from other companies, but that's going to happen over the next couple of years. I think the primary driver of revenue in U.S. commercial this year will still just be the way in which America, the IT organizations are actually beginning to request without knowing Foundry sometimes what Foundry offers. The CEOs assume that this is available. There is no other product on the market that can actually move from data warehouse, which is like there's like five companies, they all offer the same thing. Foundry interacts with all of them. When you move up to the chain to actually solving a real problem because it's defined your business, Foundry is highly differentiated. So we will layer that. I think it's way too early to know exactly the impact. Obviously, to the extent we get this to work, you could expect even higher growth than what we have, although I'm very happy with it. It was like we've doubled USG U.S. commercial now from 50 to 100, 200, I believe we will double it again this year. So any case, these are -- some of this is unknown, but we are working very aggressively.  The other thing I would say outside of the U.S., again, a slightly longer answer, but one of the ways people look at Palantir is if you're going to -- I think the financial analyst likes to -- what we would have called science normalize the data, what you and finance would probably call strip out the inorganic inputs. But if I think if you're stripping out the inorganic inputs, you also have to look at the -- what I would essentially view as an inorganic input of COVID in Europe. If you strip -- and so Europe has been slow for us last year, which is one of the reasons why we were only at 41% last year and growth would be even higher. Europe grew, if you include SPACs at 9%, so slightly above what's probably inflation. But there, we're taking opportunity believing there'll be a handoff from USG to U.S. com to Europe to rebuild with some very, very strong salespeople who've come from the best companies, believing that that's an environment where we can really do that. So like there's two ways to look at this, just on that angle. You could say, well, what could you do to gas charge America? We're working on that and very, very aggressively and most of our sales hires today are focused on that. But there's another more long-term thing. If we're right that the world wants Silicon Valley the way it was, meaning a handoff from government to commercial to the rest -- commercial U.S. to the rest of the world. And with each one with a lag, America to Europe 18 months, the rest of this company only has to grow, everything besides Europe, commercial 38% to get 30% growth in aggregate. So getting Europe to track better, both from a handoff of what happens in America to Europe and with more conventional sales approach is kind of what we're looking at getting done this year and see the fruits of it next year. Brent Thill : And just a quick follow up on the government. I know you had a tough comp. It did decelerate pretty materially in Q1 in terms of the growth. Can you give us your perspective on what's happening on the government side? Alex Karp : Well, there's a couple of things that are happening there. So if you were looking at this more like from a scientific perspective, you had a time series that's 15 years, first thing you would do is say, okay, what's happening in that time series over the 15 years. What you see in U.S. gov is a compounded growth of 30%, but like this, which is the positive of U.S. gov is it's reliable. The sums are big. The quality of the revenue is very high. The -- one of their -- essentially, there are a number of problems, but the biggest problem is barrier to entry, which we've clearly solved and then rebarriers to entry, which we've solved or solving, but that's going very well. And then the second one is lumpiness. Now you -- that lumpiness still exists. And actually, in some ways, it's worse because to get the integral to grow, you need these massive deals. We also have small deals, but the fact that we are on the biggest, most important parts of the U.S. government on our software is. So there's really a twofold answer to your question. One, what will happen this year? Are there -- is there deceleration in actual one over a long time series? The answer is clearly no. But then the question is, if the baseline is 30, how does it get to where we want it, which was like the beginning of last year. And now at the end of last year, and the way that happens is the deals we're already positioned to win actually closed.  And so then you get into the granularity of what will happen in the U.S. government, who gets the deals if there's no new budget. There's a lot of granularity there, which we should probably do a better job of sharing. But the short answer is, it's like huge chair gets pulled first. The people are trying to enter the market first, last, so the new start-ups totally screwed. Because the people who are not sitting on crucial programs, partially screwed. The people that have software that is -- or products that are useful in the past, but have the right connections probably -- another version of this is if you just look at that chart, I showed you with the CAGR on Foundry, these are the most important programs for a dangerous world.  Now I can't go into all the details, but we used to debate with people, especially my academic friends if the world was dangerous. The danger of the world being clear and present to the U.S. government is very protective. It doesn't guarantee that when this integral actually -- how it behaves, but it makes it much more likely that it will happen here and positively affect our revenue which is another reason why I suspect that we will do well. Rodney Nelson : Great. Thanks, Brent. Our next question comes from Palantir shareholder, Chase P. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. First and foremost, congratulations on all the hard work. It seems like you guys have a great team and are executing really well. From a retail investor perspective, the most negative sentiment I hear regarding Palantir is in regards to the dilution of shares outstanding over the past 12 to 18 months and primarily in relation to stock-based compensation that's occurred. Other than the remaining shares to be invested that have already been announced, can we expect further dilution in share offerings going forward? Or is it kind of reasonable to assume that the majority of this was from the IPO process and sort of a onetime event for the company? Once again, thanks, and congratulations on all the hard work and business developments. Alex Karp : Thank you. And I really appreciate you, investors. Thanks for investing and the faith you have in us. Okay. So there's like the simple version, which I think it's like -- so there's really -- there's stock-based comp and there's dilution. Dilution thing, that's a red herring. We're not issuing a lot of new shares, I think it's like in the $9 million range. And so it would be a little coy of me to say that's like no issue, move on. The thing to understand about Palantir and then I want to just take this like, it's actually not the result of the DPO, it's the result of the fact that we were completely focused on building product. We had no earthly idea we were going to DPO like right before we did it. And so most companies are quite frankly built so that the -- when analysts look at it, the primary customer of most software companies is not the client, it's the software analyst. So it's like we, obviously, our primary clients are our clients. which doesn't mean -- and then now we're thinking about how do we expose the data in a way that people on the outside like you and professional analysts and others can look at the data and get a better sense of what's tracking, what's not tracking. But the primary source of a lot of these like questions really comes down to look, we built the company to support the U.S. warfighter primarily and then do \u2013 take dual, use it for the glory of humanity, particular humanity in the West. That was our idea. And because our primary client was not what someone had a hedge fund would think, we didn't actually think of these things from inception. And so now there's a process of normalization. You're just going to see that in going forward on these calls just like how do you normalize, how do you provide data that people are going to look at, how do you provide data that people can understand that they're used to seeing, while simultaneously staying true to what our mission is. It's like our primary clients are the people we're serving. We're in full align with them. And that's why we survive even with the nascent sales force. You can get things to double, which is in sync. So then you get to stock-based comp, which is like, okay, so -- and there's 2 parts of it. Of course, IRI people kind of don't want me to do any kind of forward-looking math, but if you're smart enough to invest in talent, you're smart enough to figure out. There's essentially -- there's the -- how are we comping people, and there will be a normalization that will get us into a range where you would see in a software company within the next 18 months, latest 2 years. But there's essentially -- and that's going to take a little time. It is going to happen, because it's also very much linked to another question, which is how do you actually run the company so it's profitable someday on a GAAP basis, not stripping out comp. And that was also within eyesight. And those are our goals for Palantir because same reason we have no debt. The same reason we have $2.3 billion on our balance sheet. This is a company built for bad times. Bad times means strong finances internally. And that means at some point, you have to be GAAP profitable. You can't be GAAP profitable if you're diluting people or -- correctly your stock based comp is totally -- is not in conformity with other companies. So you're seeing a normalization. This will change. It will change in the relatively near future. It will be linked to other things that we believe are important for Palantir like having a company that thrives in bad times. And we are -- bad times are very good for Palantir because we build products that are robust, that are built for danger. And then the finances internally are actually built for bad times. And bad times means you have free cash flow, the free cash flow turns into GAAP profit.  That means the stock-based comp has to be one that's aligned with our investors also because that's basically -- it's part of a little bit longer philosophical narrative, but like if software is the only moat, then value and gross shares have to be re-evaluated in terms of their value, value only exists if you can actually get a tech node, call it, maybe something besides. And growth only exist if you build a company that is where the technology is strong enough, the business fundamentals are strong enough that the free cash flow actually turns into GAAP profitability, and that's linked to stock return. So this is a priority, both because you care, but also quite frankly, because it is the health of our company, which we care a lot about. Rodney Nelson : Great. Thank you, Chase. Our next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. [Operator Instructions] Alex Karp : We\u2019re neighbours in New Hampshire. Keith Weiss : Also, in New York. So 2 questions. One on the product side of the equation. And the other on sort of the investments into 2022. On the product side of the equation, Alex, maybe hoping you could help us sort of better understand the product road map on a go-forward basis, how you guys are thinking about it from a high level. From our perspective, you guys did a really nice job of better modularizing the platform and made it more adoptable by commercial enterprises. And I think it looks like we've seen that traction in terms of customer adoption. What's kind of the -- on a go-forward basis, is there more activity of that ilk, if you will? Do you create more like prebuilt solutions, if you will, more directly target some of these sort of opportunities that you've been used for, but productize it, if you will? Is that a potential product direction? And then on the other side of the equation, in terms of investment, investing for growth into 2022, I was hoping you could give us a little bit of visibility into the nature of those investments? Is it just sales headcount? Is it the forward deployed engineers? How should we think about where those dollars are being deployed? Alex Karp : Thank you for your question. And so actually, to my perspective, they're very much linked. Our primary investment in growth is product -- is investment in product, and we're doing a number of things in product. The things we've talked about at a general level is kind of making our product more modular. There's a slightly more macro riff here, which is that we were adversarial with IT structurally until recently. We are adversarial because from our perspective, there's a learning process where they had to build these things. Now there's a myriad of companies. They're all honestly, technically hard -- indistinguishable doing data lakes and all sorts of things that help IT people build something that is working for them to do certain things. And we were adversarial because they were like, okay, this Foundry thing, yes, great. But we've already built these things. You would replace this, it may honestly could also make us look bad. No one wants it also. The average sale price for Palantir Foundry across our business, I think last year, it was like $6.5 million. Most IT people prefer a small bite in consumption. You can argue whether that's the right model, but instead of fighting them, it's probably better to figure out a way to get our product more in their hands. So that's kind of the known part. What we've been working on recently, which is less known is what we're really working on is we believe that people are paying a lot now for consumption and compute. No critique. But in reality, that's very much like paying for gas and oil exploration. But what people are really going to want is the ability to use the fully digested product. It's like when you drive your car, that's minerals and oil products and all sorts of chemicals built into your car, finished product. So -- and we're going to build both modules that are reflective of Foundry but also new ones in areas that we understand. And quite frankly, we know will be built in the near future, so the things we know are working, things that we suspect to work in the future so that the nodes not only work separately, but can work together. So de facto, we believe the compute of tomorrow won't be just compute, it will be productized compute. And that's what we're actually working on in rebuilding Foundry. So there's still -- that doesn't mean like the foundry as an aggregate, we can do the whole thing tomorrow thing, massively valuable, and we're working on very, very large deals where companies are like, \"Look, we want to transform what we're doing or take what we're doing and export it to every company in our industry tomorrow.\" De facto, that's a Foundry use case, and I don't think there's anything else that does that, because you can take -- for example, there's a very large company in the health care space, and it's like they have a very interesting way of doing health care. They can't sell to other people without that essentially being a software offering. Building that would be 3 years or it could be 2 weeks. So that, we're very much committed to continuing doing because there's like we're an N-of-1 there. But where we want to be as an N-of-1 on not just making it small, we like that because then we see the IT departments now saying, okay, well, we have all these things. and now we want to migrate here and then selling them something that they can actually bite into. So it's \u2013 because the primary resistance to Palantir has never been lack of sales force, like it's been resistance on inside of the IT structure. And so now we're going to give them something they want and then also build an ecosystem around it. So it's what I think people will want going forward. And so people can stop just buying pure compute, they can buy valuable compute. So that's actually a big project. I would say on that end and on these other ends, which is particularly interesting, I mean, it's obvious, but it's not just the dollars, it's like who's spending them, just like the charisma of what we're doing. We're getting -- we're a company that's like 15 years old and say -- like from revenue, 18 years old from concept for the -- is a company like ours should be getting declining talent. The talent we're getting now is the best in the world. It's the best we've ever gotten. And we're getting people who used to be at Palantir. Everyone knows how good our people who are coming back. Just like. no company of our pedigree gets people coming back. The reason they're coming back is because this is just [Expletive] cool. It's like you do this, you change the world. Now there's a lot of other things we're working on the side to actually make sure. One of the things we failed at, honestly, is capturing the value of what we've done. Most of the products you would see on a map in the industry, any company, they're delivering things we built 7 years ago. We failed in capturing the value of that. We're not going to fail again. We failed in capturing the value of that because we were selling to IT and selling to people in an adversarial way. And we \u2013 sure, we were 7 years, 8 years ahead, but 8 years ahead, but they can actually interact with you. That's not the right way to do it. And we're not going to do it that way. In Americas, we're building specialized salesforce, -- we\u2019ll take longer to get it to work, because we're working. And in Europe, we have differentiated on the idea that -- so if you just look at the raw numbers, if you look at like where we are investing in, it's like sales hires, very high-end salespeople in Europe and then the rest is just like the best tech engineers in the world because we know we get them, we retain them, and it's just very differentiated. Rodney Nelson : Great. Thanks, Keith. Our next question comes from Palantir shareholder, Brian L. Unidentified Analyst : Karp, thank you for furthering the ideals of Western democracy around the globe. Of the 1,000 plus roles that you intend to hire this year, how many of those will be focused on sales? Alex Karp : So we're looking to hire 200 salespeople basically and everyone else is just like in the past. So the way I think about it is like x salespeople, it's like still 75% technical. We're going to try and hire 200 salespeople. And then as I mentioned, we just hired some very high-end sales acumen in Europe. Yes. Thank you for your question, and thank you for being an investor. Rodney Nelson : Great. Thanks, Brian. Our next question comes from Mark Cash with Morningstar. [Operator Instructions] Mark Cash : Kind of going up what you were just talking about. There's been commentary in the past around becoming the operating system for commercial industries. You talked about airline industry. Maybe just talk about health care for a little bit there. But are there other examples, industry examples you could talk about how that's pulling customers to standardize operations around Palantir? Alex Karp : Thank you. Well, there are a lot of -- like a lot of the new deals we're working. So it's like if you look at the time line of Palantir, 2 years ago, it was all kind of -- 3 years ago, it was like analytics and operations. And what you see now is kind of people building off of what -- wanting a standardized productized version of what we did at Airbus, what we've done internally at BP. What we did with William. And so what I can tell you is like, of the very big deals we're working on now, they're almost all this. It's like we used to have to educate people. They didn't believe us. And what's interesting, I do think it's like, obviously, there was also just the COVID distribution thing. I mean COVID distribution in England. England is not one health care system. It's 600 hospitals that our countries. It's like 600 countries -- and this is true. And so just seeing this happen or the networks of people hearing this happen is the reason why you have 80% organic growth in the U.S. ex SPAC and with almost no salespeople. It's because people are now like -- okay, now the caveat here is this is not for everybody. So there's like not everybody wants -- where this is particularly valuable as you have a business that is not protected by a moat, that has -- but has real insights on how to do something and wants to take over their industry. So it's like you're sitting there, you have a product that is maybe the best in the world, maybe the second best in the world, but it's not protected. But you do have insights for your -- in your software, you could take over your market. And that's where we're seeing it. The thing that's really changed is for once, it's not me fighting my way into the person's office and then throwing me out. It's them calling and saying, no, we know this can work. The pilot phase is now or days, and then we're on. And so like -- and we're working on 2 or 3 of these now. It's like -- it's just -- it's very, very exciting. The 1 thing I would say as a caveat though is it's a little bit -- we are both working on this and working on modularization with equal force because -- and they're just not the same thing. Somebody who wants this is not buying modular Palantir, they want the whole Foundry thing. And what they want is, what they want to help with is like, well, how would we identify people to hire the right to your platform? That's actually a big new question, like where can we find people -- they don't have to be Palantir quality software engineers, those are just too rare. But -- and what we're doing with our platform is making it so that just smart people can actually write to it. And so that increases our TAM a lot because smart and smart enough or specialized smart to write code at the level you write it here, those are just completely different TAMs. Rodney Nelson : Our next question is from Palantir shareholder Juan [Vi]. Unidentified Analyst : Alex, my question to you is, in a recent interview, Shyam said that what AWS was for developers of last decade, Foundry really will be for developers of this decade. Can you expand on what paths Foundry has to make available to a broader developer community. Again, thank you for allowing a retail investor like myself to have a seat at the table. I think it's much appreciated. Doesn't go unnoticed. Alex Karp : I see myself as a retail investor, and I have all my assets in Palantir. So I'm very happy to meet another retail investor. I hope -- in any case. So we've done these like founder for builders programs in America and in France, and like it's not charity. It's because we want people in the tech community broadly to learn how to write to Palantir. We also want to learn from them. So that's 1 very important program, not revenue based, but it's essentially very valuable for our tech development and very valuable to get technically literal people on Palantir so they can see what they can do and tell us what they can't do. Then there's the broader commercial. A lot of the companies we've supplied and government agencies side of Palantir, its like they require an ability to write to Foundry or to one of our products as like a core competence. And like so one of the things we know -- so we're obviously figuring out ways how we can train people, how we can make that experience easier, how can we widen the aperture. And by the way, obviously, not just because -- it's like it's not just for the altruistic reasons that are obvious. It's like if you want people who are valuable now to be valuable tomorrow, they must be able to interact with the software platform. So that's like one of the reasons we've had a lot of adoption because if you take a company like Chrysler Fiat, which has very talented people and it's -- they need to be able to write to the platform. And so that's -- and then work with the platform. So we're working on that partly for political reasons and partly because, obviously, it's very good for you as an investor in Palantir and we're proud of that. Rodney Nelson : Great. Thanks, Juan. Our next question is from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. [Operator Instructions] Philip Winslow : I do appreciate the cohort data that you disclosed today. That was very helpful. Just to dig in on that a little bit. Alex, you talked about seeing -- starting to see an inflection where Foundry is getting pulled into some of these commercial deals sort of asking for Palantir without even knowing necessarily that's what they needed. You see that in the cohort number on the commercial side in terms of the new for 2021. I'm curious if we can just dig into that a little bit. Are you seeing specific industries really start to have that aha moment get it? Are there certain use cases that they're leaning into? And then just have 1 follow up to that. Alex Karp : What makes Palantir Foundry valuable is that it's not really industry dependent, and this is crucial for us because we -- our sales force is nascent. So we're very dependent on where either there's a crisis or where, again, that\u2019s crisis or where somebody actually wants to enter a market they're not in and wants to expand. So I would say in the past, we were very, very dependent on manufacturing. So like our high-level engineering companies like BP and others because we de facto needed the engineering talent because no one else believed us as the product was differentiated. Now it is much more standard businesses of all kinds. And so just like really the who's who of American business from like people building tractors to building cars to oil and gas to distribution, and there's no one kind of company where we do not do well, it\u2019s like, yes, we're not going to sell to a marketing company. It's like that we're not -- we don't buy their talking to them. They don't call us. We're not good at marketing, like they apparently are. They're so good at marketing. They don't have to quantify their results. We don't -- yes. So by the way, one of the places, Europe -- one of the interesting ways to look at our business, by the way, since you're in Europe and since I have an affinity to your region, Liechtenstein, it's that Europe in general has like grew slower and that's -- if you assume that comes back online, it's just going to be bombastic. One of the places that we're actually very strong in Europe is Switzerland. And there, you have like a lot of the pharmaceuticals, insurance companies, banks, that can't be mentioned using our products. And I think they use it, honestly, because it's like there's a Swiss quality to Palantir. It's like a very high-quality product. We deliver it. It will work. You're not going to get the charming slap on the back or the steak dinner and your software is going to [expletive] work. Philip Winslow : And then just to follow up on that specifically because obviously, the net retention numbers you have in U.S. government, government in general is huge, U.S. commercial is huge. That's the 1 thing I noticed is with the disclosure of the net retention non-U.S. commercial significantly lower. What drives that? And how do you sort of inflect that higher? Alex Karp : Well, first of all, I do think there's a hand off function, and I think these things are actually repeating what happened in the earlier days in America when it's like where you have a hand off. Built in government because you have more time to actually get it right, hand off to commercial, go to Europe. I do think, in general, certain Swiss institutions, certain German institutions, certain French institutions are not included, where it is slower. Like if you are building something very, very new, it will be adopted a little later. But then there's also just the COVID. The reaction to COVID in Continental -- in Europe was different than in America. While it slowed things down in America, it didn't really stop them. And so I kind of -- what I suspect is going to happen is that Europe because of COVID reopening and because of basically people copying what's happening in highly adaptive America and sometimes in Switzerland, you will see the European cohort grow. But again, to just make it a little more quantitative, we have, I think, 150% net dollar retention in U.S. commercial. Again, a number which we're getting with basically no one holding it up. So I don't know how it works with other companies, but I think if I were a scientist, I want to normalize that number. But even not normalized, this is a very strong number. What we're going to show is net dollar retention in the U.S., and over time, we're going to show how this expands outside the U.S. And that I think what you'll begin to see is that the strength in the U.S. will go outside the U.S. and we'll make our business very, very robust. Rodney Nelson : Thanks, Phil. So Alex, we've taken -- we've received over 1,000 questions from shareholders. Obviously, you can't take them all. Any parting wisdom or parting thoughts that you want to offer about the business to our shareholders? Alex Karp : It's really tough times out there, really tough for a lot of businesses. It's -- a lot of things are going wrong in the world, in our world. It -- the obvious danger, the lack of legitimacy of a lot of our institutions. And I can tell you while at Palantir, we are very, very focused on our business and bad times are very super motivational for us. And when we get to good times, we'll be even stronger. And we're a little bit of a like wacky group of guerrilla war fighters, but we're very much in fighting mode. And not just for us and the West, but also for our shareholders. And yes, I hope to talk to you soon. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Welcome to Palantir's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued prior to the market open and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our second quarter and fiscal 2022 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance, and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed prior to market open today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition, to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures, is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Joining me today on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Operating Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Kevin Kawasaki, Global Head of Business Development. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. I'll turn the call over to Alex. Alex Karp : Welcome to our earnings. We are in London. In past earnings calls and over the course of 2 decades, we've been involved in many of the most important things that have affected Western society. But what makes these times special is the trends that we believed would happen are happening at an accelerating rate. And what's super interesting is why is the broader world so late in recognizing how these things are accelerating. What's happening? What is the genesis of the escapism that our broader : institutions; financial; cultural; legal; technical, why are they escaping to the Metaverse or faculty lounge jargon or political structures that are clearly not solving problems where inputs and outports are totally anti, if at all, correlated. Why is it that we are unable to see the violence that is occurring as truly something that it will be part of our ongoing future and not as episodic? Why do we describe these things as uncertainty when they are certain and are happening? Why is it that our institutions are not even pretending that they will be able to hold the center while simultaneously pretending the center will coagulate to a center independent of new structures, new ways of doing things of new products, new institutions, new ideas? Part of that is we have theology -- theological structures around how we build, for example, in our space products. The theology presupposes that the world will be stable. So specialized things we build for both commercial and, for example, special forces, things that are powering current events now were built over the last 2 decades precisely because if you are in the periphery doing the most sensitive and important work in the world as you need to be able to interact with your software in a way where it's disconnected and reconnects simple problem. Normal software sucks at it. You need a very specialized product. We've been supplying this to the world's most important elite soldiers for nearly a decade under the context of what we call, Nexus Peering.  You need an ability to interact with space where you solve compute and involving the reduction of data using colloquially defined AI tuned by Foundry getting that to the soldier. You need to be able to, in the context of commercial entities, rebuild the supply chain because there's war. Obviously, there's going to be food shortages. There's disruptions. You can no longer get certain resources from countries. You have to get them from others overnight. The system literally presuppose that will never happen, and therefore, fall completely apart when it does happen. There is no plan for when it doesn\u2019t happen. This is why even though we've been completely focused product company that is only focused on these building products and we have new products coming and not as focused on actually convincing people that we're right, they still sell because the other products are not built for this world. You have a financial context. It's like we have raging inflation, we are very likely to see this will increase. The risk of a nuclear event is so much higher than it's being presented in the public world, that it\u2019s almost surreal to watch the coverage. And yet, there's really no idea of what you would do with evaluating the quality of revenue. So that Palantir, for example, we're a company to thrive in good times and we thrive in bad times. We are not built in the way the theologians of our financial institutions would love us to be built. So that you're built exactly like if we had listened to them, we would only be growth and no free cash flow. We're a company that throws off free cash flow. We're a company that expected inflation. We're obviously super committed to the mission. But it was obvious to us even at inception in bad times, the quality of government revenues would be crucial because other revenues would be -- would suffer from inflation. They would have a lower quality, they'd be less sticky. We built these products for the right reasons. And we're not ashamed to say that we're winning maybe because we were right. We didn't want to be right.  But some of this stuff was so obvious. It was obvious that these institutions -- the theology of how we model these things in every context is just corrosive. So you end up with the wrong products, the wrong quality of revenue. So you have growth without free cash flow or free cash flow without growth. You have products that work now that can be hyped up with sales, but clearly are not going to work the day after tomorrow. No ability to build new products. Why would you build new products? You're going to have this perfectly tinkered model, get the institutions to invest in you and acquire all these companies that actually build product. Yes, but it's nearly impossible to build products for tomorrow. There aren't companies to acquire. You actually have to do it yourself. Sure, here and there, you can look for things to accelerate. Palantir has done that. So we -- you have to -- we at Palantir are not fleeing to a different world, whether it's the Meta-world or a theological world or a financial version of theological world or a grad school version of theological world, which isn't even actually academic because academic presupposes interacting with the object from a theoretical perspective, differentiate from the object, not importing a theological preconceived version of the object onto the theory and reimporting that onto the object. Products don't work like that. Reality doesn't work like that.  Palantir, we are playing a critical, crucial and much bigger role than we're allowed to mention or would ever discuss in public and current events. Obviously, commercially, because our partners and other future partners are being disrupted. Their supply chains are disrupted. There's a threat of a disruption in the broader economy. And we are -- and they -- many realize that the reality of a truly monumental, epic and horrific disruption in the form of a nuclear attack is much higher than is being reported. But also in the government context where we are playing an outsized role, and we're very proud of that and we're proud of the people we're able to support. And we're also eager to continue to help to support them. I must also say the people who've watching this, many of whom share our belief, that the future is to be won by people who accept the reality of what it is and not what it ought to be. That you can only change the ought by accepting what is. That you've stuck with us and I hope will stick with us, and we are going to continue supplying the world's most important products to the most interesting, creative and effectual people in the world and continue to thrive as this hybrid company that is both bull and baron, comes into full stride in both environments. But in absolutely anomalous stride when times are rough and people are hiding, Palantir's products are on the absolute front line and you see them in the news every day. And we would love someday to discuss exactly what we're doing. But we are playing a good role in your support and buying into the world as it is, is enormously important to us.  Thank you. Shyam Sankar : In Q1, revenue grew 31%. Commercial revenue grew 54%, accelerating for the fifth quarter in a row. U.S. commercial revenue grew 136%, also accelerating for the fifth quarter in a row. We added 40 new customers, growing customer count 86% year-over-year. We had GAAP operating margins of negative 9% versus negative 33% a year ago, reflecting our continued march to GAAP profitability. And we had adjusted operating margins of 26%. We have been building our company and our products for this world. The stability on which so many models that purported to explain the world rely, it's vanished, if it ever existed at all. We have built a company for the world that is not the world that ought to be. And it is instability, not its absence that makes our software all the more essential. As our customers confront an extraordinarily significant and rapidly escalating conflict in Eastern Europe, runaway inflation disrupted supply chains and a new wave of refugees, our products have become more essential than ever. At our last earnings call, the invasion of Ukraine had not yet occurred. From the moment those tanks rolled into Ukraine, we have been delivering our capabilities to the front. We have been continuously shipping innovation over the course of the conflict to provide western militaries the software that they need to fulfill their missions. Every product and capability has been employed by our customers from Gaia, Gotham, Edge AI, Foundry, Nexus Peering and more. And the newest of them, MetaConstellation, continues to deliver value in making space-based collection truly operational, delivering significant mission outcomes. And we have been working across Poland, Lithuania, the U.K. and other nations to power refugee relief operations. Our software is powering the World Food Programs, Ukraine response, getting aid as Far East as possible. And across our commercial customers, we are powering resilience to a whole new set of supply chain shocks. Real-world events are driving enormous and long-term opportunities for growth. We are on the front lines, seeing what needs to exist, hearing from commanders and users and building now what is needed and what will power the next decade of U.S. and allied defense programs. We did this a decade ago in Afghanistan with Nexus Peering. We did this a year ago with MetaConstellation whose impact writes headlines in The New York Times, and we will continue building this offer of the future, ramping our investment heavily across the business in the face of these Palantir-shaped macro conditions. This focus has delivered tremendous depth in our R&D and our full stack IP. We now have this opportunity, in addition to releasing new products at pace to bring an increasing amount of that innovation to market. And that's what you're seeing with Apollo. We believe Apollo will fundamentally change how software is deployed, anticipating a future where multi-tenant SaaS is dead and is clearly dying in the present, a trend that is accelerated by geopolitical events. Every software company will need to be able to deploy their software into their customers' environments, requiring them to manage fleets of heterogeneous environments across public clouds, on-premises, sovereign clouds and growing data jurisdictional boundaries and to do all of that seamlessly. Apollo will take customers from a world of continuous deployment to autonomous deployment. And we have been pleased with the market reception to Apollo in our Demo Day event, really being received by a completely new buying audience. We are also now offering Nexus Peering as a stand-alone capability for customers to build their own data fabrics on top of. Over a decade ago, we pioneered a technology that enabled Gotham to reason about the causality of a distributed system of many, many different Gotham nodes. These nodes could all have independent concurrent edits to the same objects and Nexus Peering meant that we could synchronize these edits across the network, either in real time with consistent comps as well as across unreliable intermittent and disconnected environments. Nexus Peering means that you have a distributed data fabric that is survivable and resilient. The loss of any number of nodes or facilities won't impact the whole. This is a core and fundamental hard technology breakthrough that has powered Gotham's unique success across coalition information sharing for defense and intelligence agencies. And by enabling Nexus Peering to be sold as a separate capability we can enable every program in the Department of Defense to leverage this distributed data synchronization and data fabric as we further demonstrate our own commitment to DoD's modular open systems approach. The greatest opportunity for Foundry continues to be the application development infrastructure platform. We believe that Foundry will become the place that you go to build the applications of the future. With AWS or Azure with their highly unopinionated collection of services, most of the work remains in front of you to get to value. And all of that onus is on you, the customer, to get to that value. With Foundry, you're 90% of the way there on day 1. Software-defined data integration, native multi-tenancy for your applications, the OPIs, version pipelines, applications, artifacts, to just name some of the components, that make Foundry work from the start. That's why U.S. Space Forces\u2019, Kobayashi Maru factory realized their ambition, building 13 operationally accepted applications on top of Foundry in months while sunsetting legacy $100 million-plus programs. That's why Airbus rolled out an internally developed supply chain network control tower, a suite built on top of Foundry's application development infrastructure. And this set of applications, it mitigates supply chain issues and is working towards saving hundreds of millions of euros annually by speeding up production against existing fixed capacity and reducing inventory across all parts. What AWS was in the last decade, Foundry will be in the next. Turning to the highlights in our commercial business. We added 37 net new customers in Q1. We saw continued growth in automotive, in financial services, in energy, including a new super major customer, and in life sciences. In April, we closed a renewal with a major U.S. Fortune 100 company for over $150 million. This customer hosted a hackathon with over 600 participants featuring applications built in under 4 days across finance, build planning, network resiliency and customer experience. This was a good and telling example of how scaled customers built better on Palantir as application development infrastructure.  Last quarter, we saw continued interest in our modular offerings. Hospitals need to improve operational efficiencies surrounding patient flow and staffing processes in order to decrease the length of stay and ensure patients have access to proper care. Palantir's hospital operation suite has proven a unique ability to solve these problems through collaborative decision-making based on real-time data with targeted, event-driven notifications and actionable AI. Palantir's hospital operations suite is now used by hospitals covering over 37,000 beds across the U.S., up from just over 1,000 on January 1. Turning to government. As instability in the world increases, we continue to double down on our support of the missions of the West's most critical foundational institutions. Our ambition is to be the sixth prime contractor for the U.S. Federal Government, a trusted partner to deliver complex end-to-end integrated hardware and software solutions, building on the legacy of programs that we prime today. But we seek to be the first company to do this as a software prime, using software innovation and our unmatched expertise to deliver new integrated hardware software capabilities faster than the pace of conflict. In Q1, we launched our U.S. Federal Advisory Board, an important milestone in this journey. The war is not just happening on the ground in Ukraine, but also in space. And accordingly, our opportunities in the space universe continue to expand. U.S. Space Force continues to deliver new operational capabilities to America's Space Guardians who have set the gold standard for allies. This is leading to substantial interest in U.S. Space Force's Warp Core platform, which was built on Foundry amongst allied nations. At Space Symposium in Colorado Springs to an audience of U.S. and allied governments, Peter Marquez, the former Head of Space Policy at the National Security Council and the Head of Space policy at AWS, presented Project Argus, a new space situational awareness platform built on Foundry. We closed a GBP 10 million enterprise expansion with the U.K. Royal Navy. Palantir's software is used by the Royal Navy across a broad spectrum of areas from strategic workforce planning to supply chain management. And world events have accelerated our opportunity in Western and Northern Europe. In Germany, we were awarded a framework agreement for state and federal Government organizations to purchase Gotham and Foundry with an initial order coming from the Bavarian police, adding to our existing German security customers in North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesha. Our government health care business grew with an expansion with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The growth of the work is reflected in the doubling of the run rate. Over the past year, while continuing to deliver on the CDC's food-borne pathogen program, which we have been powering since 2009, the CDC expanded Foundry's pathogen surveillance and response work and deployed generalized modules built on top of a common Foundry ontology against new pathogens, including measles, mumps, Legionella and novel flu. The CDC is also using Foundry to process genetic sequence data derived from wastewater samples. On the other side of the Atlantic, our continued investments in software-defined data integration with our newest pipeline builder product continues to pay off at the NHS where they were able to roll out Foundry to 38 hospitals, integrating hundreds of data sets in March alone to enable them to work through the national care backlog. I'll turn it over to Dave to take us through the financials. Dave Glazer : As Alex and Shyam highlighted, we are uniquely positioned for unstable times. We work with some of the most crucial and important institutions in the world. The U.S. government was 42% of our first quarter revenue and has been a leading driver of growth for 8 years with a 30% CAGR from 2013 to 2021, which we view as a long-term trend. More fundamentally, we believe supplying our products to the U.S. government and her allies is a core pillar of our business. As Alex mentioned, in the face of substantial macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges and uncertainty, the quality of our revenue as viewed through growth, margin performance and durability and especially resilience is unique to Palantir. As Alex wrote in his letter, we combine the resilience of the defense industrial sector with the growth of a software company. In the face of our customers' challenges, we have and will continue to incur expenses prior to having contracts in the delivery of mission-critical capabilities. Following these investments, we expect acceleration of our U.S. government revenue into the second half of the year. In Q2 to date, we've already seen the reacceleration of U.S. government revenue and expect acceleration of the overall government segment to follow in the next quarter or shortly thereafter. I'll now review our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook. First quarter revenue grew 31% year-over-year, ahead of our prior guidance to $446 million. Overall net dollar retention was 124%. Commercial revenue growth accelerated for the fifth consecutive quarter. First quarter commercial revenue increased 54% year-over-year to $205 million, up from a 47% increase in the fourth quarter. Commercial growth continues to be driven by our U.S. business as U.S. commercial revenue growth accelerated to 136% in the first quarter, up from 132% in Q4. International commercial revenue growth accelerated in Q1 to 24% year-over-year, up from 22% in Q4 and 7% a year ago. Our U.S. business revenue grew 38% versus the year ago period. Government revenue increased 16% versus the year ago period to $242 million. Adjusted operating margin was 26%, ahead of our prior guidance by roughly 300 basis points. Our customer acquisition continues to accelerate. We added 40 net new customers in the first quarter, up from 34 in the fourth quarter. We had our strongest quarter of net commercial customer adds, adding 37 commercial net adds, which equals 25% sequential growth and 207% year-over-year growth. We expect continued growth in commercial customer acquisition throughout the year. Our growth with existing customers remains strong. Trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 24% year-over-year to nearly $45 million. First quarter billings were $490 million, up 35% year-over-year. First quarter ACV close increased 35% year-over-year on the back of 208 deals versus 81 deals in the year ago period. First quarter TCV closed was $248 million. The U.S. government's businesses TCV has been impacted by the continuing resolution. But now that a new budget has been passed, we're already seeing Q2 U.S. government revenue reaccelerate. Additionally, with the geopolitical landscape outlined by Alex, we expect government bookings activity to increase for the remainder of the year, resulting in stronger government revenue growth in the second half of 2022. We ended the first quarter with $3.5 billion in total remaining deal value, up 26% year-over-year, while duration shortened 4% over the same period. We ended the first quarter with $1.2 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 86% year-over-year. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in our government business. Margins and expenses are on an adjusted basis, which excludes stock-based compensation. Adjusted gross margin was 81%. Contribution margin was 57%. First quarter adjusted income from operations, excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes was $117 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 26%, ahead of our prior guidance of 23%. First quarter adjusted expenses were $329 million, up 7% sequentially. We are spending to position the company and our customers to win in the current geopolitical environment. These investments in product and our customers will continue over the balance of 2022. First quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.02, which includes a negative $0.02 impact driven primarily by unrealized losses on marketable securities. We generated $35 million in cash from operations and $30 million in adjusted free cash flow. Cash flows vary quarter-to-quarter, but it's worth noting the $66 million increase in our accounts receivable balance. At the end of Q1, we had a very strong war chest, $2.3 billion in cash and no debt. In march, we expanded our revolving credit facility to $500 million, up from $400 million previously. And our credit facility remains entirely undrawn. Our balance sheet leaves us ideally positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that may arise from further deterioration of global conditions. Turning to our outlook. We are guiding to a base case of $470 million in revenue for Q2. There's a wide range of potential upside above our guidance, including those driven by our role in responding to developing geopolitical events. We expect second quarter adjusted operating margin of 20% in the base case as we accelerate investments to support our customers' mission in advance of anticipated contract awards and continue to expect full year adjusted operating margin of 27%. We expect and are already seeing an acceleration of our U.S. government revenue resulting from these investments. Continuing to execute the guidance strategy set forth by our CEO, Alex Karp, in our year-end 2020 earnings call with regard to long-term revenue guidance, we are providing and will continue to provide guidance of 30% or greater revenue growth for this year and the next 3 years at each earnings call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rodney to open up Q&A. A - Rodney Nelson : Thanks, Dave. Joining me for Q&A are Shyam Sankar, Dave Glazer and Kevin Kawasaki. Shyam, this first question is for you, Kernish P. asks, are there any new products you're looking to launch in the near future? Shyam Sankar : Thank you, Kernish. We have released so much new product. Pipeline Builder has improved data integration productivity 2 to 3x at the NHS, autonomous sales and operation planning and execution, the hospital operation suite, MetaConstellation, Edge AI and Edge stream. And beyond new product, we are bringing to market 15 years of deep tech that we built to power Gotham and Foundry. Nexus Peering, our distributed data fabric is going to power the next decade of DoD programs. Apollo is going to take our customers from continuous deployment to autonomous deployment. And this is what we're focused on. Everything else, financials, performance, those are the consequences of our execution on this focus. We build software the world needs before the world knows it needs it. The prescience of our software arises from a deep love and respect for the institutions that are acquired for the world to function and a deep understanding of the macro and geopolitical shifts that some might say are coming, but we would say have already arrived. And the practicality of our software arises from the deep love of our users, the humans who are at the coal face who do the hard work day in and day out from the factory floors of Detroit to the cold concrete floors that refugees are sleeping on in Warsaw. We build software for the world as it is today to help our customers and their humans manage to get to the world that ought to be. Rodney Nelson : Thanks, Shyam. Dave, this next question is for you. Daniel L. asks, what is Palantir doing to reduce share dilution? Dave Glazer : Thank you, Daniel. This is actually something that is repeatedly misunderstood. If you take a look at last year, we only added 0.004% in fully diluted shares outstanding in the entire year. If you flip to the first quarter of this year, that fully diluted number actually declined for the quarter. So you literally ended Q1 with fewer shares than when it started. Rodney Nelson : Thanks, Dave. Shyam, this next question is for you. Noah A. asks, Alex Karp said bad times are good for Palantir. What is Palantir doing during this time of war, inflation and hyperpartisanship to back up Karp's words? How is Palantir solving the world's current greatest problems? Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Noah. This question is really important. The answer to it is literally Palantir. It is the reason that we exist. As Alex has mentioned many times, we have been building our company and our products for this world. As our customers confront rapidly escalating conflict in Eastern Europe, runaway inflation, disrupted supply chains and a new wave of refugees, our products have become more essential than ever. I've already talked about how we are helping governments respond to Russia's invasion and the resulting humanitarian disaster from MetaConstellation and Edge AI to powering refugee and relief operations. But it's also important to understand that a chain of events has been set in motion, a Rube Goldberg like set of bangs, boings and ricochets that extend and will continue to extend into every facet of the world. Food is short and prices are exploding. The availability of fertilizer required to grow more food is disrupted. Commodity prices are sky rocketing. Neon gas, CF46, palladium, all disrupted, all crucial in the semiconductor supply chain. Ukraine is a major regional center for clinical trials. All of those trials and the life-saving medicines behind them are now disrupted. Simple, but essential automotive components like wiring harnesses and seat belts are disrupted. All of this is coming on the back of a set of dynamic disturbances from COVID and the resulting supply and demand shocks people are still coping with and the emergent wave of shocks that will come from extended and severe lockdowns in China. To solve these problems, you cannot operate on software that was built to assume a stable world. In the stable world you can make plans and you edit it occasionally. The plan is static. The assumptions are fixed and immutable. In the real world, in this world, you only make a plan so you can change it. You need all of your data ontologized into your digital twin, flowing into dynamically delivered applications that connect to each other. You need your AI to move faster than the rate of disruption. When something goes wrong, it needs to tell the person at the coal face what to do next. Inflation flowing through your supply chain means you need an entirely different approach to manage suppliers, logistics, production and S&OP. Our work with Tyson Foods is delivering $10 million of value realization every week by moving them from legacy approaches like integrated business planning to autonomous sales and operations execution by moving from a static plan that was assumed to be right to autonomously planning where you go turn by turn as they are dynamically updated to navigate around unforeseen obstacles. Literally, every function of every business is breaking under the stress of these events, events where the aftershocks are strong and more profound than the initial earthquake. And Foundry was built for this. Rodney Nelson : Dave, this next question is for you. Deepak C. asks, when is the company targeting to be GAAP profitable? Dave Glazer : Thank you, Deepak. We had a negative 9% GAAP operating margin in Q1, an improvement from negative 14% in Q4 and from negative 33% in Q1 2021. So we're making significant progress. And Q1 was our strongest gap quarter-to-date. And not to mention, last year, for the full year, we posted $424 million in adjusted free cash flow with a 31% adjusted operating margin. And we're already off to a strong start this year. But with that said, we're preparing for a world that has the highest chance of a nuclear war in my lifetime, let alone since my parents were kids. And as Alex discussed, the quality of our government revenue as viewed through growth margin performance, durability and resilience is unique to Palantir. We think this uniqueness will be incredibly important in the quarters to come. Rodney Nelson : Thanks, Dave. Kevin, this next is for you. Jackson K. asks, can you comment on the SPAC partnership strategy and its impact on the financials? Kevin Kawasaki : Sure. Thanks, Jackson. Revenue from these contracts has peaked in Q1 at around $39 million. And we will not have additional new customers from this program as we've wound the program down. Going forward, expect about $30 million of revenue per quarter from these customers. Revenue in Q1 is higher as a result of some catch-up of about $9 million recognized in the quarter, reflecting work we started last year. We also saw roughly a negative $0.02 impact on earnings per share from the marketable securities. When you look at this by geography, you'll see continued strength and growth in the U.S. business, ex-SPACs, growing at 65% year-over-year and 9% sequentially quarter-over-quarter. We had our strongest quarter for winning new commercial customers overall. Commercial customer count up 25% sequentially and up 207% from a year ago. And in the United States, commercial customer count grew 368%. We expect continued growth in commercial customer acquisition. And as Alex mentioned, we see a path to double our U.S. commercial revenue again. Rodney Nelson : Great. Thanks, Kevin. Shyam, one more for you before we open up the call. Michael P. asks, in the FY 2021 business update, there was a reference to Ops PI as a Foundry capability or perhaps module. Could you elaborate on the problem this solves and what value it delivers to Foundry users? Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Michael. When you think about Foundry, there are really 3 high-level massively differentiated capabilities. The first is that Foundry makes the marginal cost of data integration approach zero, with software to solve data integration, with pipeline builder, with all this data integration technology, we have software that writes its own data pipelines for you. This gets you to the starting line quickly. It helps you answer the question, how am I going to bring all my data together? How long is that going to take? And how do I deal with the fact that there's new types of data created every single day? The second capability is that Foundry makes the marginal cost of application development approach 0, no code, WYSIWYG application builders for robust interconnected applications. Importantly, these are not dashboards. These are applications that read and write to your existing enterprise transactional systems like your ERP, your general ledger, your warehouse management system. And third, Foundry has native modeling and simulation capability that lets you interact with the digital twin of your enterprise. So yes, you can compute something like an optimized production plan. But even much more importantly, you can respond to real-world surprises in real time.  The best analogy I have for this is that current technology is like most people are using something like MapQuest where you put in a destination and then you print out the map. Foundry is like Waze where, yes, you put in the destination, but we are dynamically computing the best way to get there all the time, turn by turn based on the ever-changing facts on the ground : traffic, construction, accidents, road closures. While the competition is stuck in the traffic jam, you're raising across the finish line. So all of this is possible because Foundry is a digital twin of your business, and that is powered by Foundry's ontology. So with our ontology, we're modeling not just the nouns, but also the verbs of your business, the actions that you can take. So that means you cannot only realize that there is a's problem with your production plan based on real-time data, but also compute the correct answer, the correct plan and push that transaction to your ERP system. And all of that amazing capability has historically only been available for applications built inside of Foundry. The OPIs, they change all of that. The power of the ontology can now be used by any application in the enterprise, whether it's first-party apps developed by IT or third-party apps developed by IT suppliers and independent software vendors. The OPIs are clean, syntactically sugary sets of restful APIs. I like to think about it as serverless enterprise orchestration. It's Lambda, but for your enterprise, simple abstractions that make the authentic complexity of the real-world businesses manageable and programmable. Rodney Nelson : Thanks, Shyam. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Regarding the government business, can you talk to the acceleration that you're seeing in the business? And I think you called out the United States as where you're seeing the reacceleration. Can you also speak to the rest of the world and what you're seeing there? Shyam Sankar : Absolutely. Thanks, Brent. We've been working with the U.S. government for 15 years. And over the last decade, we've seen a 30% CAGR, and that covers times at peace and times of conflict. And I've already talked about our involvement with current events and the role that we're playing there. And you can kind of see the reacceleration starting to happen with the wins. The work that we're doing with DSG CD2, which was literally built for a land war in Europe. The expansion of the work that we have with the U.K. Royal Navy, the framework agreement that we have in Germany with state and local police covering Bavaria, North Rhine-Westfalia, Hesha, the work that we're doing in space with U.S. Space Comm and Warp Core, but really the knock-on opportunities that creates for us with allies as they approach space.  And so the end result of this is that in Q2, we've started to see the U.S. government business reaccelerate. We're doing a substantial amount of work right now where we are investing in our customers, and we expect that work to have both short term but also longer-term payouts. We're doing work now that matters and will likely be contracted. But we're also doing work that is defining the requirements for defense procurements over the decades to come here. Rodney Nelson : Thanks, Shyam. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : I'm hoping that you can. I think you guys might have come -- cut out on me. But I wanted to double-click on the range of upside that you referred to in your Q2 guidance. How much of that variability is coming from commercial versus government? And how should we think about the variability and what it means for your 30% revenue and 27% margin guide for the full year? Dave Glazer : Thank you. So in this macro environment, we feel very well positioned for the full year and beyond. Our U.S. government revenue represented 42% of our Q1 revenue, and a significant amount of this is in the defense space. Our commercial business has been outpacing the government business, accelerating in each of the last 5 quarters to a 54% growth rate in Q1. And as Shyam just mentioned, in Q2, we've already seen some reacceleration in the U.S. government business, which we think is a long-term trend and expect acceleration of the overall government segment this quarter or shortly after. Rodney Nelson : Great. Thanks, Kevin. Our next question comes from Mark Cash with Morningstar. Mark, you can go ahead. Our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Rishi Jaluria : I really appreciate it. Maybe I just wanted to go a little bit more into understanding the range of outcomes in Q2. You talked about maybe where you can get a little bit more upside. Can you walk us through maybe a full set of assumptions there? And more importantly, when there's a base case and you're hinting at a bull case, what is a potential bear case that you would be thinking about in Q2, just given everything that you're seeing going on from a macro perspective? Shyam Sankar : Look, the base case is really establishing how we're thinking about the visibility that we have. The upside is quite large. I mean a lot of this comes down to contract timing and the acceleration of events. There's a fair amount of work that's in flight here. The way that we engage with customers is we're not going to deprive you of help in your moments of greatest need when you're at war because paperwork isn't in yet. And so we think we have visibility into the upside. We're not going to comment on the specifics of it, but it's meaningful. But it's also hard to predict. And what we need to be focused on right now is just delivering not only because of what implies for this quarter, the next quarter and this full year, but what it implies for the long-term growth of the business and the relevance we have to solving the most important problems in the world. Rodney Nelson : Great. Thanks, Shyam. That concludes Q&A on today's call. I'll turn the call back over to Shyam Sankar for closing remarks. Shyam Sankar : Thank you, Rodney. Look, we feed our culture every day through the direct exposure that we have to our mission from the factory floors of European manufacturers to the cold concrete floors that so many refugees are sleeping on. In Q1, many of our people had the chance to go to Poland, Romania and Lithuania to stand up the software infrastructure to power refugee operations, processing nearly 100,000 people a day. And we are involved in supporting the military as they execute their sacred duty. Much as we positioned the entire company around COVID and delivered outsized impact to global health agencies and health delivery organizations, as we stabilize production and supply chains now, we will throw our entire company behind the most significant set of geopolitical and macroeconomic situations and generations. Our company was built for this. Our software was built for this.  Back to work.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Welcome to Palantir's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued prior to the market open and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our second quarter and fiscal 2022 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed prior to market open today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures, is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Operating Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; Ryan Taylor, Chief Business Affairs and Legal Officer; and Kevin Kawasaki, Global Head of Business Development. I'll now turn the call over to Alex. Alex Karp : In the last 3 years, we have grown Palantir from a 743 revenue business with hundreds of millions of dollars in actual loss to, in the last 12 months, a $1.74 billion business with $300 million in free cash flow, which represents a 41% CAGR. 41% CAGR on a business that is now in its 18th year is very unusual. There are many reasons for this strong growth, but you live by the same sword that you pay the price for. And we deal with very, very large contracts. And the USG has some of the large -- our largest contracts, and they have been pushed out. But because of uncertainty towards the end of the year, we're revisioning guidance down to $1.9 billion. I personally remain very optimistic that the next 3 years will look a lot like the last 3 years, again, where we took a money-losing business and made a business that throws off free cash flow, where we ended up as of today with $2.4 billion in the bank and no debt, and that the large and chunky nature of our contracts will continue to be in large part an advantage because these contracts do not disappear. Sometimes, they are put off. Sometimes, they take too long for us to get them. But at the $1 billion range of the contracts that we are working on, they have the bug of sometimes taking too long and the feature of a highly difficult, tumultuous and politically uncertain world that you actually get paid and you actually make free cash flow. Moreover, we have 5 of the most interesting, important and crazy baller, impactful products in the world : PG, Foundry, Nexus Peering, MetaConstellation and Apollo, all of which were built before their time, all of which have made a 41% CAGR possible. These products should be measured not just in their ability to throw off free cash flow, to generate outsized revenue, but most importantly, in their quintessential attribute that large companies, which essentially control distribution, cannot easily copy them or if at all, they are too [intricate] (ph), difficult and thick to be replaced by larger incumbents and then distributed through their distribution chain. In the end, all software products actually have to be measured by is this replaceable, how easy could it get replaced, is the underlying platform durable or fleeting, and could a third-party highly technical with massive distribution disrupt these products. If you look closely at PG, Foundry, Nexus Peering, MetaConstellation and Apollo, as different as they are, they have one thing in common, it would take many, many years of the world's best engineers to build them and it would take -- you would be building them as we've improved them and as we capture the market. Thank you. Ryan Taylor : Thank you, Alex. We have the great privilege of being on the forefront of the problems that matter most in the world, from the war in Ukraine to fighting famine and monkeypox. Across government and commercial, the opportunity in front of us is enormous, which makes the revised near-term outlook, all the more disappointing. It doesn't come close to representing our ambition and the opportunity before us. While the timing of large contracts in government can be frustrating, the underlying requirements and needs are enduring. It's worth noting that our revised guidance excludes any new major U.S. government awards. At the same time, we have seen the opportunity presented by this environment before. As organizations around the world face more pressure and experience more pain, there will be a slowdown in the rate of spending and lengthening of sales cycles, but it will also reveal gaps in enterprises operations. Gaps our software can solve. In the short term, this means less revenue now. But on longer time horizons, it accelerates our business. The global financial crisis, ISIS attacks in Europe, the COVID pandemic, through each upheaval, we emerged substantially stronger by investing in our customers ahead of revenue and delivering results in days, not months. It is exactly in times like these that we build our most important and most impactful partnerships. Each of these periods has been an inflection point for Palantir, a time during which we developed pathbreaking software platforms and expanded our footprint. To our results. We generated $473 million in revenue in Q2 2022, representing a growth rate of 26% year-over-year and 6% sequential. Our customer count increased to 304, up from 169 a year ago. Our business in the United States alone generated more than $1 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 42% growth. I'll now hand it over to Shyam. Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Ryan. Our revenue growth in the U.S. commercial market continues to be our focus and is gathering momentum. Our U.S. commercial business grew 120%, rising from $39 million in Q2 2021 to $86 million this quarter. Our core U.S. commercial business, which excludes strategic investments, grew 10% quarter-over-quarter or greater for the past 4 quarters, most recently reaching $67.4 million, 14% sequential growth. Our core U.S. commercial ACV grew 2.4x, our best quarter ever. Our U.S. commercial customer count grew from 34 to 119 customers year-over-year. Our overall commercial revenue grew 46% and continued to increase for the ninth quarter in a row on a quarter-over-quarter basis, reaching $210 million in Q2. We are seeing former customers, particularly those in the U.S., including some of the world's largest transportation, banking and retail enterprises return to our platforms in increasing numbers after periods of experimentation with other platforms and approaches. These customers, they're not returning to our software platforms merely because of the expansion of our sales operations, which does continue, they are often returning because they have tried other options, and those options have failed to deliver needed results. Our commercial business in Europe and elsewhere outside the United States continues to expand as well, although the exceptional strength of the U.S. dollar has been a factor given the significantly increased effective cost of goods. Our government work remains at the center of everything that we have built and everything that motivates us. The expansion of our reach with agencies working on the front lines and conflicts around the world, including in Eastern Europe and the South China Sea, continues. The contracts we have in our pipeline are key to facing the challenges in front of the West. Our government business grew to $263 million in revenue in Q2, rising 9% quarter-over-quarter. More broadly, across the commercial and government sectors, health care has become a substantial and rapidly growing business, generating approximately $153 million in revenue in the first half of 2022, up from $42 million in the first half of 2020 at the onset of the pandemic. That represents a 91% compounded annual growth rate. We see substantial opportunities for Palantir as a health care technology company, driving transformation across major pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, insurers, providers, regulatory agencies and research organizations, building on our work with organizations such as the U.K.'s NHS, U.S. HHS, the CDC, the FDA, the NIH, Sanofi, Merck and SOMPO\u2019s health care business in Japan. Our software products and platforms continue to operate behind the scenes in connection with some of the most significant events around the world, including the distribution of vaccines to millions in an ongoing war in Eastern Europe. One of our most recent offerings within Foundry, a no-code application development environment known as Workshop that allows users with little or no coding experience to build operational applications on top of data warehouses within minutes is showing particularly strong growth with more than 10,000 developers now building applications within the platform. And our most recent offering, Pipeline Builder, brings this same no-code approach to authoring data pipelines, turning every business analyst into a production data engineer in Foundry. We just launched an experimental feature that leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 to turn natural human language into pipeline logic, a sentence like \u201cfind me all the hospitals that have limited ICU bed availability in the next 3 weeks\u201d is transformed into a pipeline in seconds, a new standard in no-code. Forrester named Foundry the leader in AI platforms as part of the Forrester Wave AIML Platform\u2019s Q3 report. Palantir's Foundry operating system received the highest possible scores in the product vision, performance, market approach and applications criteria. Turning to Gotham. Urgent operational needs are driving innovation in our integrated hardware software offerings, building on products like TITAN. [Scikit] (ph) will combine Palantir's MetaConstellation software on a small human portable form factor with Starlink comms to enable heroes in the field to test low-latency, AI-driven satellite collection. Our focus in the short term remains on making our 3 principal software platforms, Gotham, Foundry and Apollo, available to broader segments of the market with unbeatable time to value. I'll turn it over to Dave to take us through the financials. Dave Glazer : Thanks, Shyam. As we've highlighted, our U.S. business is remarkably strong. U.S. revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $290 million, and on a trailing 12-month basis, U.S. revenue grew to $1.04 billion. U.S. commercial revenue grew 120% year-over-year to $86 million. Our core U.S. commercial revenue, which excludes our strategic investment program, grew 14% sequentially. On the customer side, our net new U.S. commercial customers grew 16% sequentially. U.S. government revenue increased 27% versus the year ago period to $205 million, up from a 16% year-over-year increase in the first quarter. Turning to our global top line results. Second quarter total revenue grew 26% year-over-year, ahead of our prior guidance to $473 million. Our overall net dollar retention was 119%. Commercial revenue increased 46% year-over-year to $210 million. Government revenue increased 13% versus the year ago period to $263 million. Our global customer acquisition remains strong. We added 27 net new customers in the second quarter, bringing our Q2 2022 customer count to 304, an 80% increase year-over-year. We added 19 net new commercial customers, which represents 157% growth year-over-year. Our growth with existing customers also continues to remain strong. Trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 17% year-over-year to $46 million. Second quarter billings were $396 million, up 5% year-over-year. In the second quarter, TCV booked was $792 million. U.S. TCV booked was $588 million. As Alex mentioned, we saw that large new USG contract awards have been pushed out. While government bookings grew quarter-over-quarter, increasing 128% sequentially, this was primarily driven by renewals. We ended the second quarter with $3.5 billion in total remaining deal value, roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. Despite the excellent TCV quarter, total remaining deal value was impacted primarily by 2 things. One, we voluntarily terminated several contracts related to investment commitments that we decided to not move forward with. Two, our TCV number included the successful conversion of option years from a U.S. commercial customer contract that are resulting in lower overall deal value secured commitment for additional years. We ended the second quarter with $1.2 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 79% year-over-year. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in our government business. Turning to our margins and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense was 81%. Second quarter adjusted income from operations, excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, was $108 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 23% ahead of our prior guidance of 20%. Second quarter adjusted expenses were $365 million, up 11% sequentially. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was negative $0.01, which includes a negative $0.05 impact driven primarily by losses on marketable securities. We generated $62 million in cash from operations, and our adjusted free cash flow was $61 million, representing a margin of 13% and our seventh consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow on an adjusted basis. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have generated $314 million in adjusted free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. In July, we expanded our revolving credit facility by adding a $450 million new incremental delayed draw term loan facility, which provides for additional liquidity up to $950 million and remains entirely undrawn. As we highlighted last quarter, our balance sheet leaves us uniquely positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that may arise from the larger macroeconomic environment. Now turning to our outlook, we are presently guiding to the third quarter and full year 2022. For the third quarter, we expect revenue of between $474 million and $475 million and adjusted operating income of $54 million to $55 million. For full year 2022, we now expect revenue of between $1.9 billion and $1.902 billion, and adjusted operating income of $341 million to $343 million. This revised guidance excludes any new major U.S. government awards, and we believe this to be the base case. With that, I'll turn it over to Ana to start the Q&A. A - Unidentified Company Representative : Thanks, Dave. Our first question comes from Martin who asks, when are you expecting to become profitable? Alex Karp : Thank you for your question. Yes, we -- driven by our 5 products and by our ability to control costs mainly because we left Palo Alto, which we left primarily for political reasons, but of course, Palo Alto is somewhat of a inelastic luxury product, meaning you must pay and pay and pay for the comfort of having oddly misaligned with American interest political views and in general, high cost. That combination of radical optionality on expenses and what we perceive to be macro conditions converging with product conditions allow us to kind of see what we think will be a profitable company in 2025. Unidentified Company Representative : Great. Thanks, Alex. Our next question comes from Jose who asks, what is your 10-year plan for the future? Alex Karp : Well, we built 5 products. Those of you who follow us know them well. Those of you who don't follow us know them well because they've influenced your life, especially PG, our anti-terror product; Foundry, which is responsible for any vaccination you've had if you're listening to this from America and Britain or 20 some other countries. Those of you who are following the war know some of our other products even at a distance, and a number of other products. We are going to continue to deploy those products. By the way, as you may have noticed, we've now crossed the $1 billion mark a second time when we DPO-ed. There was a real question, could Palantir cross the $1 billion software mark? This is a massive mark for enterprise software. We've now crossed this in America. We will cross that for all 5 of our products. Obviously, Foundry will be a multibillion-dollar product. We will do this in the service of the West, which we will fight to help win, rejuvenizing institutions the way we have in the past on numerous fronts. We will use the distribution network we have built to provide them, these institutions with new and better products. Apollo will be a multibillion-dollar product as a standalone product. Our company will be, as of -- in the next 2 years, a 70% dollar revenue company, and we will preserve our culture. And we are going to do this our way, essentially, which is a very long-term focus, do not expect us to be like another company. We will make aspirational goals. I think there's a lot we could learn, by the way, on modeling these goals and -- but we believe we're the best in the world as software for the West. And with the attributes and awards of that, we will push forward to make the West stronger and better and build multibillion-dollar company on top of each one of our single products. By the way, we'll build new products. We're already working on a number of products. We have products like Nexus Peering that are not apparent to the world that power very important things, and we'll continue to build those kind of products as well. Unidentified Company Representative : Thank you, Alex. Our next question is from John who asks, what are you doing differently from your competition that is allowing you to be successful? Alex Karp : Well, we're doing -- I mean, we're not -- we're pretty orthogonal to our competition. So I wouldn't even like -- and by the way, I would say we're less competitive with our competition than -- we have a lot of people compete with us, most of the companies that kind of are built for Wall Street, which have perfect financials and have perfect proclamations of what they're going to hit and very, very thin products, sales forces that are 50% of their total people. The sales in the U.S. commercial, which are by any standard [unanimously] (ph) strong, almost 80% growth this year without specs. Total organic revenue. It's being driven by 42 salespeople, less than 1.5% of our company [Indiscernible]. We have more, but those are the ones that have actually learned our product and are able to sell it. This is a company -- we have this -- and because there's some real features, we've built this product. The product is obviously ahead of the market. We believe the growth in the U.S. I mean, you can tell our trend line of this is doubling now again or close without specs. You could see how this could double or be in that range again next year. And again, we're doing this in a completely unique way. And so then I would also say, as like competition, one of the things that is just not paid attention to at all by normal -- the normal investing company is the very basic fact of is this a product that will be, in some ways, replicated by the big companies? Wonderous, truly interesting, great companies, but that will basically take thin products and get them into their offering and have better distribution. And in fact, in the end, the products are over a long period of time, relatively worthless. So you get a high growth built on back of selling equity and going into -- and taking equity and buying a sales force and selling a thin product, which is no longer going to be around in a couple of years, either because it will not be useful or because a big company will replicate it and sell basically the same product. Our products are not like that. Nobody is really endeavoring to take -- to do a version of PG or Nexus Peering, which people don't understand, which is powering defense efforts globally. Foundry is very thick, and there's essentially hundreds of products integrated and can be -- and deployable quickly. You have Apollo, these are very, very unique products. And so what I would say on the competition thing is it is surprising how different we are from other people and broadly speaking, in the same space. And that has some advantages. We see enormous traction on our products. You're also getting this at a price because we run this company as owners, and we do not run it purely to actually make people happy quarter-to-quarter. I honestly don't pay a lot of attention to that. I'm paying attention to where will the company be in 2 years and what will the products be like in deployment. Will they be adopted? Who's building them? How are they going to be built? And are they, in fact, in front of the market? So we have this very unique hybrid. You have to look at it as a unique company and assess it as, well, what feature set do I like? What bugs set do I not like? Unidentified Company Representative : Great. Thanks, Alex. I'll turn to you, Shyam, for this next one before we open up the call. Christopher asks, can you explain to Palantir shareholders what becoming the sixth prime for the U.S. government and the first software prime would mean for the company? Also, what sort of timeline are you targeting to become the first software prime of the U.S. government? Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Christopher. Our ambition in the U.S. government and by extension, all of government, is to be the sixth prime contractor. And that means that we're the trusted partner capable of delivering end-to-end platforms and programs that we're willing to invest deeply in the specific needs and requirements for these customers. But we just want to do this as the first software prime, and we already are. The way that we think about our products and government is as offerings that are built with our platforms. They're built with Gotham, with Foundry and Apollo. The products would be, for example, at the U.S. Army, Vantage, TITAN, CD1, CD2, massive programs of record, or Operation Warp Speed's Tiberius. That's their vaccine management platform that was built with Foundry, DCIPHER at the CDC, Project Brown Heron at the Air Force, Warp Core at the space force. At INDOPACOM, it's the Mission Partner Environment. TITAN would deliver a next-generation, expeditionary, scalable and maneuverable platform that is purpose-built to address the Army's number one gap in large-scale combat operations, Deep Sensing. In simpler terms, it's an armored truck that connects to satellites and theater assets, and we are offering an end-to-end integrated hardware software solution here. This is exactly what we're doing with [Scikit] (ph), fusing MetaConstellation, Starlink, a purpose-built compute platform to enable war fighters to task satellites from the field and receive low-latency, AI-driven detections to drive kinetic operations. Look no further than the CCP's intimidation exercise in Taiwan still ongoing. We think this being the sixth prime is how we rebuild the arsenal of democracy. Unidentified Company Representative : Thanks, Shyam. Our next question comes from Brent at Jefferies. Brent, please turn on your camera, and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Brent Thill : On the government side, I'm curious if you can address what you're seeing and some of the deals that you expected to close, can you give us a sense of kind of timing on the government side? And I had a quick follow-up question for Alex. Alex Karp : Do you want to take this, and then I'll do the -- and I'll give my -- Shyam Sankar : Sure. Look, the programs that we're going after, these are enduring programs. The competition is ongoing. The needs that we're servicing here are vital to the future of the West on both fronts of the potential conflicts. We have revised guidance given the clarity that we have around when we think we're likely to get them. And so we continue to invest in these things. The pipeline around the government business continues to be really robust, both domestically and internationally. But we also have more certainty around what is obviously a frustrating contracting experience. Alex Karp : Let me give you a different riff on this. So a number that -- I don't know, I think we shared in one of our earnings calls was that our government U.S. business has a CAGR over a decade or more of 35%. During that time, we've had a number of years that were flat, and this is frustrating. Believe me, it's more frustrating for us than anyone else because we would prefer an even lower CAGR, but having more certainty. And so nevertheless, you can ask yourself the question, does it appear that the last 10 years were less dangerous or the next 10 years are going to be more or less dangerous than the last 10 years? So it's just a very basic view that we have. The next 10 years, the next 2 years are clearly more dangerous. America's engaged on multiple fronts. And then there's a question, does Palantir have the product market fit and access to the market? Our product, we're looking at the U.S. business that's going to cross the $1 billion mark next year as well. This is like so you have a $1 billion software business as of next year with positioning that has never been as good. So both our micro positioning and obviously, the macro position, it's so sublime. It's hard to talk about without sounding like we're kind of warmongering. And that's why I am positing internally and externally the growth in U.S. government over a multiyear period will be at least as good in the future as it was in the past. However, that 35% CAGR included a number of years where it was flat or even negative, and that's just the frustrating part about contracting at our level. The contracts are so big and meaty that you got to kind of wait. Brent Thill : And just a quick follow-up. When you think about the overall macro conditions that seem to be hitting a number of other software companies, can you discuss what you're seeing on the commercial side? Any slowdown there? Or are you seeing the business stay -- Alex Karp : One of the things because, and we're not exactly sure how I ought to put this, but the typical way in which a company would interact with, say, analyst is we would have these precise goals, and then we go after them. And then when we're not going to get them, we would say things that we could have said on this call, like almost 40% of our business is outside of America. Every single one of those contracts is being impacted by dollars. Obviously, it's not just that people are paying us in local currency. If you're paying us in dollars, which many of them are, you've de facto paying 20 sometimes more percent more that we can't capture on our balance sheet and can't show to you. Those things are impacting our business. I would say the primary impact to our business, though, is actually positive. It's -- U.S. adapts when things are bad, and it adapts very quickly. I spent a lot of my life in Europe. Europe does not adapt as quickly. And so what we're really seeing is America adapting to what we believed 5 years ago was the product of the future and buying it at -- like at a very anomalous way and beginning at scale. So we're not talking $50 million to $100 million. We're now talking $350 million, $400 million to $650 million, $750 million. So we're seeing the doom and gloom that is a blight on society, how everyone wants to call it, both economic and political and quite frankly, the fact that legitimacy in our leaders is so embarrassingly low, it's hard to solve problems that we're seeing that negatively impact the business outside of America, particularly in Europe because people are entrenched and slower on the tech acquisition side and very, very positively accelerating our business. We're seeing it in commercial, we believe, in government. And we're -- yes. Unidentified Company Representative : Great. Thank you, Alex. Our next question comes from Sanjit at Morgan Stanley. Sanjit Singh : Alex, I wanted to get your view, not so much on the quarter, but sort of the longer-term framework. I noticed that you guys didn't reiterate the 30% outlook. And some sense, that makes sense because deals are uncertain. But I thought it was interesting that you guys took back the 30%, which made it seem that some of the issues that you're seeing in terms of contract, I'm sorry, were you able to hear the question, Alex -- Alex Karp : No, I hear you. I was hoping to see you as well, but it's okay. Keep going. I have the gist of the contract -- of the question. Sanjit Singh : Got it. So I think you know where I'm going at this with some of the contract -- Alex Karp : I am driving the company to get to $4.5 billion in 2025. I believe in driving the company that way. And I do not believe -- what I believe is that the future on USG and by the way, IG is likely to be at parity with the last decade for both macro reasons and because we simply have products that we built that were not deployed because they were basically they\u2019re war time products. So you have MetaConstellation, Nexus Peering and other products that de facto are not that useful unless you're at war. Then you have the Foundry uses, the use of Foundry in the Defense Department and another that get usage, but not the way they should, both on -- for all sorts of issues that are also in civilian. And then you have PG. And the fusing of PG and Foundry was particularly useful, but you have to understand it. So I believe that we will get to the 2025 goal. I tend to view the business the way I view our most important segment of the business, which is there will be ups and downs. Again, the 10-year CAGR on USG is 35%. Unidentified Company Representative : Thanks, Alex. Our next question comes from Mariana with Bank of America. Mariana, please turn on your camera and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Mariana Perez Mora : Good morning, everyone. Can you hear? Alex Karp : Yes, we can hear you. Mariana Perez Mora : So my question is a follow-up on the U.S. government contracting environment. You mentioned it is still trading. I think most of the defense services company is the same. However, what I'd like to hear from you is like have you seen any change from the customer approach and the traditional approach to data rights given the urgency today to adopt new technologies? Alex Karp : Well, first of all, the -- again, our frustration is built on the fact that we have a very large integral. So it's like, of course, we see smaller things accelerating. But to grow off of from last year\u2019s 670 base and up into where we should grow requires very large contracts over many, many years. By the way, orthogonal to your question is not exactly what you're asking. Part of our strategy is that we are going to grow commercial to be so big and so linear, and that \u2013 especially starting in the U.S. that, in fact, these vicissitudes are just less important. What you're seeing in our business now is the largest part of our business is subject to contracting. That actually is going to shift. The U.S. business, I mean, even without doing FX currency, which I've been told everybody on the planet is doing, and I don't want to do, our European business is still growing at almost 20%. That's without FX adjustment. So then if you look at our business, which continues to just in America, again, because of this adaptation in America and a willingness to embrace things that didn't make sense 2 years ago that now makes sense now, that you're looking at a business where the vicissitudes are just less important. On the general political thing, what can the West do? Of course, I mean -- but we are just in a situation in the West, where we have the most interesting noble and virtuous societies and there is a real dearth in operational leadership. We could save money in the U.S. government by going around saying, \"Look, we will contract quicker, but you get paid less.\" That would be obviously good for everyone. That's unlikely to happen. And so what we're doing is building our business so it's less important and trying to get better at both forecasting how this will happen and getting locked into bigger and bigger and bigger contracts. But this will be an ongoing issue for Palantir. We believe the severity of it will be less every year simply because of the strength of the U.S. and later, the handoff function in Europe on our commercial sales. Unidentified Company Representative : Thanks, Alex. Our next question comes from Brad at Deutsche Bank. Brad, please turn on your camera, and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Brad Zelnick : Great. Can you guys see me? Alex Karp : No. But we're rolling here. You can just -- we'll do it without the -- Brad Zelnick : With no audio -- Alex Karp : Yes. We got the audio. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. I wanted to ask about partnerships, which you've spoken about in recent quarters, particularly with government contractors and other providers to USG and global governments. What proof points are there that support your confidence that these traditional providers to government are choosing to bid on business with Palantir versus maybe coming up with their own reusable IP that qualifies for meeting the requirements of the far and streamlined government -- Alex Karp : I'll let Shyam dig into the specifics. It is my belief that this space does not have comparable providers of software. I do not believe there's a single provider in the world that can produce our software. But they can produce things on top of our software that we can't produce. And I don't think this is a marriage of love. I think this is a marriage of necessity. Honestly, if they could build the software we built, they would not partner with us. If we could build the hardware products they built or quite frankly, navigate some of the both American and international networks that they can navigate there, we wouldn't partner with them. Now the specifics, Shyam is very much on top of. Shyam Sankar : Yes, absolutely. So we are opening a large pipeline with partners that are built on this integrated hardware software offering. There are a lot of places where we're the prime, and they're partnering with us, deliver on this. That's led to a lot of productive collaboration that's brought opportunities within the 5 eyes and the U.S. more broadly, where they're the prime and we -- our software can be a key differentiator going faster. There's also a maturity aspect of this where to Alex's point, they've tried to build this offer that we have and have failed. And that takes 5 years or longer. And so many of them are coming up to the point where they realized it would be much better for them as a matter of necessity to partner to go faster. Alex Karp : By the way, on this point, one of the most important things driving our software, but especially in commercial is, is that people have tried and tried and tried to build our product. We have a number of customers that we've been able to bring on board this year that, quite frankly, didn't like us. And it's like -- but the product brought them back. And why did the product bring them back? Because the product is actually delivering value that is otherwise not available. And you could imagine 2 years ago, you could spend $1 billion instead of spending $20 million on Palantir. A lot of those people have spent $1 billion. And lo and behold, they are bringing -- being brought back to this product often with people that do not inherently want to hang out with us, but the product has brought them back. And in the U.S. government especially, the U.S. government has tried everything not to buy our product. We had to sue the U.S. government twice. Just imagine how popular I am. They still are buying the product. It's not a love relationship always. It's -- we bring you back. Our products bring you back. Once you've used Foundry for whatever, all the use cases we talked about, you usee Nexus Peering, powering -- by powering GAIA and Foundry to bring yourself home alive, you're not eager to not come home alive. And you will buy the product that actually delivers that even if the person who's nominally or is actually in charge is unlikable to you. Unidentified Company Representative : Thanks, Alex and Shyam. Alex, we've had a lot of individual investors to make questions. Is there anything you'd like to say before we end the call? Alex Karp : We at Palantir are individual investors. I really, really -- there are a lot of motivations for fighting to win. Most of them are, I believe, the West needs people fighting for it. I think you know we're uniquely positioned. I have great reverence for the people at Palantir. But one of the really big motivations for me personally are individual investors. I have a lot of respect for the time you take. Whenever I read reviews of Palantir, the person has actually used the product. By the way, we're going to begin to talk to institutional investors, but our primary way we're going to do it is use our product. One of the largest, most important institutional investors -- is we're engaging with, and use our product first, and then we'll discuss whether it's differentiated, the unit economics, the margin numbers, all these things. But it all flows from do you believe the product is actually differentiated? Are these products the best in the world? Can Microsoft, Oracle, Amazon, Google replace these products quickly? Those are the kind of questions. And the people who spend the most time on those questions are individual investors, and now you have a lot of respect for that. And you're one of the many reasons that we fight. Unidentified Company Representative : Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Welcome to Palantir's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued prior to the market open and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our third quarter and fiscal 2022 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed prior to market open today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Operating Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; Ryan Taylor, Chief Business Affairs and Legal Officer; and Kevin Kawasaki, Global Head of Business Development. To begin today's call, we'll open with a few highlights from Foundry Con, where you'll hear from Alex as well as representatives from Jacobs, Tyson Foods, William, Apache, Swiss Re and Space Systems Command. [Audio/Video Presentation] Operator : I'll now turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan Taylor : We generated $478 million in revenue this past quarter and $37 million in adjusted free cash flow, marking our eighth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted free cash flow. Despite significant geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, our government business surpassed the $1 billion revenue mark on a trailing 12-month basis, and our U.S. commercial business grew for the ninth quarter in a row, rising 53% year-over-year. The number of customers using our software, including leading commercial and government enterprises in the U.S. and overseas also increased substantially this past quarter, rising 66% from this time last year. We increased our U.S. commercial customer count to 132 at the end of Q3, a 124% increase year-over-year. Our expanded footprint within the market is a reflection of our ability to both reach additional customers and grow existing relationships. In particular, we closed 273 deals this past quarter representing an increase of 63% year-over-year. 19 of those deals were at least $10 million in total contract value, 32 were at least 5 million and 78 were at least 1 million. We have come as far as we have by consistently engaging with some of the hardest problems that the world and our customers have faced since our founding. For example, our work in supply chains, which is increasingly scaling into ecosystems is powered by foundry's data integration capabilities. This year alone, we have started 25 supply chain projects. This includes the expansion of our work in shipbuilding at Hyundai Heavy Industries bringing the partnership to over 45 million and the expansion of our work with the FDA to modernize food supply resilience to preclude shortages like the one we experienced with infant formula earlier this year. The total value of contracts that we have closed in the third quarter reached 1.3 billion, a new milestone for us, which includes nearly $1 billion of contract awards from the U.S. government alone such as our most recent contract worth up to 229 million with the U.S. Army Research Lab to deliver AI ML capabilities across the DoD. We recognize that our path to growth is not always linear, but with the opportunity that lies ahead, we continue to recruit and retain the top talent at a time when other companies in the technology sector are slashing their plans and cutting workforces. I'll hand it over to Shyam for further discussion regarding our business and product strategy moving forward. Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Ryan. We have spent the last 2 decades building our products for the world in which we actually live. The disruption and uncertainty that we're seeing around us from Ukraine, the pandemic and inflation, it's driving customers towards us and to our software. As the world continues to struggle with concurrent supply chain and energy crises, Palantir customers have been able to use foundry to connect and integrate decision-making within their value chain, from their suppliers to their customers to instantly trade off possible courses of action. You just saw highlights from 2 flagship events we held in Palo Alto and London for our customers to share their experiences with each other. Customers underscored the significant impact our software is having across industries. Executives at Tyson Foods shared how they generated $200 million of annualized savings in 24 months. Jacobs Engineering shared how our software has reduced energy consumption by 1/5 at its first wastewater plant running on foundry, with the potential to generate $90 million of annualized savings across their 300 plants. Swiss Re shared that they saved more than $100 million in the first year of use alone. More than 35% of employees at Swiss Re use our software on a regular basis. Our - moment of macroeconomic uncertainty, that differentiation has never been more valuable to the market than today. These customers consistently focus on our ontology as the decisive factor in delivering results quickly. Our strength, particularly in the U.S. commercial market has also received increasing recognition across the industry. Gartner ranked us as a visionary in data integration. IDC ranked Palantir as the #1 AI software platform worldwide by 2021 market share and sales, beating Microsoft, IBM, Amazon and Google. Forrester named Palantir as the leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning platforms. And there is no place where time to kinetic impact is more important than on the battlefield. In the government sector, Gotham has become the choice for U.S. and allied defense organizations around the world. We have now officially received DoD IL-6 accreditation, a critical milestone for our broader government business, further enabling our SaaS offering on secret networks. And our new Fed start offering builds on Apollo to enable software companies to achieve FedRAMP authorization in record time and at a fraction of the cost. In addition, we had our TITAN vehicle on display at the annual AUSA conference, where it was met with positive reactions from the U.S. government, partner nations and the industrial base. From the kill chain to the supply chain, our products ensure that there are no missing links. I'll turn it over to Dave to take us through the financial results from this quarter. David Glazer : Our U.S. business continues to be the most significant driver of our growth. U.S. revenue grew 31% year-over-year to 297 million, and on a trailing 12-month basis, U. S. revenue grew to $1.11 billion. Our commercial revenue in the United States grew 53% year-over-year to $88 million, and our core U.S. commercial revenue, which excludes our strategic investment program, grew 47% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. U.S. government revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $209 million. On customer count, our net new U.S. commercial customers grew 124% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter, marking 7 consecutive quarters of sequential growth greater than 10%. Turning to our global top line results. Third quarter total revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $478 million, ahead of our prior guidance even when factoring in an additional $1. 4 million currency headwind since we issued guidance. Overall net dollar retention was 119% remaining constant quarter-over-quarter. Commercial revenue increased 17% year-over-year to $204 million. Our international commercial business was roughly flat year-over-year and continues to be affected by both macroeconomic conditions and the strengthening dollar. A number of our customers in the United Kingdom, Europe and Asia enter into contracts denominated in U.S. dollars. And as a result, the strong dollar has been a significant headwind for them. Government revenue increased 26% year-over-year to $274 million. We saw our government business cross another major milestone this quarter as we generated $1.02 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time. Our customer count continues to increase at a significant rate. We added 33 net new customers in the third quarter, bringing our Q3 2022 customer count to 337, a 66% increase year-over-year and an 11% sequential increase. We added 25 net new commercial customers, which represents 98% growth year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. Our revenue within our existing customers also continues to expand. Trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 15% year-over-year to $48 million per customer. Third quarter billings were $509 million, up 47% year-over-year. In the third quarter, total contract value or TCV was 1.3 billion. U.S. TCV booked was $1.1 billion, 90% of which was attributable to our U.S. government business. The third quarter TCV figure was driven significantly by renewals and expansions of existing U.S. government contracts, a portion of which have already been funded to date. For total remaining deal value, we ended the third quarter with $4.1 billion a 17% increase quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter growth in total remaining deal value was driven by our unusually strong performance in TCV. As I previously mentioned, the TCV of our U.S. government contracts accounts for both funded and unfunded contract value, and we're seeing this pass-through to our total remaining deal value. We saw headwinds to remaining deal value as a result of executing on our previously announced plan to cancel all remaining unfunded strategic investment commitments. We ended the third quarter with $1.3 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 43% year-over-year. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in our government business. Turning to margins and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 80%. Third quarter adjusted expenses were $397 million, up 9% sequentially. The sequential increase was driven primarily by headcount-related expense as we had 450 net headcount additions in the quarter, our largest hiring quarter of the year, and including 141 new graduates who joined in quarter. Third quarter adjusted income from operations, excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes was $81 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 17%, 600 basis points ahead of our prior guidance. Our adjusted operating margin significantly exceeded our guidance as a result of several factors, but primarily driven by cloud and deployment efficiencies representing around $9 million of outperformance, and the elimination of certain discretionary spend across the business, particularly in G&A, representing approximately $14 million of outperformance. We expect to continue to see efficiencies in the fourth quarter, and we'll remain disciplined in our approach to the discretionary spend in this macroeconomic environment. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.01, which includes a negative $0.02 impact driven by losses on marketable securities. We generated $47 million in cash from operations and our adjusted free cash flow was $37 million, representing a margin of 10% and 8%, respectively. This marks our eighth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted free cash flow. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated 231 million in adjusted free cash flow and $238 million in cash flow from operations. We ended the third quarter with $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. We retain access to additional liquidity of up to $950 million through our $500 million revolving credit facility and $450 million delayed draw term loan facility, both of which remain entirely undrawn. Our balance sheet leaves us well positioned to capitalize on opportunities that may arise in the current macro environment. Now turning to our outlook, for the full year 2022, despite a negative $6 million currency impact since our prior quarter's guidance, we are reaffirming our revenue guidance of between $1.9 billion and $1.902 billion. Excluding such impact, we would expect full year 2022 revenue of between $1.906 billion and $1.908 billion. We are raising our outlook for adjusted income from operations for the full year. We now expect adjusted income from operations of between $384 million and $386 million. For the fourth quarter, after factoring in a negative $5 million currency impact since our prior quarter's guidance, we expect revenue of between $503 million and $505 million. Excluding such impact, we would expect fourth quarter revenue of between $508 million and $510 million. We expect adjusted income from operations of $78 million to $80 million. With that, I'll turn it over to Ana to start the Q&A. A - Unidentified Company Representative : Thanks, Dave. We'll begin with 2 questions from our shareholders before we open up the call. Our first question comes from Ryan who asks, can you speak about the current competitive landscape and elaborate how Palantir products stand out against the newly launched Microsoft data platform, Salesforce Genie and the Snowflake platform that are attempting to offer an all-in-one solution like foundry? Ryan Taylor : Shyam, do you want to take this? Shyam Sankar : Sure. Well, thanks, Ryan. The answer is really the ontology. It's why our platforms remain far ahead of the competition. And that's because the ontology, it's the missing link in terms of what you need to realize value from all of these investments. It's the component and the architecture that's required to get data apps to actually deliver value on top of cloud data warehouses or to get AI to scale throughout the enterprise or to turn your digital twin into something that's actionable and operational within the enterprise. And we've spent 15 years investing in a road map that's deep and built upon the ontology, and it continues to be the focus of all the core investments that we're making around product. We're deepening the capability that we're offering our customers here. And that's happening against the backdrop where the competition has yet to understand what the ontology really is, but they will. And that's really my main conclusion from our foundry con events in Palo Alto and London is that our customers were so clearly articulating the role of the ontology, the value they credited it as really the decisive factor in delivering results quickly. And there are 2 things there that should not be taken for granted results that are quick. And so that's, I think, a key focus here. You heard from Deutsche Telekom, they talked about how they don't even bother connecting to data sources that won't be modeled in the ontology because they see so much value in a reduced effort and increased outcome for the use cases that they're able to build on top of the ontology. We heard that from Rio Tinto, where they talked about at the Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia, how they actually originally modeled risk in operations. But because they did in ontology for free, they got an opportunity data set that helped them drive increased production, which is obviously the front end of the business there. In Palo Alto, we heard from Tyson's Food where they were able to use the ontology to quickly go from an initial use case around COVID response to a set of use cases that got to $10 million of value and then quickly to $40 million and then finally to $200 million worth of value. Alexander Karp : Just a slightly different augmentation of what Shyam is saying, maybe a different riff that like underscores the success of people using our product is people think these products are easy to build. And by the way -- and this is whether it was PG, Nexus peering, GAIA, or foundry, foundry one, data integration, foundry 2, kind of ontology decisions driven, a lot of people, even at big otherwise successful companies go from PowerPoint to thin technology under the assumption, you can just take ontology, you can spell it slightly differently, you can spell it the same way, and you can impose it on your, honestly, not very strong software offering that was last year's technology with this year's salespeople. And it doesn't work. That's why we are powering the USG. That is why we are powering [war] (ph) efforts. That's why foundry was used in, to save, probably 500,000 lives in America. Mostly people who are from the under class and would have died during COVID. And it's why we need our competition to explain to the world, okay, you need this. But they gravely underestimate the difficulty in doing this. We've been doing this for 15 years. There are thousands of hidden problems that really I don't think any other company understands, whether it's the cold chain, the supply chain. It's like -- and it's wonderful that people are discovering this. It's going to take decades to build this stuff. Even if you can build it as well as we can. You have to discover the problems. And that's why our clients on the evangelism tour, primarily in the U.S., are galvanizing the market and leading to these results. But the difficulty is just completely underestimated. Unidentified Company Representative : Thank you, Shyam and Alex. Our next question comes from Garrad who asks what are Palantir's plans to grow the business in this challenging macro environment. Alexander Karp : I mean other people should -- we've been predicting an even more challenging macro environment than this for the last 20 years. I mean how long have we been in the trenches together? 17 years in the trenches. The products are built for a disjointed world, a world where you need horizontal and vertical integration in the military context or actually we have low latency where your systems -- underlying systems actually don't work even though on the PowerPoint, they say they do, where you have to deliver results overnight, where your business totally f-ed and you got to make it work in a quarter. That's what our business is built for. By the way, that's why we prepared and then that's the technical thing. Why do we have 8 quarters of free cash flow? Do you think it's a coincidence, we were preparing for this. We have -- why do we have $2.4 billion in the bank and no debt? We weren't living in the metasphere. We were living in this world in the way we thought it would be -- and we've been essentially -- you could even look at this as a prep. We're a prepper company. We've been preparing it's like -- preppers have their rucksack and a rifle. We have PG, GAIA, Foundry and $2.4 billion in the bank and no debt. That's our company. Unidentified Company Representative : Our next question is from Brent with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Dr. Karp on the government business at the beginning of the year, you had a bigger aspiration for deals to come into the pipeline. I think you brought a close assumption down. I'm curious where you see the pipeline of the government transactions for the back half of this year into '23. Alexander Karp : It was a little bit -- okay, breaking up, but I think you were saying, well, where do we see the government revenue going. Look, we're positing to the world purely financially. Palantir's had a CAGR of 35% in the USG. It's -- that CAGR is included years, I think, 3 years that were flat. So we tend to have kind of lumpy growth and flatness, which no one likes. You don't like it. We don't like it. We're positing that the future will look more like the traditional baseline of 35% than the baseline of this year of upper 20s. What is the proof of that? Okay, I could tell you how our products are being used on the front line. You can read the news, you can probably surmise that things like Nexus peering, foundry, GAIA are powering events that you may be reading about. And then there's our massive TCV. It's like, yes, TCV in the USG is just under $1 billion. This is massive. There's a legitimate question, when do you capture that in the form of GAAP revenue? That's a legitimate question to which we have no answer. But we will capture it because the contracts have been concluded and because we are sitting on the most important missions in the world, and those missions are going to end up being fully funded, and you see that in our contractual relationships. Unidentified Company Representative : Thanks, Alex. Our next question is from Mariana with Bank of America. Mariana Perez Mora : So with increased expectations for global recession next year, I understand it's probably too early to discuss specifics about 2023 outlook. But would you mind discussing how you're thinking about the positive and negative catalyst from a global recession or a potential global recession? Because I think -- the way I think about it is it's a positive catalyst for disruption and increased needs for operational efficiencies and for Palantir demand, but also probably lower corporate profits are challenged. So how are you thinking about that? Alexander Karp : We disambiguate the world into America, Canada, U.K. and then what has historically been a very large market for us. Europe, driven by Germany. What I think you see happening is that disruption is helping us in the U.S. It's driving results that are outsized in U.S. commercial. Our LTM in the last 12 months is $327 million, roughly, 102% growth. You see the TCV number in USG. You can surmise what that means. So and then the positive side of it is that the integral of U.S. revenue for us is growing at 61%. It used to be 49% 2 years ago. It will be in the 70% range fairly shortly. And so the impact of the disruption is much greater/disruptive negative effect of Europe, especially sluggishness in Europe's motor Germany will impact us less. However, what I believe and other people should talk about is that we are going to see negative impacts because of strong dollar because of sluggishness to adopt new technologies in Europe that will impact our business. It is impacting our business. If you took those results, the LTM for our U.S. business is still just under 40%. And so if you took out our European market, this would be -- I mean, obviously, results are strong, but they would be flying in like a -- and those are going to impinge us. They're going to continue to impinge us. It's just the amount of impinging is going to be less. I do think it's particularly dangerous for most people in tech. This environment is not in an environment where flimsy thin, non-valuable essentially, you churn your data and you show our PowerPoint to somebody who barely understands that technology is going to work just because you've got a great steak dinner and white teeth. That's not going to work. And Americans still expect a lot more than that, both in government and in commercial. Now the rest of the world may not expect more than that. And that's a problem for the rest of the world long term and a problem for us in the near term. But yes, we see this as a huge opportunity also both because other people will fail and will succeed. Shyam Sankar : I don't know what look, disruption has always been a huge opportunity for us. I think that's exactly right. And those geographies are where we're focused. Unidentified Company Representative : Our next question is from Gabriela with Goldman Sachs. Gabriela Borges : We appreciate the case studies at foundry con about the tens of millions of savings that some of your customers are realizing. So 2 questions on my end. One is, how are you thinking about evolving the pricing model towards a value-based pricing give us an update on how you're thinking about capturing the upside from value-based pricing while also giving your customers flexibility with their initial price points? And then the second question is for deployed engineering model, how is that evolving as you start low commercial value customers on the ACV side? Does that essentially shift your mix away from the forward deployed engineering model over time? Shyam Sankar : Yes. So on the pricing side, I mean, value-based pricing is where we started. That's kind of our jam, so to speak. And I think what we've had to evolve over time is pricing models like usage-based pricing that enable enterprise customers to start on smaller use cases, nibble into it, kind of figure out where it's going to fit in their enterprise come experientially to realize the power that the oncology unlocks and then scale that across their operations. And you can kind of see that playing out in the case studies where Tyson starts with COVID response and then scale at S&OP plus, plus, plus. Like from a small use case to the breadth of the enterprise here, and that's been very helpful for us. And then we have customers who kind of migrate models from usage-based to large enterprise contracts as they go. And I think really for us, it's been showing the flexibility to meet the customer where they're at. In terms of our forward deployed engineering models, like our -- I really think about that as much more in terms of R&D from our shoes. Like how many people are spending time at the coal phase asking the hard question of is my software working? And I don't mean does it work as in like, is there an room, is there a bug, I mean like, does it effing matter to this institution? And in this time of immense macroeconomic challenge, like am I saving the institution? Am I doing anything that's going to move the needle, or is my little churning the data, just moving deck tiers on the Titanic. And those are the people who actually have that sensibility. And they're the ones that come up with the idea of what are we going to build next? What can we do now? How do we inflect the product road map so it matters? And so we're always going to modulate how we deploy those folks between USG things that are happening in Europe, things that are happening at the front lines of our customers' operations. The engineers are looking and seeing what we're doing on -- in large-scale mining operations in Mongolia as it relates to driving our R&D road map forward. Unidentified Company Representative : Alex, we had a lot of individual investors on the line who submitted questions. Is there anything you'd like to say before we end the call? Alexander Karp : You know, we built this company for really tough times. The times are tough and they're going to get worse. We feel that Palantir, we know Palantir shines whether it's in the anti-terror context, the war context, the COVID context, or the U. S. commercial context when times are bad. This is a long-term play. We are watching our products and how they're absorbed in the market. And I really appreciate your support. Our individual investors mean a lot to us and to me. And we are planning to continue to go into battle every day. We are living in this world, not in some meta fake world that you may enjoy until you wake up and you are poorer, your brain works less well and you hate your neighbor. We are the size and depth and quality of our revenues matter to us and to you. We believe we are making the West a stronger and better country. We see in America an ability to adapt like no other country, to be open to people who present things in the ways that look [expletive] crazy, and if they work, they don't really care and they give you an ability to buy in. We celebrate that. We are enormously proud of our work defending the West, especially the U.S. military and its allies. I wish I could tell you more about what we're doing and how much it's transforming the world to be a better place. How much it scares our adversaries. What we deliver scares our adversaries; how much we were underestimated by our adversaries because of the informational technology and products we built over decades. The quality of the people we have here, the pain we go through to deliver and our commitment to win. Unidentified Company Representative : Thank you, Alex. That concludes today's call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ana Soro : Good afternoon. I'm Ana Soro from Palantir's finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market closed and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our first quarter and fiscal 2023 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which would cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures, is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons, unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. You'll also be hearing from Shyam Sankar, our Chief Technology Officer, who prepared a few remarks, who could not join today's call as he's on the front lines with one of our customers. I'll now turn it over to Alex for opening remarks. Alex Karp : At Palantir, we have a tradition of talking about macro events philosophy. There would be a lot to talk about this year. I think for the first time, people have seen the impact of digitization of warfare and Palantir's central role in the world. Leaving aside this, and I would love to talk more about it in the context of our earnings call, in the context of our interactions with the broader world, the transformations on the outside of the world brought to you by Palantir seem to be equally big on the inside. Palantir, for the first time, is GAAP profitable. I, in most of my discussions, talk about product, talk about product market fit, occasionally talk about revenue. And I'm often asked, well, if it's so good, why aren't you GAAP profitable? We promised you GAAP profitability in 2025, which you thought would be in 2027 perhaps. We are now, in the last quarter GAAP profitable, and we plan to be GAAP profitable in this year. Obviously, there's a lot of questions around that, like how did we become GAAP profitable several years before anyone expected? What does it mean for our business? What does it mean that seemingly no tech company ever becomes GAAP profitable? Why is our company profitable? What sectors of the Company made it profitable? But for those of you who have been long-term supporters or even watchers of Palantir, the move from a company that was producing the most important products in the world to a company that is doing that in a profitable context is enormous, perhaps as big as our DPO. And we're proud of this because it gives us the strength and power to continue our march to support the world's most institutions -- important institutions. Thank you. Ryan Taylor : As Alex highlighted, our company, after nearly two decades, achieved GAAP profitability for the first time last quarter. Our focus has been on building one of the most significant and durable software companies in the world. And our first profitable quarter after years of investment in our business represents the beginning of a new chapter in our company's history. In Q4 2022, we generated $509 million in revenue, and we generated $79 million in cash from operations, marking our eighth consecutive quarter of positive cash from operations. While the technology industry as a whole has been facing one of the most challenging operating environments in years, we continue to deliver on our top line and bottom line results, in particular, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin. Our commercial business generated $215 million of revenue last quarter. While our U.S. commercial business slowed in the fourth quarter as a result of catch-up revenue in the prior quarter and contracting revenue from customers in our strategic investment program, we remain confident about our momentum and the opportunities ahead. We ended the quarter with 143 U.S. commercial customers, an increase of 79% year-over-year, and converted 13 pilots the most in quarter to date set up our U.S. commercial business to reaccelerate in 2023. We are deploying increasingly focused go-to-market strategies, including in the health care, supply chain, manufacturing, energy, automotive and utility sectors. The number of deals closed in health care more than doubled in the last year. We recently signed with several of the nation's largest hospital systems, including Cleveland Clinic, Tampa General and one of the oldest teaching hospitals. Our momentum continues this year, having recently signed a deal with an American for-profit operator of over 2,400 health care sites. Together, these four hospital systems represent nearly 10% of the entire hospital system in the United States. In the supply chain sector, we began work at two of the largest Coca-Cola bottlers and distributors in both the U.S. and the EMEA region. And we were called into Toyota Material Handling, a forklift manufacturer and distributor, after executives learned of our comparable supply chain work at Komatsu. Cardinal Health also recently began using Foundry to deploy AI and ML to combine diagnosis and clinical data with real-time customer purchasing and consumption data for pharmaceutical products. Our international commercial business grew 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, including a multimillion dollar long-term strategic partnership with Crisis24, a GardaWorld company, to deliver data-driven security and risk management, and a $50 million five-year expansion of our work with SOMPO Holdings, where Foundry is helping to improve security, health and well-being through digital transformation. Our government business overall saw growth across the board as well as we generated $293 million in revenue this past quarter, an increase of 23% year-over-year. Our U.S. government business saw continued growth in Q4, up 22% year-over-year, which reflects the strong contract activity in Q3. Likewise, our international government business was up 26% year-over-year, including the expansion of our work supporting pressing global events as well as the signing of Palantir's enterprise agreement with Defence Digital, a consolidated effort on the part of the British military to modernize its software systems. With the value of up to GBP75 million, we expect this agreement to further accelerate the growth of partnerships with defense and intelligence customers across the United Kingdom as well as our U.K. government business overall. This quarter's GAAP profitability illustrates our commitment to fiscal responsibility through management and margins while expanding our business. We acknowledge the challenges ahead and remain strongly poised for long-term growth. I'll now turn it over to Shyam. Shyam Sankar : In 2022, our software foiled a plot to overthrow the German government, delivered $200 million of return to Tyson Foods, empowered companies through the energy crisis. Our momentum stems from the fact that we have built software that actually works, not software that's easier to sell. We publicly announced Foundry 23 at Foundry Con 2 weeks ago. The cornerstone of our product vision is that your business is computable. But just because it's computable doesn't mean you know how to compute it. This requires an ontology. Ontology is link human insight with programmable controls, enabling your people to compute the parts of your business that really matter. For example, Tyson Foods implemented a model that determines the optimal allocation of inventories to trucks and distribution centers and automatically decisions that by calling back into their ERP systems, the ontology's Webhooks. This work among the 20 use cases Tyson's delivers in Foundry, delivered $200 million of value for them. Upgrading to S4 doesn't do this. It doesn't make your business better. Your planning tools and pricing platforms don't talk to each other. ERP and MES systems don't talk to each other. So employees escape to Excel sheets, and business logic is scattered across systems. That makes your business hard to understand and harder yet to change or improve. Our customers need software to connect and orchestrate their existing systems. Your business is computable. You need Foundry to compute it. This view and a focus on our ontology is driving our product developments through 2023. Turning to Apollo. Just because you know how to compute parts of your business doesn't mean it's valuable. You need to complete the cycle of development, deployment and learning. Not only do you have to be able to push your logic out to the edge to the factory floor, to every connected node in your business you need to be able to do it repeatedly. As technology companies seek to aggressively reduce cloud costs and eliminate DevOps headcount, Apollo provides the critical technology enabler that solves not only the CTO's problem, but also the CFO's problem. We're also continuing to see traction with Fed Start, our Apollo-based offering, which enables customers to achieve FedRAMP authorization in record time and at a fraction of the cost while still reducing DevOps cost. From the Middle Eastern, the Pacific and European theaters, Gotham is today the AI-driven operating system for defense. Recent events have already proven the superiority of Gotham and AI-driven target detection and development. In 2023, we are focused on the continued development of Gotham against both targeting and fires across all domains from space to mud. A forward deployed O-3 recently wrote a python model using Gotham software development kit for JADC2 in three hours to upgrade his units targeting and fires operation, a step change versus what was possible before. We're proud of and thankful for the privilege of supporting this mission set. I'll pass it to Dave to take us through the financials. Dave Glazer : The fourth quarter of 2022 was a milestone quarter for us. For the first time in the Company's history, we've achieved GAAP profitability. This was driven by our top line and bottom line outperformance, our continued management of stock-based compensation and fiscal discipline, the narrowing of losses from marketable securities and a gain from the acquisition of our Palantir Japan joint venture. On the back of that strength, we expect full year 2023 to be our first full year of GAAP profitability several years ahead of our original goal of GAAP profitability in 2025. Turning to our global top line results. We generated $1.91 billion in revenue in 2022, representing a growth rate of 24% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated $509 million in revenue, up 18% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. We generated $1.16 billion in total U.S. revenue in 2022, representing a growth rate of 32% over the year ago period. In the fourth quarter of 2022, U.S. revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $302 million. Overall, net dollar retention was 115%. Customer count grew 55% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter. Revenue from our existing customers continues to expand. Fourth quarter trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 13% year-over-year to $49 million per customer. Now moving on to our commercial segment. In 2022, our overall commercial revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $834 million. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our commercial revenue grew 11% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Commercial revenue from strategic investment contracts was $20 million in the fourth quarter. We anticipate commercial revenue from these customers to be between $15 million to $17 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $39 million in the first quarter of 2022. Our full year U.S. commercial revenue grew 67% year-over-year to $335 million. In the fourth quarter of 2022, U.S. commercial revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $77 million but was down sequentially as we saw headwinds from catch-up revenue in the prior quarter as well as a decline of revenue from customers in our strategic investment program given the outsized impact of the macro environment on these customers. Our U.S. commercial customer count grew 79% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of sequential growth. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our international commercial business grew 11% year-over-year and 19% sequentially driven by new deals in APAC, Canada and Europe. Turning to our government segment. In 2022, our government business grew 19% year-over-year to $1.07 billion. And in the fourth quarter of 2022, our government business grew 23% year-over-year to $293 million. We generated $826 million in U.S. government revenue in 2022, representing a growth rate of 22% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated $225 million in U.S. government revenue, representing a growth rate of 22% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. The sequential growth was driven by the commencement of certain U.S. government deals we announced last quarter. Fourth quarter billings were $387 million. Full year billings were $1.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year. TCV booked in the fourth quarter was $392 million. Full year TCV bookings was $2.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year. We ended 2022 with $3.7 billion in total remaining deal value and $973 million in remaining performance obligations. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in our government business. Both remaining deal value and remaining performance obligations faced headwinds from the macroeconomic impact on customers from the strategic investment program. As a result, the total remaining deal value and the total value of our commercial contracts from our strategic investment program was down $262 million since last quarter as we continue to review the financial condition of these businesses. We'll continue to monitor the impact as the year progresses. Turning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 81% for the year and 82% for the quarter. Full year 2022 adjusted expenses, when excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, were $1.5 billion. Fourth quarter adjusted expenses were $394 million, down roughly 1% sequentially, reflecting measures we took in quarter to manage discretionary spending and our focus on efficiencies. Full year 2022 adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, was $421 million. Fourth quarter adjusted income from operations was $114 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 22%, 600 basis points ahead of our prior guidance. The significant beat on our adjusted income from operations guidance was driven by cost savings from our R&D efforts and disciplined spend management as well as moderated net headcount additions in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of 2022 was our strongest GAAP operating income quarter ever as we move closer to breakeven with an operating loss of $18 million. This is a testament to our disciplined spending amid the macro uncertainty as well as the normalization of our stock-based compensation expense overhang since becoming a public company. Stock-based compensation expense was down $38 million in the fourth quarter compared to the year ago period and down $213 million compared to the year ago period. As we look ahead to 2023, we will continue to exercise spend discipline across the Company, pace hiring while continuing to invest in high priority areas, including in our product offerings, building out our go-to-market strategy and technical roles. In addition to GAAP profitability for full year 2023, we anticipate improvement in our GAAP operating income margins over the course of the year. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $31 million. This was a result of a strong GAAP operating quarter in addition to $13 million of investment income from our balance sheet, narrowing of losses on marketable securities to $11 million and a $44 million gain from the acquisition of our Palantir Japan joint venture. But it's not just our GAAP profitability and operating performance that I'm excited about. Our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin was 40% in the fourth quarter and 46% in full year 2022, our third consecutive full year in excess of the Rule of 40 and a score that we will continue to strive to achieve throughout 2023. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $0.06, and GAAP earnings per share was negative $0.18. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.04, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.01, marking our first quarter of positive GAAP EPS. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated $79 million in cash from operations, representing a margin of 15% and our eighth consecutive quarter of positive cash from operations. For the full year 2022, we generated $224 million in cash flow from operations, representing a 12% margin. We ended the fourth quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and no debt. We retain access to additional equity up to $950 million through our $500 million revolving credit facility and $450 million delayed draw term loan facility, both of which remain entirely undrawn. Now turning to our outlook. For Q1 2023, we expect revenue of between $503 million and $507 million and adjusted income from operations of $91 million to $95 million. For full year 2023, we expect revenue of between $2.18 billion and $2.23 billion, adjusted income from operations of between $481 million to $531 million and GAAP net income. Before opening the call up for questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank Jeff Buckley, our outgoing Chief Accounting Officer, for his contributions to Palantir. Jeff has been an incredible leader and a member of our team on the journey from a private company to a public company. We announced a few weeks ago that he'd be stepping down after the filing of our 10-K, and we're grateful that he will be staying on with us after to help with a seamless transition. We're excited to promote Heather Planishek to the role and look forward to continuing to build on both Jeff's and the team's successes. With that, I'll turn it over to Ana to start the Q&A. A - Ana Soro : Thanks, Dave. We'll begin with a few questions from our shareholders before we open up the call. The top questions are related to GAAP profitability, with the number one question from Abraham who asks, when is Palantir going to become profitable? Alex Karp : Well, we're profitable, and we will be profitable this year on a year basis. I think -- because if you look at the questions that come to us and just the questions I get from clients and others, one of the main questions we've gotten in public and in private is, well, we know the products are transformational. We've seen them in the context of anti-terrorism, especially in Europe. We've seen them in the context of pandemic and now in the context of changing the course of history in Eastern Europe. But if it's so powerful and so good, why aren't you profitable? And I think we took this question a lot more seriously than I think people on the outside realize precisely because there are literally thousands and thousands of users and, at this point, countries, that depend on our product for their survival. And while many of us watching this are obviously highly attenuate to share price, the people whose lives depend on our product have been very dependent on us and want to know that our financial stability now and in the future is guaranteed. So this has been much more of a priority to get us to this place. I'm happy that we have long-term supporters and shareholders that are interested in this, and we will continue to be profitable this year. And so, it's just a major achievement for Palantir. I think another reason the question gets asked is because seemingly, no tech companies ever become GAAP profitable. And that does call into question the underlying value of their products. Yes. With that, next question. Ana Soro : Thanks, Alex. We also received a few questions on ChatGPT and AI. How does Palantir differentiate and compete with other AI software solutions and demonstrate the return on investment for potential clients? Alex Karp : There's been a lot of talk about recent events in consumer Internet and OpenAI, and incredible technologies that have been brought to bear. I think the biggest event in digitalization AI is actually on the battlefield. Palantir took over basically nonpublic programs when the rest of Silicon Valley at the time was very interested in not working with the military, potentially also opening offices in adversarial countries. At the time, AI was a joke, and most people purveying it were partially purveying some form of a PowerPoint bordering on fraud. And so we had a lot of thought going into this and spent the last five years building the core infrastructure that you would need to power and train AI algorithms. The proof in the pudding is simply look at events in Eastern Europe. And so every country in the world is looking how to do it. But what's super interesting in the consumer context is the technologies we built that will allow you to do AI in private networks, institutions and enterprises, have precursor technologies that will take other companies four or five years to build. For example, how do you do AI in a regulated context? Look at a lot of our clients, they're almost all regulated in one form or another. Oil and gas is regulated. Hospitals are regulated. Health care is regulated. Manufacturers is regulated. You can't just run an algorithm on a private network the same way you could on a non-regulated public network. And then there's security issues, there's transparency issues. In the war context, how do you know if the AI made the decision? Under what conditions does AI make the decision? Under who is responsible? What is the chain of authority? How do you do it while maintaining security, because some of the people using the product may actually be working for the other side? There's just thousands and thousands of issues here that required years and years of software build, which we are now going to continue to supply to our allies across the world and to our consumer customers. So we're very, very excited about this, excited about the interest and excited about bringing the fight to our adversaries. Ana Soro : Thanks, Alex. We received a few questions on SBC and dilution, including one from Christopher, who asks at what point is Palantir hoping to reduce SBC? Dave Glazer : Thanks, Christopher. We're laser-focused on SBC and we have been the last few years. If you go back to the quarter that we went public, Q3 of 2020, we had $849 million in that quarter of SBC. You go back to Q4 of 2022, just last quarter it was only $129 million. The last six quarters, we've been down sequentially each quarter with our SBC, and 2022 versus 2021 is down 27% year-over-year. Stepping back, the ultimate test around SBC is really like, are you GAAP profitable? And the answer now is yes. It's yes in Q4. And as we look forward to 2023, the answer is yes there as well. Equity overall, we want to make sure that we align our employees and our stockholders. And you sort of see that in the current results, which are all resulting in GAAP profitability. And so we plan to keep that alignment, to push on the top line, improve the margin and to stay GAAP profitable. Ana Soro : Thanks, Dave. This next question is for you, Ryan. Zachary asks, what are Palantir's primary goals for 2023? Ryan Taylor : Thanks, Zachary. We're planning to keep our heads down, keep doing what we've been doing, which means delivering to our customers on their critical missions with an eye towards long-term growth. And what that specifically means is continuing to focus on both top line and bottom line, our revenue growth, adjusted operating margins and delivering on GAAP profitability, as we've laid out. In the U.S. commercial space, we grew 67% year-over-year. As I highlighted earlier, we have a lot of strong indicators of momentum going into this year, and we expect to deliver another landmark year in U.S. commercial. In the U.S. government space, we'll continue doubling down on the backbone of our business, one of our most important customers, which means seeking to accelerate defense, civil and intelligence space. And obviously, there are factors such as whether or not there's a continuing resolution that might affect the timing of that, but our long-term outlook on U.S. government is extremely strong. In the international space, we're looking to grow the defense business outside of the U.S. as our allied countries are looking to deploy the expertise that we've honed over 20 years around the world in the most important missions. We're looking to grow our work in civil. We're particularly excited about health care and keep our momentum in the U.K. government. And all while doing that, we seek to continue to deliver on GAAP profitability. Alex Karp : A different version of that is we will maintain our discipline around GAAP profitability precisely because the world is recognizing our crucial contribution to the West. We see this in war. We see this in the commercial areas. We see this in health care. We see this where people are embracing technology, especially in the U.S., especially around AI, especially around AI with security models, in private networks. And so there's a tethering between our financial discipline and our ability to just continue crushing in the service of what we believe is important, Western institutions and that they survive and thrive better than adversarial institutions. Ana Soro : Thank you, Ryan and Alex. Our next question is from Brent with Jefferies. Brent, please turn on your camera and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Brent Thill : Dr. Karp, as it relates to the government business, I'm curious if you could just give us an update. I think last year, you had mentioned there were a handful of transactions that got pushed and ultimately not exactly sure what happened there, if you could address that? And then secondarily, there was a CNBC reporter that I think you spoke to just had some comments about strategic interest in Palantir. And I'm just curious if you can just recap maybe what that conversation was and just ultimately how you're thinking about current multiples and where things have gone to you at this point. Alex Karp : Taking the second question first. Really, we've been asked -- we were asked -- a number of reporters have asked me and in general, since -- look, you have a general move where in the last five years, enterprise software has moved from being a sales motion to an existential part of the enterprise, whether the enterprises commercial or in government. The war in the Ukraine proves this. I think most commercial entities in America know this. It's not clear that people know this outside of America, but this is a crucial part of your enterprise. It's also pretty clear that we've built proprietary technology that will allow you to do this in private networks in the context of regulated enterprises that is not available anywhere else. And it would take years and years to build. And that just generates a lot of interest in not -- in Palantir in a way that you didn't have before. And so our basic view of Palantir is we are in this to make institutions of the West stronger. We believe we're winning. Because we're winning, I think there's going to be a lot of interest in us in buying our software and potentially in buying us, but we are pretty focused on our product, which is us. So really not thinking about that very much at all. Gratified that there's been speculation all over that people might want to buy us, but that's really irrelevant. Then on government, there's really -- you're asking about the U.S. government. The U.S. government has these continuing resolutions. We have a number of large-scale contracts that are in the works. There's really no update. The only update is with this call is coming from Washington. It's coming from Washington because regulators, people in Congress and people in the military also have seen what's going on. And there's just a different level of interest in what we provide. It's just -- what does that mean year-on-year? I don't know. I do know that the CAGR on our U.S. government has historically been over 30%. And I think there's a debate among people who support us or don't support us whether that's going to be in the future, the future will represent in the past. I would say every time you open the news, you see another thing that makes Palantir more valuable, whether it's wars in the East or balloons over our society. This is a world that is dangerous that needs AI-driven and, in general, software-driven weaponry. And no other company in the world has been focused on this for the last 20 years than we are. And we are also on these programs. So the short version is no news. The long version is I'm very optimistic. Ana Soro : Thanks, Alex. Our next question is from Mariana with Bank of America. Mariana, please turn on your camera and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Mariana Perez Mora : So my question is about the revenue growth into next year. Do you mind describing what are the main drivers that make... Alex Karp : By the way, your -- we lost you. We lost you after what are the main drivers. I think what you're asking is what are the main drivers that will affect us our revenue build this year? Mariana Perez Mora : All right. I don't know if you can still hear me or not. Alex Karp : Sporadically. I'll say -- I don't know if you guys want to say a couple of words on this or do you want me to launch into my... Ryan Taylor : Yes. I think -- thank you. So I think as we highlighted, like momentum in U.S. commercial is strong. We expect it to be a key part of our growth in our business. U.S. government, obviously critical to our business. Now we expect to see more of that coming later in Q2 and second half of the year. And then in the international business, I think it's continued to deliver on the defense-related initiatives that we're working on. I think combined, those will be the key drivers for our... Alex Karp : Maybe a more direct answer or one that is -- roughly 61% of our business comes from the U.S. I think there's a lot of positive indicators that, that will continue to grow. I'm bullish on commercial. I just met with our commercial team. I suspect that will grow north of 40%. There's lots of reasons for that. The main -- despite the fact that we may have a recession, and of course, the recession is severe enough, it will affect our revenue in the U.S. But you see a lot of positive -- our customers went from something like 80 to 143 last year. It's almost 70%, 80% growth. And then in the U.S., we only have 15% of the top 1,000 companies buying our product, which means we have a lot of room for growth. And last and not least, arguably, most importantly, in the U.S., all parts of the enterprise buy our product. So outside the U.S., it's really CEOs forcing business decision for us on the Company, which is historically we sold our product all over the world. Inside the U.S., it's IT people. It's subdivisions, it's CEOs. Really doesn't matter. They buy different parts of the product, and they're friendly to new things, and they've also gone through a cycle of seeing a lot of the enterprise products are just for churning and storing your data that there's not many results, and they're actually very expensive. And people are suspectful of having a compute model and something that gives you a margin. So the U.S., it looks very strong. U.S. government, we've already been asked about. The weakness in our business is just non-U.S. commercial that grew around 12% last year. I think outside the U.S., they're a lot less friendly to new innovations. It's not clear how they'll react to AI, although we can do AI in the context of data protection. You just have a lack of resistivity in parts of Europe to new technology. So the over-under is, the 61% of our business that is strong is growing and will be a larger part of our business. I suspect the macro environment is largely driven by adversarial nations to America will help us. And then international government, I think that's very likely over time to be very strong because the MetaConstellation product looks like the most cost-effective way to defend your country in the world. And our Ukrainian allies are willing to talk about it and see its value. So I see a lot of -- and we're already seeing countries that are on the border of adversaries, being very, very interested in this product. So, the way I would think about this is think of the U.S. -- I think of the U.S. as being strong. International government as being a real possibility and a drag is just the economic and cultural events in Europe, which is still a significant part of our business. So that's the over and under. Ana Soro : Thanks, Alex. Our last question is from Gabriela with Goldman Sachs. Gabriela, please turn on your camera and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Gabriela Borges : Great. A couple of follow-ups on your commercial business. Firstly, could you give us a little detail on how the large deal pipeline is evolving? And as the macro impacting our ability to close any of the deals in the U.S. on large deals specifically? And then secondly, as you think about the mix between large deals and small deals, are you seeing engagement to date from your U.S. customers that are landing potentially smaller quota in the half a million dollar kind of range, are you seeing engagement to date that suggests the path towards your classic kind of $3 million to $5 million opportunity? Ryan Taylor : Great. So I think on the first question, one, we're obviously seeing our largest customers are growing. If you look at the top 20 customers we have, we're seeing growth there. As you see the average customer size is decreasing, and that's in part because of the volume of customers that we're bringing on to the customers into our space. And so, I think we're seeing both growth in large customers and a broader set of customers, which -- but at the same time, I think in Q4, we saw a number of those smaller customers come on, convert into larger deals within the quarter, particularly in the commercial space. And we're seeing a number of these smaller customers convert longer-term enterprise deals, and we're seeing the momentum there. I also think, at the same time, we're seeing a lot of the ability to sell across a broader set of customers in a smaller price range in a way that we can get started at a smaller price point, but then grow from there as well. Alex Karp : 53% of our business are large deals, and that's almost $50 million. So that -- some people love that. Some people don't. I loved it because it means we're a little more recession-proof. So then you have a tale of two stories, tale of two cities. The small -- the average revenue size went from 6.5 to just over $5 million. So it's decreasing. It's decreasing for exactly the reason Ryan says. It's decreasing because we're doing well in the U.S. Most U.S. commercial customers don't buy $50 million contracts. They buy $2 million, $3 million contracts. I think we're going to see a lot more of that. What I see on the ground there are a lot of people wanting to use our software. We believe in our software. So we're open to a lower price point. We are more expensive than what I would offer some other products, but that we also think it's more valuable. So I think what you're going to see is kind of a tale of two cities at Palantir, large contracts getting larger and many, many more small contracts, especially in the U.S. Ana Soro : Thank you, Alex and Ryan. Alex, we have a lot of individual investors on the line. Is there anything you'd like to say before we end the call? Alex Karp : We -- I value individual investors quite a bit, we do at Palantir, all of us at Palantir, individual investors. We listen to you. We are very proud that we're GAAP profitable in Q4 last year. We plan to be GAAP profitable this year. That's in part because we listened to you. It's in great part because we listened to our partners and customers on the frontline and at institutions that rely on us for their livelihood and for their life that they need to -- they need a company, they need talent here to be as strong as possible. That's why we became -- we went into the black, why we're planning to stay in the black on a yearly basis and why we have $2.6 billion in the bank and no debt. And it's going to be tough weather out there. We believe, I believe the macroeconomic environment, the political environment is going to be rough and often terrible. That gives Palantir crucial role, and we really, really respect your support. Ana Soro : Thank you. That concludes Q&A for today's call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ana Soro : Good afternoon. I'm Ana Soro from Palantir's finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market close and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our second quarter and fiscal 2023 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects, and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which would cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market close today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation, and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons, unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I'll now turn it over to Alex for opening remarks. Alex Karp : On any normal earnings call where we have just been profitable and where we're going to be profitable for the next quarter -- next couple of quarters, which opens up the possibility to be on the S&P, where the U.S. market grew by 28% and where we made $187 million in free cash flow, that would be the thing that was the most exciting. But in fact, what's most exciting about Palantir is, we have our ability to launch products that are literally the only products on the market and that will, in fact, change your life and will determine who succeeds and who fails across enterprise, both government and commercial. The large language model revolution is one that will raise ships and sink ships. Of course, the profitability is important. Of course, the fact that we make free cash flow is important. But it's not nearly as exciting as our ability to invest our resources and our founder-led energy in using our -- the things we've have built to supply enterprises with an otherwise not available and in crazy high-demand product. This is just one of the most exciting times to be at Palantir, because you have the resources of a large profitable enterprise company. So, there is an issue with non-profitable tech, if you're powering the most important enterprises in the world. They want to know, \"Can you provide the resources, the product we need tomorrow, purely on a financial basis?\" But more importantly to us and to them long-term is, \"Can you help us disrupt our adversaries? Can you just help us disrupt our competitors? Can -- for me personally, can you have a product that will help the West win, especially our government, but also our commercial clients, so that we, in fact, are stronger than our adversaries?\" And in the last 20 years, there's never been a development like this. You have a technology that will allow you to outproduce; change the margin of the company; understand your business; react on the battlefield quicker; predict things on the battlefield in a way; collapse your enterprise, so that the top and the bottom actually work together; pre-empt attacks; create software that is so obviously dominant that adversaries quiver and scurry away instead of attacking us or our allies. And there is one company in the world that is positioned. The issue of how do you have security, a data model or knowledge and wisdom that's proprietary, interact with an external large language model or with generative AI is not new to Palantir, and that's why we were able to launch our platform AIP so quickly, the demand for -- of which is nothing I've ever seen in 20 years of being involved in Palantir. And the reason the demand is high is people suspect that -- if we wield these technologies correctly, safely and securely, meaning extract the value, in the context of your own enterprise, whether that's sensitive or non-sensitive or regulated or it's moderately regulated, you have a weapon that will allow you to win, that will scare your competitors and adversaries, and we are in a unique position to supply that platform and we have the resources, both because of our profitability, our $2.9 billion in the bank, our lack of debt, and quite frankly, our entrepreneurial founder-led spirit at this company. Welcome to our earnings day. Thank you. Ryan Taylor : As Alex highlighted, our company once again achieved GAAP profitability last quarter, including GAAP operating income for the first time. This marks another milestone in our company's sustained growth, ensuring that we will continue delivering results and impact for our partners for years to come, while also investing deeply in the transformational AI opportunities before us. We have been taking steps across the company in recent months to refocus our efforts and optimize on the parts of our business that will drive even further growth alongside and sustain profitability. In Q1 2023, we generated $525 million in revenue. Due to the seasonality of our business, Q1 tends to be our slowest quarter, but despite that headwind and the difficult macroeconomic environment that the technology industry continues to face, our commercial business generated $236 million of revenue last quarter and achieved $176 million in TCV, a 70% year-over-year TCV increase. These strong results were driven primarily by the re-acceleration of our U.S. commercial business, which surpassed the $100 million revenue threshold for the first time with 26% year-over-year growth. We continue to see robust pilot starts and promising conversions and we're also beginning to see the realization of our expansion strategy, meaning we're beginning to see meaningful growth and upsell opportunities with our newer customer base. Some notable examples include the expansion of our work with Hertz, who is using Foundry to more efficiently manage and operate its fleet of nearly 500,000 vehicles; and Jacobs Engineering, who is doubling down on our partnership to reduce cost and improve performance across plants. We also signed significant expansion agreements with the largest health system in the country for continued acceleration of our hospital operations efforts, and with one of the world's largest paper and packaging companies. Our U.S. commercial customer base, which stood at 155 at the end of Q1 2023, a seven-fold increase in customer count over just two years, presents an immense opportunity for continued expansion. While aspects of our international commercial business have been challenging in today's climate, we continue to focus on delivering transformational results to long-term customers. For example, BP, our customer of over a decade, recently shared that Foundry helped them reduce production cost by approximately 60% from $14 a barrel to less than $6 a barrel. We're also investing for growth in targeted industries and geographies, such as Korea, where I recently met with customers and saw our momentum there firsthand. This includes several strong pilot starts in the expansion of our work with Korea shipbuilding and offshore engineering, focused on using Foundry to enhance safety and operational efficiency. Our government business generated $289 million in revenue, driven in large part by our U.S. government business, which grew 22% year-over-year. With strong conviction in our work on the ground and the critical missions we're delivering against, we continue to focus on building our U.S. government business for the long-term while acknowledging timing uncertainty in the short term. We're investing in delivering digital deterrence and AI-driven efforts around the world from the Middle Eastern, Pacific and European theaters. And with pressing global events, we continue to lean into our support for the U.S. and its allies across Eastern Europe. More broadly, as we look at opportunities across our company, we are strongly investing in AI efforts, with a focus on delivering the foundational systems and software architecture that will enable enterprises to leverage the power of the latest large language models and other machine learning technologies. We're already seeing unprecedented demand for AIP, and we are reorganizing our efforts aggressively to capitalize on the interest. We anticipate that these technologies will be transformational, both for ourselves and for our customers, and we are positioned to meet the moment. I'll now turn it over to Shyam. Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Ryan. This past February, overlapping with our last earnings call, I had the opportunity to visit Ukraine and witness the incredible speed with which the Ukrainian forces were able to employ AI on the battlefield. It was clear that the future has already arrived. And that future requires us broadly to rewrite roadmaps. It changes everything to some degree and some things completely. We all can either choose to join the disruptors driving this change or we can be disrupted. From diffusion to large language models, the accelerating pace of AI development is awe inspiring and exhilarating, but there are many challenges customers will encounter as they attempt to leverage this technology operationally at any scale. From managing the mismatch between the ever-growing big data scale of the enterprise and the bottlenecks and choke points of smaller context windows of LLM's, to product design challenges of constructively embedding these models and workflows, and safety and trust challenges in governing the AI in an operational and decision-making context, we are well ahead of the curve because we've built the frameworks, the infrastructure, and the software needed. We have already had to solve so many of the hard problems, including the development of deep expertise with the necessary intermediary scale data challenges required to effectively span the gap from big data to small LLM context windows. And there will be many surprises and who ultimately comes up as the winners and losers of all of this disruption. The AI models themselves within months have gone from cutting-edge to quickly being commoditized. Developing GPT-2 and GPT-3 class models at this point, table stakes. Anyone can build them in a few days with a few hundred dollars. As the memo purportedly leaked from Google titled, \"We Have No Moat, And Neither Does OpenAI\" makes clear things that big tech companies have considered major open areas of development have actually been solved by a handful of people in the open-source community. While some of the proprietary models hold a slight quality edge, the lead is vanishing quickly. The speed of iteration on these models biasing to a goldilocks size of power iteration pace ratio will dominate. We believe larger enduring value is more likely to emerge from the application and workflow layer by the players who know how to navigate the challenges of data skill mismatch that LLMs present, and we are uniquely positioned to continue to be a leader here. And because that future is already here, we must act with speed and conviction. Customers must completely rethink what they are building and how they build it. We are moving fast to ensure existing customers can quickly deploy AIP beside Gotham and Foundry to transform their operations with intelligent, contextual decision-making and sophisticated automation and coordination from the battlefield to the boardroom. AIP enables customers to operate not only Foundry and Gotham, but also their businesses from a greater strategic vantage point. We provide powerful interfaces to rapidly integrate your data, build your ontology, forge AI-driven applications and workflows, and build agents to orchestrate and automate enterprise actions. All in an environment with guardrails, safe hand-off functions, and military-grade security. AIP not only knows how to speak to you, but more importantly, it knows how to speak to Gaia, MetaConstellation, every Foundry service, your ontology, and your enterprise. At a major insurance company, we deployed a pre-release version of AIP and in a few days built a collaborative AI agent to automate claims processing. The Chief Data Officer told us that AIP was years ahead of anything they had seen. The pace of innovation around AI and LLMs presents a unique opportunity for leveraging our Apollo and FedStart infrastructure. There is tremendous demand for these modules in FedRAMP, IL5 and IL6. Via our FedStart offering, we can bring these startups to U.S. government markets in weeks. In Q1, we also closed our first $1 million deal for Apollo with a major tech company. Our Foundry Ontology SDK has met the market to a great reception. These SDKs make it easy for customers to build new enterprise applications and integrate ontology into their existing ones. We plan to support AIP directly from these SDKs, extending the AI application forge deep into your enterprise ecosystem. The Gotham ecosystem continues to expand with enhanced capabilities across the AI-enabled kill chain. Our most recent developments include substantial new capabilities called [Maverick] (ph) and fires in the broader air battle management process. This capability enables efficient translation of approved targets to weapon systems. On a final note, we will be sharing our insights on the latest cutting-edge AI, who will be the victors and the vanquished, and of course, showing the latest across AIP and Foundry, as well as hearing from our customers on how our products are powering their transformations at our June 1 customer event in Palo Alto. With that, I'll turn it over to Dave. Dave Glazer : Thanks, Shyam. The first quarter of 2023 was a record-setting quarter for us. We achieved our second consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability and also achieved GAAP operating income for the first time. This accomplishment was a result of strong top-line growth, driven by the reacceleration of our U.S. commercial business, coupled with continued disciplined spend management. These achievements demonstrate our commitment to driving profitable growth and we continue to expect 2023 to be our first full year of GAAP profitability. On the back of these exceptional results and this trajectory, we now expect to be GAAP profitable in each quarter this year. Turning to our global top-line results. We generated $525 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2023, up 18% year-over-year, $20 million ahead of the midpoint of our prior guidance. Our U.S. business generated $337 million in total revenue in the first quarter, up 23% year-over-year and 12% sequentially, demonstrating our continued momentum in the US. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. First quarter, trailing 12-month revenue per customer from our top 20 customers increased 14% year-over-year to $51 million per customer. New customer acquisition also remains strong as we saw customer count grow 41% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Now moving to our commercial segment. In the first quarter of 2023, commercial revenue grew 15% year-over-year and 10% sequentially to $236 million. Our first quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 26% year-over-year and 39% sequentially to $107 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, U.S. commercial revenue grew 46% year-over-year and 24% sequentially. In addition to the strength of our U.S. commercial revenue growth, our U.S. commercial customer count grew 50% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Commercial revenue from our strategic commercial contracts surpassed first quarter expectations at $33 million due to the unanticipated acceleration of revenue from certain of these contracts. We expect second quarter revenue from these customers to be between $17 million and $19 million and to drop off significantly in the third and fourth quarter. Our expectations of full year revenue from these customers remains unchanged at approximately 3% of total full year revenue. In the first quarter, our international commercial business grew 8% year-over-year and declined 7% sequentially. The results were impacted in part due to a tough comparison to the prior quarter as a result of the timing of revenue recognition on certain contracts in the fourth quarter and the seasonal headwinds we often see in the first quarter with some of our largest international enterprise customers. Turning to our government segment. First quarter government revenue grew 20% year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially to $289 million. First quarter U.S. government revenue grew 22% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to $230 million. While we have a strong pipeline of opportunities in our U.S. government business, we acknowledge that there are uncertainties associated with the timing of these contract expansions and renewals. Nonetheless, we remain confident in the growth of our U.S. government business. First quarter international government revenue grew 11% year-over-year and declined 13% sequentially to $59 million. The sequential decline was driven by the non-recurring revenue catch-up that we saw in the fourth quarter, as well as some challenges with the timing of contract awards in the first quarter. Turning to bookings. TCV booked in the first quarter was $397 million, up 60% year-over-year. U.S. commercial TCV grew 170% year-over-year to $124 million, again demonstrating the strength of our U.S. commercial business. We ended the first quarter with $3.4 billion in total remaining deal value and $936 million in remaining performance obligations. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business, as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business. Both remaining deal value and remaining performance obligations have continued to face headwinds from the macroeconomic impact on customers from the strategic investment program. As a result, the total remaining deal value and the total value of our commercial contracts from our strategic investment program decreased by $102 million since last quarter as we continue to review and assess the financial condition of these businesses. Turning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 81% for the quarter. First quarter adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was $125 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 24%, 600 basis points ahead of our prior guidance and marking the third consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins. These results demonstrate our ability to drive strong revenue growth while managing cost effectively, with first quarter adjusted expenses up only 1% sequentially to $400 million. We continued to manage expense growth by optimizing operations in G&A, capturing cloud efficiencies and focusing our headcount investments in key strategic areas. We remain committed to sustaining GAAP profitability, while at the same time increasing investment in both the U.S. to capture the momentum we are seeing, and in the development of advanced software capabilities, particularly our AI-driven offerings. We believe that artificial intelligence, including large language models, will prove transformational for our business and for enterprises in the government and commercial context. To that end, we are rebalancing our efforts and investment to capitalize on these developments. In the first quarter, we generated income for operations of $4 million, our first-ever quarter of GAAP operating income. This reflects our laser focus on profitable growth and continued management of our stock-based compensation. While we expect to see stock-based compensation expense trend up through the remainder of the year, we remain focused on GAAP net income and operating profitability. Turning to net income. First quarter GAAP net income was $17 million, our second consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. This was a result of our strong GAAP operating income, as well as interest income from our balance sheet and the narrowing of losses from investments. First quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.05 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.01, our second consecutive quarter of positive GAAP EPS. We are extremely proud that we are able to continue to deliver GAAP profitability on a consistent basis. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin was 42% in the first quarter. We will continue to strive to achieve the Rule 40 throughout 2023 and beyond. Turning to our strong cash flow in the first quarter, we generated $189 million and $187 million in adjusted free cash flow and cash from operations, respectively, each representing a margin of 36%. We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. treasury bills. We retain access to additional liquidity of up to $950 million through our $500 million revolving credit facility and $450 million delayed-draw term-loan facility, both of which remain entirely undrawn. Now turning to our outlook. For Q2 2023, we expect revenue of between $528 million and $532 million. Adjusted income from operations of between $118 million and $122 million, and GAAP net income. For full year 2023, we are raising our revenue guidance to between $2.185 billion and $2.235 billion. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to between $506 million and $556 million, and we now expect GAAP net income in each quarter of this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Ana to start the Q&A. A - Ana Soro : Thanks, Dave. We'll begin with a few questions from our shareholders before we open up the call. We received a lot of questions on AI and AIP. Alex, would you like to share some thoughts? Alex Karp : Well, thank you for being here. I've been at the Palantir, building since the beginning, for 20 years. Our first product was PG, which changed the course of history, especially in Europe, by preventing terror attacks in a constitutional order. And that product basically is the only product for what -- for that use-case in the world. And then, we built a number of other products, products on the battlefield, for special operators, Foundry, which needs no introduction. And in the process of building these products, we were always thinking about human mind, human-computer symbiotic relationships, and then later algorithmic relationships to data, especially what's called generative AI. And so, we had built these precursor technologies over the -- since inception and also biases. So, how would you interact with an algorithm where you expos only the part of the enterprise that you want to expose, need to expose? How would you do a hand-off when you're doing -- deciding to make a lethal decision? Who makes the legal decision? What data sources are used? How do you map the knowledge and wisdom of your enterprise onto the external database? And then with the rise of large language models, how do you impose that on the large language model? How do you take what's useful from AI, whether, especially in a large language model context without hallucinating your way into a disaster? How do you expose sensitive parts of your enterprise that need to be exposed, while protecting parts of your enterprise that should never be exposed, not just in the classified environment, but if you're working in a hospital context, exposing healthcare -- personal healthcare data to a broader LLM run by a third-party? How do you do this in a context where some people are technical and non-technical? How do you expand our offering? And this is one of the big advantages of the current revolution to people who have varied technical needs, but don't know how to wield them. And in general, our business has been a business driven by moral imperatives. One of my -- I don't want to make this overly philosophical, although in some ways I prefer it. But when you look at the history of Silicon Valley over the last 20 years, there is a, in a weird way, a tacit alliance between the way in which our maybe adversaries think of the world and the way in which many people in Silicon Valley have thought about, essentially we will use data to serve our interests, not inherently the interest of the people, meaning in our context, it should be monetized. And we have always believed in a moral imperative, where the human and our governments would define the context in which data and algorithmatic and now large language models implicitly would be controlled. And so that looks like a weird philosophical bias, but in fact that philosophical and bias allowed us to develop branching, allowed us develop ways of doing hand-off technologies, it allows us to think broadly about what it means to be in lethal situations and behave ethically, it now positioned us to be able to launch ways in which to deal with large language models that are -- is a once-in-a-generational opportunity with technologies that are otherwise not available by other people. Also, even our bias of understanding, as Shyam was saying in his introduction, that it is the person that wields the technology that makes it valuable, that makes it moral, not the technology itself. These biases have just put us very, very far ahead of the market. And especially, we are seeing this -- reception to this in United States, which makes me obviously particularly happy. And so, we're going to be very involved in rolling this out in a kind of pretty disciplined way. We see this unprecedented once-in-a-generation opportunity. We have odd resources in terms of IP, software platforms that are uniquely suited for this. We have an ability to run hard both because we are entrepreneurial. Many people in this space, in fact, don't really build products, they buy products. So, it's too late to buy a product to catch up with what has to be done now, and where the winners will really accelerate. So, we feel like we're at a -- obviously, our profitability is really important to us, particularly because, as we begin to power more and more of them, most important institutions in the world, it basically takes off the table the legitimate question, \"Well, if your technology is so powerful, why can't you make any money?\" So, I believe it's unique time for us, unique place for us, and we're very, very busy at work. Ana Soro : Thanks, Alex. We also received a few questions on GAAP profitability. [Vishal and Rick] (ph) ask, do you still expect to be GAAP profitable this year? Dave Glazer : Vishal and Rick, thanks for the question. In short, absolutely we do. And really on the strength of Q1, we now know -- we expect to be profitable in each quarter of this year, not just for the full year, which is obviously a big milestone for us. And to recap Q1, it was our second consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. We did $17 million of net income. It's our first-ever GAAP operating income profitable quarter. We did $4 million of operating income. It's our strongest cash flow quarter ever, $189 million of free cash flow. And we did this all with the U.S. commercial business growing 39% sequentially. And so, profitability, it will remain core to our growth and as we mobilize our business and our resources around the AI opportunities that are in front of us. Ana Soro : Thanks, Dave. We received questions about expanding our customer base and the growth and momentum of our commercial business. Ryan, do you want to share some thoughts on the commercial business for 2023? Ryan Taylor : Yeah, absolutely. So in our results, you see the re-acceleration of our U.S. commercial business, 26% year-over-year growth, U.S. commercial, as Dave said, 39% sequential. Our customer count, which is now at 155 customers in our U.S. commercial business, grew 50% year-over-year, and the TCV closed in Q1 grew 170% year-over-year. That's on the back of pilot conversions, new pilot starting, and expansions at customers, as I highlighted earlier, such as Hertz, Jacobs Engineering, the largest health system in the country, and one of the largest paper and packaging companies in the world among other examples. We expect that momentum to carry forward, and as the U.S. commercial continues to become a larger and larger part of our overall business, that will obviously have larger and larger impacts on our overall results and momentum as well. On top of that, we've highlighted AI presented in opportunity that is creating unprecedented demand for us. We can deliver against it in ways that no one else can and we're running at full speed and we expect that momentum to continue in 2023 and beyond. Ana Soro : Thanks, Ryan. Our next question is from Michael who asks with potential S&P 500 inclusion, how does that correlate with the company's prospects and profitability moving forward? Alex Karp : I'm sure there's a prepared answer here, but I believe or I know that we are outsiders, and this outsider status is one of the main reasons we built all these products because we never ever thought anyone would buy our products except for that they were disruptive and unique. And that's in many -- if you look at the products we've built, but also in somehow our uncanny preparedness for this moment, it's because we approach this as we have to succeed under adverse conditions. My interest in profitability is for obvious reasons, but it's also, I think we'll just be in a much stronger position as we -- it becomes clear that we are -- we qualify for participation in S&P, and a lot of people look as a fresh, new and we'll begin to look closer at our strengths. But in anyways, this is -- the outsider strategy is, we are going to be profitable. We're going -- within the context of being profitable, we are going to take our resources and disrupt, especially in the U.S. of A, and we are going to use the profitability to scale our business, and to scale attractiveness of our business to new investors. Ana Soro : Thanks, Alex. Our next question is from Brent with Jefferies. Brent, please turn on your camera, and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. There were a lot of questions about, in the quarter, the backlog growth significantly decelerated, yet the comments about the overall business re-accelerating, you guys were clear about. And so there were questions around, were there any one-time milestone JV rev rec or SPAC contribution in the quarter that may have explained this? And can you just comment about the backlog growth versus the comments you said about re-acceleration, because they don't really match up when we look at the numbers? Dave Glazer : Yeah, happy to take that, and I think just to start off, when you're looking at re-acceleration, I'd point to, the U.S. commercial business is really driving our business forward and sort of where our focus is, and it did reaccelerate significantly in Q1, right? It was 26% year-over-year growth, 39% sequential. If you want to exclude SPAC revenue, it grew over 45% and grew 24% sequentially, so like exceptional reacceleration. And then if you want to look at bookings, you can look at U.S. TCV up 170% -- excuse me, U.S. commercial TCV is up 170% year-over-year. So like all the measures are there. Alex Karp : I think, look I [do want to] (ph) give you a somewhat orthogonal answer to your question. We have a tale of two cities here. We have America, which is growing around 28%, it is now 64% of our business. Four years ago was 37% of our business. We are absolutely disrupting in the U.S. of A. International is growing around 10% and that is becoming obviously a smaller part of our business. And so what you -- what I tend to see when I look at the numbers is, yeah, if we believe the U.S. is -- we see the U.S. is growing, we see that U.S. is reaccelerating. Although reaccelerating is the wrong word because, in fact, U.S. commercial has been accelerating and accelerating, and it's just become a much bigger part of our business. And last not least, what's not in the numbers is, I spend a lot of my time on the road. I'm talking to the U.S. customers. I'm talking, and they're not -- the quality of the questions has shifted from \"Why would we need this?\" to \"How would I use it?\" And that's just purely on the Foundry front. And then, the inbound on anything related to AI, both from existing customers -- by the way on that score, we sit on the world's most important private sensitive networks, both in commercial and government. Every single one of those clients needs an AI strategy and we have unique technology and software for that. So -- but I think if you were -- if you wanted to look at the positive and negative of our business, yeah, sure, we -- I do not expect international to grow much more than it's growing now. I do expect the U.S. to continue to grow, and we're very optimistic about what will happen there. Ana Soro : Thanks, Alex. Our next question is from Mariana with Bank of America. Mariana, please turn on your camera and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Mariana, can you hear us? Alex Karp : Hello? Mariana Perez Mora : Do you hear me? Alex Karp : Yeah. Mariana Perez Mora : Oh, perfect. I've troubles with technology still. There. I'm unmuted. Okay. My question is about the... Alex Karp : We can't hear you. Ana Soro : Sorry, Mariana, you're cutting out. Mariana Perez Mora : I'm so sorry. Ana Soro : No problem, we can just move on. Our next question is from Keith with Morgan Stanley. Keith, please turn on your camera and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Keith Weiss : All right. Can you guys hear me? Alex Karp : Yeah. Keith Weiss : Thanks a lot. So, we talked a lot about accelerating U.S. commercial business, reorienting the company for certain extent for this commercial opportunity with the AI platform. Two questions. One, can you talk just a little bit about changes that you're looking to make in the go-to-market for this AI platform? Any sense you could give us in terms of how you're looking to price the platform? What sort of like the initial conversations been like and what do you think that pricing modality is going to be like around that AI platform? And then, the last question on GAAP profitability. This quarter you did have a pull-forward of revenues that kind of helped the commercial business, helped the overall profitability. To some sense, you've got to make that up a little bit in Q2 and Q3. Are there any tactical things that you're doing or cost reduction initiatives that you're putting in place to ensure that GAAP profitability to offset that pull-forward, that upfront revenue recognition you saw in Q1? Thank you. Alex Karp : I'll take that AI think and Shyam maybe you want to add something and you can talk about all of our various strategies to be more and more efficient. No, our basic -- it's counter-intuitive, but we're going to -- within the context of being profitable, our idea -- our strategy on AI is just to take the whole market. We have no pricing strategy. We're going to create a lot of value. We're going to get hundreds of customers and we will price it as we go. One of the things we've seen over and over again is, when you're ahead of the market, you need to take territory. We want to take territory for two reasons. One, we believe we have the only product currently on the market that can solve some of these intricate technical needs. Two, we've spent years building certain things, like how do you manage knowledge systems across algorithms, across security interest. We know how hard it is to build this. We believe that people -- will take years for people to build these things. And three, because as we take territory, educate the market, and the market, quite frankly, many analysts believe this stuff is really easy. You educate the market and to see how hard it is, and in doing that you then have pricing parity, because they will try other things that for technical reasons are likely to fail. So, our -- especially in the U.S., we have some non-U.S. customers. There are some exceptions to this. We can't do this for free for governments for legal reasons and because we have so many already AI-driven clients, but in the U.S. commercial context, our strategy is going to be to take territory, educate the market, and make it very difficult for other people entering the market because they have to compete with a product that's we've already been working on for de facto years, with solving technical issues that the market doesn't yet realize exist. Then I'll leave... Shyam Sankar : Yeah, from a product perspective with AIP, we're just razor-focused on creating value as quickly as possible. I think it's not actually clear from the outside, how far ahead we are. If you think about the intermediary scale data challenges that you face in getting value out of LLMs and their extremely small context windows, like how are you going to bridge the gap between big data and smaller context windows, you need an ontology. And all these guys -- like, how did we build an insurance GPT agent in two days, because we stood on the shoulders of two years of a very robust ontology that enabled us to unlock... Alex Karp : Maybe you should explain what an ontology is, because for most people... Shyam Sankar : Yeah, I can take the rest of the call with that, but [Multiple Speakers] you have the semantic representation of the business, sometimes people call it digital twin, I hate that because it cheapens it and how it's been diluted. But like what is the business? How do we think about it? How is the data mapped to the operations that happened? And then, you have the kinetic layer of like, how do we make decisions? How do I adjudicate the claim? What does that mean? How does it flow through the system? These are prerequisites. You can think about that second piece, the kinetics as the tools you give the LLMs to actually drive and automate your business processes. And when you think about the former part of like how do actually reason about what's going on and I need that as almost like a form of compression to get everything into that small context window, right, that's a physical limitation of the LLMs. So I think the amount of ground we can take means that the only reasonable strategy is to focus on... Alex Karp : Implicit in what Shyam is saying is the -- without -- essentially other people call it knowledge graph, in fact, de facto you could view it as like a dynamics semantic layer, where the assumptions of your world are built-in and can map across your -- you will just not be able to use this technology. Now that's something we know, no one else knows, no one believes it, but they're about to find out. And so, we don't have to have this debate with people. We just going to show clients, \"Hey, this will work. You will get value. We've done this before. It's also crazy hard to build this.\" So, if you know how to do it, you have a three-year build. Shyam Sankar : And we didn't even talk about the guardrails, the military-grade security, the safe hand-off functions that are extent, like we can go running at this so hard. Alex Karp : And again, in a highly regulated environment. Whether people listening just like it or not, America is a highly regulated environment. You will not be able to use this technology without -- what Shyam is calling guardrails, what he really means is with a branching technology where [indiscernible] can be applied to the internal systems in a way that you can still get the work -- be able to do the work because you have a semantic layer. And that's all garbley-gook to people, except for it will not be garbley-gook to everybody who wants to use this technology in a productive way. And we just -- we spent 20 years building these things and we're going to litigate that on the front and figure out how we get paid later. Dave Glazer : And on GAAP profitability, we're going to get there with the U.S. business. And when you look to U.S. commercial, that will help push us there. And then when you look at sort of what we've been doing on the cost side, G&A efficiency, the cloud cost we keep talking about because it really is making a difference in our business. And then we're going to be prudent with our headcount in certain places and in other places, we're going to really... Alex Karp : I mean, there is an obvious thing, we're growing -- we believe and the numbers show we're disrupting in the U.S. We're going to invest heavily in places we're growing 10%, we're going to reduce costs, there's no mystery here. Ana Soro : Thanks. Alex, as always, we have a lot of individual investors on the line. Is there anything you'd like to say before we end the call? Alex Karp : You are my favorite investors, I say it every call. A lot of the decisions we make are made because we are in full alignment with you. There is a tenancy among leads to overlook your knowledge. My experience is the people that pay attention to the product, the powder products used and are more accurate in the strengths and weaknesses of PG, Foundry semantic layer and now AI are very often people investing their own money. And now as we go become profitable in the next few quarters, I expect that we will become part of the S&P and we'll have many more institutional investors, but I will not start valuing you, and I appreciate your support. Ana Soro : Thanks. That concludes Q&A for today's call.",

We\u2019ll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market close and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our third quarter and fiscal 2023 results, management\u2019s expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Further, during the course of today\u2019s call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Alex for opening remarks. Alex Karp : Welcome to our earnings. We are at a unique period at Palantir. Through the course of the last 20 years, we built what is in arguably one of the most interesting, impactful product offerings in the world, PG, Foundry, our target selection platform, Apollo. Our goal at Palantir was to be the most impactful, important software company in the world, a company transforming Western institutions and the underlying goal there was to make the West stronger and to make Palantir the most important software company in the world. In a weird way, in the last couple of months since we launched AIP since we had AIPCon. We have seen the way in which technologies we\u2019ve built that seem to be of moderate utility were built almost in anticipation of the AI revolution, both algorithmatic and large language models. And that convergence has remade Palantir, taking Palantir away from its terminal value being it made the world better by making our institutions in the West stronger, more productive, more efficient, in some cases, more deadly to giving us the aspiration and realistic perspective of being the most valuable enterprise software company in the world. We see a market, especially in the U.S., which is hungry for an ability to apply AI, both large language models and algorithms to transform our businesses. I believe this transformation will change the GDP of America and that Palantir will participate in that -- in the delta between where the GDP is now and where, it will get to powered by unique technologies that are almost exclusively being built in the United States and are being adopted more rapidly and more efficiently with more vigor. Of course, there are headwinds. Many of the people and companies who have no product offer and do not have the technical capabilities to build them, are trying to slow down this revolution for the obvious reason that they\u2019re not participating. And these tools are accelerating innovation, so that if you\u2019re not participating, you\u2019re literally standing still, while everyone is accelerating and there are no longer luxury products in the way people thought having world-class software was. So buying Foundry appeared to many institutions as well, of course, it\u2019s the best product, but it\u2019s -- it would require us to change how we function or change how we procure software. By the way, the large language model revolution has changed Palantir\u2019s relationships institutions because we were misaligned for years and years with IT all globally. We were misaligned with the way in which we thought an enterprise should be run. But the way in which you actually can process large language models to get more exact, more precise, more operationally valuable insights, the way you can actually write them safely into your enterprise, meaning you can control your enterprise. The way you can turn them into Logic that allows you to power your enterprise, both in the read, write function with a governance that is mandated by law or by ethics. We provide those ways of working are exactly the ways we always thought one would have to work, but before the delta was insufficient. And then last not least, there\u2019s no roadmap. Palace is the world\u2019s best at no roadmap, innovation products built for a world where things disintegrate and you actually need to do things in the way they would be done in the natural state. So in the natural state, you would have something like Foundry, you would have an ontology, you would have AIP. Institutions in America are going back to their natural state, a state for which we\u2019ve built products, especially in the U.S. We -- you see this in Palantir\u2019s numbers. So why is that? Because we built products for the natural state of how an enterprise should work. That state is apparent to people because of the enormous power, the power to accelerate time to change your business using large language models, and therefore, it is something which people embrace. We\u2019ve now moved from being and that product, our product, our culture fits both efficiently and in a way that\u2019s prismatic to especially U.S. commercial institutions and also government institutions that are realistically aware of the dangers of adversaries who are cutting and exceedingly competent especially at technology. So this puts us in a remade transformed position where we can -- the aspiration of powering our most important institutions, which is clearly nowhere near done. So intelligence and defense has gotten us to the point where I think it\u2019s indisputable that Palantir\u2019s software in that space is the most important in the world. Now in -- while continuing to focus on that, we can focus on, okay, but given that we\u2019ve built these precursor technologies, given that our product has moved from being nascent to having thousands of users, the AIP product, given that we believe that the reception to this is unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in PG, Foundry, Apollo, target selection. And given the receptivity of the market, also not to mention that we have been profitable. Now we expect to be eligible for the S&P for several quarters. We\u2019ve been profitable that we have over $3 billion in the bank. That positions us to fulfill our new aspiration allows us to see in the future how we would do that, which is to simply be the most valuable enterprise software company in the world and we are joyous for this moment. And thank you for being with us today. Ryan Taylor : For the third consecutive quarter, our company achieved GAAP profitability and again maintained a GAAP operating income in Q2. This is a testament to our steadfast focus and commitment to delivering results and impact for our partners, all while innovating against the AI opportunities ahead. Last quarter, we hosted AIPCon, which convened over 150 unique organizations as we formally launched our new AIP product offering and customers demonstrated how we\u2019re partnering with them to unlock the value of AI. For example, Jacobs Engineering highlighted how AIP is enabling them to monitor current system conditions and conduct future infrastructure planning in real time versus the months of analysis it would have taken previously. Similarly, J.D. Power\u2019s Chief Digital and Technology Officer asserted that the advantage comes not from the AI models you can build, but rather how you apply them to the data you have and deploy it into applications. This is where true value is created for our customers and where we stand poised to help. The CEO of Novartis was recently interviewed on CNBC discussing our partnership in which we created an integrated data lake that they are now leveraging to move AI forward quickly within the company, which the CEO calls Novartis\u2019 quote fundamental advantage over its peers. We launched AIP just 10 weeks ago and already we\u2019re seeing unprecedented inbound interest. AIP is also opening expansion conversations with our largest, longest tenured customers as the new capabilities are causing them to reimagine how they can use our software. Looking at both existing and new customers, AIP is the solution for organizations who want to wheel the LLM securely in their enterprise. We remain focused on aggressively capitalizing on this momentum by driving compounding growth of AIP usage. As this fast-moving market evolves and expands, so too will we and it\u2019s just the beginning. This increasing demand will be incremental to the results you see today. Our U.S. commercial business continues to deliver outsized results. With our rapidly growing customer count, we are seeing the beginning of the network effects in the segment, whether at events like AIPCon, through direct customer referrals to their network or by leaders working with us in one organization, taking us with them to their next one. We expect the expansion effect to be multiplicative. At the same time, we\u2019re seeing success across many different industries. In Q2, we closed deals in U.S. commercial in roughly 30 different industries, including across pharmaceuticals, energy, consumer staples, utilities, healthcare, construction, automotive, transportation, infrastructure, the list goes on and spans industries and institutions at the core of today\u2019s society. While we see the breadth of our software spanning industries, we still have immense opportunity for growth, both through expansion within these industries and growth in our existing customer relationships. For example, we\u2019re beginning to see this growth come to fruition in both healthcare and transportation, which grew 93% and 129% year-over-year, respectively. Foundry is being used at numerous healthcare facilities to generate nurse schedules and forecast patient placements, among other applications. For example, with Foundry, HCA now generates nurse schedules in 1 hour each month instead of 10 to 20. Tampa General has seen a 28% reduction in patient hold times and has reduced the time spent managing patient placements by 83%. And Cleveland Clinic has been able to accept an 8.5% increase in patient transfers from other hospitals in just four months since launch. While we continue to increase our breadth and expansion across industries, we also continue to grow at our existing customers. We had over two dozen U.S. commercial customers that brought in more than $1 million in revenue each during last quarter alone and we\u2019re seeing outsized growth from our newest customers, 54% of the U.S. commercial revenue, excluding strategic commercial contracts is from customers that have started since the beginning of 2021 with nearly all of the year-over-year growth coming from those same customers. We expect this trend to continue. We are investing in pockets of momentum within our international commercial business, such as Japan, Korea, Canada and the Middle East, among other targeted opportunities across the world. For example, through our go-to-market partnership, Fujitsu has seen recent success onboarding eight new large-cap household name Japanese customers. At the same time, we are seeing AIP lead to expansion conversations with our largest longstanding customers in Europe, all against the challenging backdrop of today\u2019s climate. On the international government side, our U.K. Government business was particularly strong in Q2 as a result of our work with organizations such as the NHS and U.K. Ministry of Defense, including the Royal Navy. Within our U.S. Government business, while the revenue results in Q2 are disappointing, they belie the long-term strength of our business. We remain focused on converting significant deals in the pipeline and growing existing contracts through which we are core to the government mission. In Q2, we secured a multiyear contract award from the U.S. Special Operations Command worth up to $463 million, new contract awards for the Air & Space Forces of $110 million and conversion of Army Research Lab R&D funding to longer term work with COCOMs, starting with CENTCOM. We believe in the criticality and meaningful impact our work is having in today\u2019s world events and its eventual monetization, as well as the exceptional user impact we deliver. At the same time, our U.S. Government business can be lumpy and we continue to expect there to be near-term uncertainty around timing of contract awards. Turning back to the overall business. We are excited about our vast opportunities in the quarters ahead. We\u2019re already seeing that AIP will be transformational for our customers and for our business. We look forward to continuing innovating at the forefront through this revolution. Lastly, on the back of our inaugural AIPCon in Q2, we\u2019re excited to share that we\u2019re hosting two additional events to the next AIPCon on September 14th and a new event, the Software for Government, S4G Summit on September 21st, which is specifically designed for our government customers. We look forward to sharing a recap of the events with you at future calls. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Shyam. Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Ryan. At AIPCon this past June, we introduced Palantir\u2019s AI platform, a core set of technologies designed to bring LLM to your enterprise to supercharge and accelerate your experiences from integrating data and hydrating our ontology to building AI-enabled applications and human agent teams with copilots. AIP enables you to deploy LLMs anchored in your data, on your private network and to safely orchestrate your enterprise with tools, actions and other AI models, all of this in a controlled, governed and trusted AI operating system. The accelerating pace of AI developments continues to be all inspiring. The key to capturing value is a fundamental recognition that we are dealing with something new and different that demand solving new integration and engineering challenges. It is, in many ways, easier to define an LLM by what it is not. It is not algorithmic reasoning. It is not human thought. Algorithmic reasoning operates as a process so well specified that there is no ambiguity in its execution like traditional code. Human thought is inherently creative and its previously most defining form natural language is inextrictably rat with ambiguity. Large language models occupy a middle ground between algorithmic reasoning and human thought. They are fluent in natural language, yet they don\u2019t really understand what they say. They are not good at executing algorithms yet, they can be instructed in ordinary pros. They are something else, non-algorithm compute. LLMs are statistics, not calculus. And the introduction of even one stochastic variable into a deterministic system makes the entire system now stochastic. At AIPCon(2) in September, I\u2019m going to unpack some of the foundational engineering challenges that we\u2019ve solved to manage and harness the stochasticity of these models and to enable the acceleration in our products. We are focused on driving compounding usage across industries, the problems that matter haven\u2019t changed. AIP and LLM radically accelerate the solutions. We are building on nearly 20 years of our products and experience solving these problems across more than 50 industries in every function in the value chain, only now doing it substantially faster. To name a few, a nurse shift handoff copilot for HCA, our pharmacokinetics translation assistant for Novartis, an inventory balancer copilot or a plant-based protein company, a supply chain copilot for a major beverage company. Our warranty claims copilot for U.S. auto manufacturer has made analysts twice as productive, saving them 3 hours to 4 hours a day. As J.D. Power\u2019s CTO, Bernardo said at AIPCon, the beauty of having Foundry and AIP is that you can build this really, really quickly. So we built this in a matter of days and iterated in a couple of weeks. To get the precision of calculus in the power of statistics, LLMs need to be paired with algorithmic and software tools. For example, models of forward inventory or an action registry to execute enterprise functions, a rich semantic layer to define the proper grounding and crucial primitives like scenarios that allow LLM to stage changes on branches. AIP is not only the best tool bench in this context. It is a tool factory that enables enterprises to quickly forge new bespoke tools in hours. LMMs can\u2019t, for example, calculate profitability or expected lead times, but they don\u2019t have to. They need to have access to the software tools that can. This is why AIP is positioned to deliver outcomes so quickly. It elegantly integrates LLMs into the calculus of your enterprise to accelerate the workflows that matter. Every week, we are releasing more features and expanding the AIP productivity suite of applications, which provide Wizzywig, what you say is what you get experiences. AIP Builder allows you to build your data pipelines with natural semantics. AIP Terminal is the command line for your AI operating system, enabling you to dynamically wheel your ontology tools and applications for ad-hoc exploration and problem solving. AIP Logic enables you to build LLM-backed functions with rich tool composition in its developer tool chain. And AIP Automate, lets you turn those Logic functions into agents, copilots and automations. One more item in the suite I want to highlight. AIP Assist, which accelerates today\u2019s users and users of AIP, Gotham and Foundry by providing help and helpers dynamically. AIP Assist is configured to be toolaware. So it knows not only everything from the product documentation, it also knows what actions it can take to manipulate the application state to actually resolve and advance the user\u2019s workflow. This supercharges our users. And as a technology, it should be available for any software to incorporate to supercharge their users. In the second half of this year, we anticipate accepting beta customers who want to use AIP Assist as a service offering in their own software. Turning to Gotham. The latest investments in Gotham performed excellently at CENTCOM\u2019s Digital Falcon Oasis and other exercise across combatant commands, including Global Information Dominance Experiment Series 6. We continue to invest in capabilities, delivering the next level of deterrents through the AI-enabled kill chain, inclusive of an integrated coalition deterrent. There\u2019s a lot more to say here, but I\u2019d rather hide our strength and bide our time against the adversaries. We continue to be very excited about Apollo. It continues to be a massive lever for Palantir internally, as well as a big market opportunity. Over the last few years, Apollo has allowed us to scale up internally for managing 15 high-side stacks to 82 without scaling our team. In the market, as more defense startups are born with the surge of VC investment in the space, we believe Apollo stands as the fastest and cheapest path to delivering new capabilities to regulated in the credit environments. And in Q2, we started seeing demand from the government itself as a customer. USG customers want to move existing services they manage into FedStart to reduce their own operating risk and compliance burden. In closing, we just wrapped up our annual Hack Week. Right after this call, I\u2019ll be binge watching all the submissions from the teams internally. I\u2019m very much looking forward to further acceleration of our roadmaps from compelling new ideas. I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave to walk through the financials. Dave Glazer : Thanks, Shyam. The second quarter of 2023 was exceptionally strong. We\u2019re proud to report our third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability and second consecutive quarter of GAAP operating profitability, generating $28 million of net income and $10 million of operating income. This also marked the third consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins, highlighting the operating leverage in our business. We surpassed the high end of our guidance for both revenue and adjusted income from operations yet again. We also achieved a significant revenue milestone, surpassing $2 billion in revenue on a trailing 12-month basis for the first time. We remain committed to driving profitable growth and we reaffirm our expectation of GAAP profitability in each quarter of this year, which would make us eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 following our Q3 results. Turning to our global topline results. We generated $533 million in revenue, up 13% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, exceeding the high end of the range of our prior guidance. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, total revenue grew 16% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. Trailing 12-month revenue per customer from our top 20 customers increased 15% year-over-year to $53 million per customer. Customer account grew 38% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to 421 customers, demonstrating the momentum in our ability to onboard and convert new customers. Now moving to our commercial segment. Second quarter commercial revenue grew 10% year-over-year and declined 2% sequentially to $232 million, a challenging sequential compare as anticipated due to the $14 million decline in revenue from strategic commercial contracts. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, commercial revenue grew 19% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. U.S. commercial revenue in the second quarter grew 20% year-over-year and declined 4% sequentially to $103 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, U.S. commercial revenue grew 37% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, a result that is even more impressive when compounded with the 24% sequential growth we saw last quarter. Our U.S. commercial customer count grew 35% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of sequential growth. This highlights the velocity we are seeing in our U.S. commercial business, where we\u2019re driving significant new customer wins and expansions. Our international commercial business grew 4% year-over-year to $129 million and remained flat sequentially. Relative to the U.S., we continue to see more muted growth with European commercial enterprises, although there remain targeted opportunities of growth internationally. Revenue from strategic commercial contracts was $19 million, compared to $33 million in the prior quarter. We expect third quarter revenue to decline to between $14 million to $16 million, and we anticipate fourth quarter revenue from these customers to continue to trend down. For the full year, we expect revenue for these customers to be approximately 3% of total full year revenue. Turning to our government segment. Government revenue grew 15% year-over-year and 4% sequentially to $302 million. U.S. Government revenue grew 10% year-over-year and declined 2% sequentially to $225 million. While we acknowledge that there are uncertainties associated with the timing of contract expansions and renewals, we maintain a strong pipeline of opportunities and remain confident in the growth of our U.S. Government business, particularly as USG TCV bookings grew 111% sequentially. International government revenue grew 31% year-over-year and 29% sequentially to $76 million. The reacceleration in our international government business was driven by our U.K. Government work. While our government business generally sees fluctuations due to the nature of funding and contract cycles, we remain confident that our work with the U.K. Government will continue to expand over the long-term. Turning to bookings. TCV booked was $642 million, up 62% sequentially. Billings was $603 million, up 52% year-over-year. We ended the second quarter with $3.4 billion in total remaining deal value and $968 million in remaining performance obligations. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business. Turning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense was 81% for the quarter. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes was $135 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 25%, 200 basis points ahead of the high end of our prior guidance and marking the third consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins. These results demonstrate our ability to drive revenue growth while efficiently managing costs with second quarter adjusted expense of $398 million, up only 9% year-over-year and down sequentially. We continue to manage expense growth primarily by driving leverage in G&A, capitalizing on cloud efficiencies and calibrating our headcount investments in key strategic areas of growth. Consistent with prior years, we expect to see an increase in expenses in the third quarter as we onboard our new grad cohort of world-class technical talent. As we have stated over the past few quarters, we are fiercely committed to sustained GAAP profitability. On the back of three consecutive quarters of GAAP net income and expanding operating margins, we are increasing investments and resources dedicated to our new product, AIP, while at the same time, increasing our full year adjusted income from operations guidance to an excess of $576 million, an increase of $45 million above the midpoint of our prior range. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we remain focused on calibrating expense growth below revenue growth, even as we increase investment and resourcing to AIP and invest in specific geographies around the world. We generated income from operations of $10 million, our second consecutive quarter of GAAP operating income. We continue to manage our stock-based compensation. As mentioned last quarter, we expect it to trend up through the back half of the year. However, we remain laser focused on GAAP net income and operating profitability. As we think about equity compensation and aligning it to shareholder value, we are in the process of linking future employee equity compensation to the success of AIP. Turning to net income. GAAP net income was $28 million, our third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.05 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.01. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin was 38%. We expect to return to executing in access of the Rule of 40 for the second half of the year. Turning to our cash flow. We generated $96 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a margin of 18% and $90 million in cash from operations, representing a margin of 17%. Through the first half of the year, we generated $285 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a margin of 27%. We ended the second quarter with $3.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. treasury bills. We retain access to additional liquidity of up to $500 million through our revolving credit facility, which remains entirely undrawn. Now turning to our outlook. For Q3 2023, we expect revenue of between $553 million and $557 million, adjusted income from operations of between $135 million and $139 million and GAAP net income. For full year 2023, we are raising our revenue guidance to an excess of $2.212 billion. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to an excess of $576 million and we continue to expect GAAP net income in each quarter. On the back of our third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability, $285 million in adjusted free cash flow in the first half of the year and over $3.1 billion on our balance sheet, our Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $1 billion. This program reflects our conviction in the trajectory of our business and the value we see in our stock. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ana to start the Q&A. A - Ana Soro : Thanks, Dave. We\u2019ll begin with a few questions from our shareholders before we open up the call. Our first question is from Gaurav [ph] who asks, what are some of the AI advantages Palantir has that none of the other companies can compete with? Shyam Sankar : I\u2019ll take that one. The Palantir is optimally positioned for AI, because the value is going to accrete to the incumbents. It\u2019s going to accrete to the people who own the workflow, who own the software. So, in our case, it\u2019s not just the customers that we do have today. It\u2019s our ability to acquire future customers. It\u2019s the 20 years of experience that we have solving the problems that matter. The problems that you should be solving with LLMs haven\u2019t changed. The same problem you should be solving before you had LLM and the two decades of experience we have and the knowledge of applying it means that we can solve those problems substantially more quickly. In other words, we\u2019ve built the infrastructure you really need for LMs to be valuable in your enterprise, if you want to write profits and not poems with them. And I think one way you can think about this is, LLM and Excel, like the LLM are going to make Excel more valuable and useful. They\u2019re not going to replace Excel. The LLMs that we\u2019ve been building with our customers in the field in the last 10 weeks, I\u2019ve been out there with our customers, we deployed over 15 copilots. The time to value here is truly incredible. It\u2019s accelerating everything that we\u2019ve been doing here. So I feel really good about the positioning there. And because we\u2019ve been roughly two decades ahead, it\u2019s given us a lot of lead to think about the next ridge line of technical problems, a lot of which I hope to share at AIPCon(2). But to preview one of them, it\u2019s really the KLM kernel. I talked earlier in the remarks about how LLMs are statistics, not calculus. They\u2019re like these stochastic mad scientists. Why on earth would you ask a question of one LLM, when you going to ask KLLMs. And I think that really honors the fundamental reality that you need a committee here, that there isn\u2019t an answer to this stochastic question, there are answers, especially when you don\u2019t have priors. And you can use this to actually wheel these LLMs for decisive operational advantage in the enterprise when you have this sort of framework. So stay tuned till September, AIPCon(2), we\u2019ll talk more about this. Ana Soro : Thanks, Shyam. Our next question is from Patrick [ph] who asks, how is the use of AI and LLMs benefited the sales cycle? Are you finding less resistance from internal IT departments? Has it brought more awareness to Palantir products and solutions? Ryan Taylor : Great. Thanks, Patrick. So, as I mentioned, we launched AIP just 10 weeks ago. We\u2019re already seeing unprecedented interest both from top of funnel new customers and from existing customers who are looking to expand with the AIP offering. You\u2019ve heard examples of very real momentum and engagement and impact we\u2019re having with it from Jacobs Engineering, J.D. Powers, Novartis, among others, to name a few. And what we\u2019re seeing is with the emergence of LMMs AI capabilities, operators and organizations are looking at ways to deploy those within their organizations effectively against their missions and do so safely and securely and we are that solution. We have the product to do that, and we have 20 years of experience deploying our products in the enterprise and being able to do that safely and securely. So while sometimes in the past, we may have had misalignment with IT departments, now we\u2019re fully aligned with what they\u2019re trying to achieve. So in short, we\u2019re seeing sales cycles shorten. We\u2019re expecting that to continue and accelerate and we\u2019re going to run at that full speed. Alex Karp : And look, we -- especially in the U.S. market, we were -- for a lot of reasons misaligned with our clients. We had built products both Foundry and the ontology branching and lots of ideas of how to manage large-scale data sets and then algorithm classified setting. But in reality, there was a resistance to how we believe an enterprise should work. And if you look at what Shyam is saying and what Ryan is saying, what you\u2019re really seeing is American industry now has done five, six iterations, often with thin technologies, with thick sales forces that kind of have been supported by the venture capital community, and quite frankly, by analysts looking for models they understood. We built a company that no one understood. We went deep on technology, that\u2019s Foundry. We went deep on the logical extension of that, which is all these precursor technologies that we\u2019ve now begun building into AIP. And that -- we went deep against the playbook, and in fact, the playbook now does not exist, the playbook that is being built looks exactly like the products that are a reflection of our culture. And that\u2019s just an insurmountable advantage and we are very focused on taking advantage of it. Ana Soro : Thanks, Ryan and Alex. Our next question is from Emo [ph] who asks, how are you balancing investments for long-term growth, while also delivering the profit and performance needed to keep shareholders confident and invested? Dave Glazer : I\u2019ll take that\u2026 Alex Karp : We are. Dave Glazer : Yeah. We are. Thanks, Emo. And I think one example of this is, we delivered on GAAP profitability two issues before people thought it was coming. And then if you look to the last three quarters, we have three consecutive quarters of GAAP profitability. We\u2019ve now guided to Q3 and Q4 of GAAP profitability. We\u2019re here with $3.1 billion on the balance sheet and we\u2019re doing this all while we\u2019re investing heavily in AIP. And we\u2019re really doing that across the company, both with money, both through resources and we\u2019re very focused on. Alex Karp : Well, I mean, we delivered profitability years ahead of time. Why do we care about profitability? We care about profitability because we power some of the most important enterprises in the world. They care that we\u2019re on steady footing. We care about it because it shows people that we are serious. We care about it because it positions us to be on indexes like the S&P that show that we are one of the leading industries in the world. We believe in ourselves, which is why we\u2019ve authorized a buyback to align with this belief in ourselves, our belief of profitability aligns with our desire to be on the S&P. We are going to invest in ourselves and not at a small scale in the lot $1 billion range. And so, profitability, stability, move to S&P, move to a company that is reflects what we will be, which we believe is the most important enterprise software company in the world and these are all very much linked. Ana Soro : Thank you both. Our next question is from Jesse [ph] who asks, I know you guys are pushing for 5% of defense spending to go to software. How has this been received by policymakers in the defense community? Alex Karp : We spend a lot of time talking to various parts of the U.S. and allied defense communities. And there\u2019s, quite frankly, a varied views on this. Our view is software that\u2019s actually used for important purposes, both commercial and non-commercial has certain attributes. Most likely built in America, it\u2019s most like -- it is built in the product -- the context of a product and it\u2019s been sold commercially. It is imperative for our country to move to a rebuttable presumption that the institutions that defend us by a certain portion of software that is a product more likely than not built in America, and that somebody has actually bought it besides some large program. And it\u2019s surprising how many people agree with us. We\u2019re a long way off from getting this done. But as our adversaries become more aggressive, as people come to terms with the fact that many of the things they may have learned in college that we\u2019re going to all regress to a state of loving one another are not coming to pass, and in fact, our adversaries view that as a laughable ferry tail that we believe in at our own expense people are getting more serious. When people get more serious, they stop wanting fantasies, about how you build software fantasies, about how you implement fantasies about, you\u2019re going to hire 10,000 people and give it to somebody that a company that\u2019s never built a product that\u2019s ever worked. And they -- but is that happening fast enough? No. Luckily for us, and hopefully, for our country and the West, people are getting much more serious just because of events that you see happening around us. If you have any additions? Ryan Taylor : No. Well said. Ana Soro : Thanks, Alex. Our next question is from Josh Mark [ph], who asks what\u2019s the latest and potential S&P 500 inclusion? Shyam Sankar : The latest is we expect to be eligible after we report Q3 and so we\u2019re proud to say we\u2019re less than a quarter away. Dave Glazer : From eligibility. Shyam Sankar : From eligibility. Ana Soro : Thanks, Dave. Our next question is from Sony [ph], who asks, can you elaborate on current capital allocation priorities? Dave Glazer : Absolutely. So, Sony, we\u2019ve delivered three consecutive quarters of GAAP profitability. Looking at the first half of the year, $285 million in adjusted free cash flow, close to almost $1 billion since we\u2019ve gone public. AIP is going to be transformative. You\u2019ve talked -- you\u2019ve heard Alex talk about the scale that we think is going to be. We\u2019ve talked about reorienting the company around it, earlier I spoke about how we\u2019re orienting our compensation about it. You combine that GAAP profitability, strong cash flow, AIP, the Board just authorized a $1 billion stock buyback, which aligns with our goal of S&P 500 inclusion. Alex Karp : We are very focused on investing in ourselves. It is -- we are not as focused on acquiring other companies. We believe we have the right products and/or we will build them. So we are investing in what we do, what we believe are the best in the world, very little interest in products we see on the market. And so it\u2019s really an investment in ourselves and our talent through changing the compensation and our ability to retain people by making sure we\u2019re focused on a mission that is crazy important to us in the world in showing our belief with actual real attendees and running like hell. Ana Soro : Thank you both. Our next question is from Dan with Wedbush. Dan, please turn on your camera and then you receive prompt to unmute your line. Alex Karp : Hello? Dan Ives : Yeah. Thank you. So a great call and just a phenomenal insight that you provided. I guess my question would be, when it comes to AIP, what surprised you, Alex and the team, in another words, the last 10 weeks, has it surprised you just what we\u2019ve seen from customers just how dramatic the sort of surge interest has been? Alex Karp : Shyam should also talk about this, but what has very much surprised me is the way in which American institutions have metabolized the lessons of the last software wave. So they have a much deeper understanding of what the problem would be that you would solve and the operators. So the people actually running the business in America realized the determinant variable for changing their margins, changing their profit and outmaneuvering their competition is AI.  And so then you have the dynamic with the Board. The Board is insisting on governance. The operators are insisting on adoption. And this is very, very different than anything I\u2019ve ever seen. Typically, with software intervention from the outside, you\u2019ve got to convince the CIO, the Board doesn\u2019t care and the operator is focused on business metrics. Here, the operators are saying, I know, for example, I was dealing with a large -- I was talking to one of the largest transporters of people in the world, and the operator is saying, okay, I know we have a problem with churn. I know we have a problem with logistics. These problems can only be solved algorithmatically, but I can\u2019t solve them unless I have a governance structure that allows me to solve them, because my Board will go nuts. That is basically a shape of a problem only we can solve and this is happening all over America, various problems like this. I\u2019ll give you another example. One of the advantages of AI is that, if you want to do manufacturing, so you want to do Japanese manufacturing in America, you\u2019re actually having to use Japanese methodologies with American workers. Share the force [ph] is not impossible. AI can actually allow you to manage the internal dynamics of your workforce so that you get the Japanese culture with American workers in the U.S. And this is just absolutely game-changing for our country. And why is it that -- now there are other countries, but Europe here is really going to struggle, but other countries, why is this game shaming particularly for America? Because it allows us to do manufacturing at a level we typically could not do in use cases that we were not good at. It allows us to change the margins. It allows us to do it safely. It realigns the institution. So now the IT person, the operator and the CEO are very focused on a use case that will change the share price. It\u2019s very unusual for institutions to be fully aligned unless someone\u2019s shooting at you. So the only institutions I\u2019ve ever seen that are fully aligned, literally someone is shooting at you. And even then, the IT person is often like, well, why can\u2019t I buy this from my cousins. It\u2019s -- and literally, the special operator kicks the IT. So this is a completely different moment. And then I\u2019ll say something else, typically, this moment would be captured by non-incumbents, people early-stage -- early-stage companies. But the market is moving too quickly. The barriers to get inside these companies are still there. And then the other incumbents, some of them are very interesting, but most of them just don\u2019t build products. They do not -- they are companies with thin -- beautiful companies, they do things we can\u2019t do, but they don\u2019t really have many engineers. The engineers have been there for 50 years. They have huge sales forces. They cannot build something that\u2019s relevant and if they could, it\u2019s going to take years and there\u2019s nothing to acquire. We\u2019re not for sale. Shyam Sankar : And on the ground working with customers, I would just add that, the ambition has gone way up. People expect this offer to work. They -- so they -- what do I expect of the software I\u2019m getting from my IT organization has gone up and then the ambition of their own use cases. What do I want to accomplish with the software\u2019s gone way up, so that\u2019s created a lot of white space to go after? And then when you can deliver 15 copilots in nine weeks, it\u2019s -- you just get so much more pull on that. The other part that\u2019s been rewarding is like, we no longer spend time talking about why do you need ontology. We don\u2019t even have to use that word anymore, because it\u2019s intuitive, it\u2019s obvious, the infrastructure we\u2019ve built and how that enables you to actually accomplish these ambitious use cases. So it\u2019s just been a huge tailwind for us. Ana Soro : Thanks, Alex and Shyam. Our next question is from Mariana with Bank of America. Mariana, please turn on your camera and then you will receive a prompt to unmute your line. Mariana Perez Mora : Good afternoon, everyone. Alex Karp : Very nice to see you. Mariana Perez Mora : So my question is going to be about AIP. You mentioned more than 100 organizations using it right now. How are you thinking about ratio and timing of commercial? And second, on the other conversations we\u2019re having with, like, 300-plus organizations. How many of those are willing to use it on a Foundry platform versus the old? Alex Karp : Do you want to take this? Shyam Sankar : Sure. So the... Alex Karp : Another way, it\u2019s a pleasure to see you. Mariana Perez Mora : Finally. Shyam Sankar : We\u2019re in the phase right now where we\u2019re very focused on driving compounding usage of this. It\u2019s like, we\u2019ve done this with Gotham, we\u2019ve done this with Gaia, with Foundry, with Apollo. And what we\u2019re excited to see is that, we have over 5,000 monthly users. The users are growing 50% month-over-month. Obviously, we\u2019ve been doing this for 10 weeks now. That\u2019s quite a bit in the enterprise for the pace that we\u2019re going at here. I think let\u2019s look and see what happens in the next few months here, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be too long to kind of turn that corner. What was -- can you remind me the second part of your question? Alex Karp : The way -- people don\u2019t have Foundry, how does that look? Shyam Sankar : Oh! I think the real focus on the AIP product strategy is to make sure that you can use AIP without Gotham, Foundry or Apollo. And that to the extent you see the value in these things, you\u2019re going to pull them along with you. Now I think that\u2019s where ontology has been most useful in both context. We\u2019ve deployed operational workflows on classified networks using this technology in real-world exercises, that\u2019s only accomplishable, because they\u2019re standing on a decade of this well ontologized data and the kind of enterprise tools that they have for war fighting to accomplish those use cases. So when you look at the time to value, it helps them solve for their use case. The other part that I would point out is, people then see the value of bringing their own tools to bear. When I think about the work we\u2019re doing with pharma companies and many of the AI models that they\u2019ve already built, this actually helps them close that last-mile, where they feel like, look, we have these exquisite models. We have these libraries. How do we actually connect it to the business case of driving drug development more quickly? And then you see these sort of hybrid architectures emerging where you have AIP, you have Foundry, you have their homegrown systems, working quite harmoniously against the ambitious problem and so I think that\u2019s been pretty productive. And I think the good part about this, because it\u2019s so generative right now is that, there is no reference architecture. You\u2019re not getting caught up in kind of academic questions of how should we design this thing. People are forging that and figuring that out relative to what works and delivers value. Alex Karp : Let me just riff on that a little bit. We built this original project -- product, our first product guys off the ground made us famous in a very small market called clandestine services. And that project or product PG did something really interesting. It de facto taught the world what the use case is that you would need to solve and then provided the product that solved it. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing with AIP. So you do have an advantage if you already have Foundry, because we\u2019ve already kind of pre-taught you where the road is going to go. But right now, to Shyam\u2019s point and point I made earlier, there is no roadmap. The product is actually teaching people what the roadmap would look like. That doesn\u2019t mean everyone will buy AIP, by the way. So a lot of people say, okay, well, I need these 15 things. I need what Shyam\u2019s calling intelligence the ability to interact with the LLM. I need an ability to take that out and turn it into Logic. I need an ability to run that on my enterprise safely. I need all these things and I want to spend some -- some people are going to say, I want to spend $500 million building that because I want to own it. A lot of those people will fail, some will succeed. A lot of the other people will buy it from Palantir, but we are de facto teaching people the, quote-unquote, roadmap of the way the world will look and the problems you have to solve and it teaches them, because you can show it live in action. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going on in the market and that gets to when we actually monetize this, we will monetize. Palantir is guilty of many things. People think they thought we were insane. Some people think I\u2019m eclectic, some analysts think that I am talking something they\u2019ve never heard of, right, often right. We have no problem monetizing. We make $2.9 million per commercial customer across the world. We will figure out how to monetize it. First, we\u2019re teaching the market what it is. We\u2019re getting people on Board. We\u2019re showing people that these are the kind of problems you have to solve if you want to engage in actually making money as opposed to writing net poetry that may be scary to your enterprise and your Board won\u2019t let you install anyway and then we will allow people then we will charge for that. Ana Soro : Thank you both. Alex, as always, we have a lot of investors on the line. Are there any other thoughts you\u2019d like to share before we end the call? Alex Karp : Well, as usual, I\u2019d like to thank our -- many of our supporters, our clients who\u2019ve seen this transformation and supported it, who are adopting AIP. The Palantirion team, which goes through the vilcistitudes of our ships and now is fully aligned on building AIP. Our retail investors who I think have been way ahead of everyone else in understanding the product, actually testing it, looking at it, calling customers, and in general, the spirit of American innovation from which we are profiting and thank you for your time. Ana Soro : Thanks, Alex. That concludes Q&A for today\u2019s call.",

We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued before the market opened and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 results. Management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed before the market opened today, and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures, is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call. Ryan Taylor : We are pleased to report that our company achieved GAAP profitability for the fourth consecutive quarter, and we continue to drive strong results across our company. In Q3, we closed 80 deals of $1 million or more across 30 industries, 29 deals of $5 million or more across 16 industries, and 12 deals of $10 million or more across 11 industries. Our U.S. commercial business accelerated last quarter, growing 33% year-over-year. Excluding strategic commercial contracts, it grew 52% year-over-year and 19% sequentially, and three-fourths of our quarter-over-quarter growth is from customers that started with us in 2023. Our U.S. commercial customer count rose 12% quarter-over-quarter and is now ten-fold what it was just three years ago. Deal count for our U.S. commercial business is 2.4x what it was in Q3 of last year and U.S. commercial TCV closed at $252 million, up 55% year-over-year on a dollar-weighted duration basis. We're also seeing the acceleration of larger deals and shorter times to conversion and expansion, including a multiyear deal in excess of $40 million with one of the largest home construction companies in the U.S. to start up pilot and converted all within Q3. This growth is in part due to AIP's continued transformation of the way we partner with and deliver value for our customers, and we expect AIP's impact to continue to intensify. The rapid expansion of AIP at both our existing and new customers, and the impact it is having on their operations is nothing short of remarkable. In the last quarter, we reoriented our go-to-market approach around AIP boot camps, which has allowed us to deliver real workflows on actual customer data in five days or less versus our traditional pilots, which generally take one to three months. We're seeing different stakeholders at the table, including tangible engagement from IT, a quicker time to value for customers, a wider range of organizations partnering with us and the ability to have multi-organization boot camps. Early indications point to vast improvements on our unit economics from initial contact to customer conversion, all while accelerating new customer negotiations. Boot camps are also driving contract expansions. We're on track to conduct boot camps for more than 140 organizations by the end of November, nearly half of those are taking place this month alone, which is more than the number of U.S. commercial pilots we conducted all of last year. In these boot camps, our customers attack problems that have immediate impact and learn how to deploy AI into their unique operating environment in a matter of days. Our customers' results speak for themselves. One attendee said that we achieved more in one day for them with AIP than one of the top three hyperscalers had accomplished over the last four months, and then presented their work with Palantir instead of the hyperscaler to the CEO the very next day. Another attendee said, we basically built 10x faster with 3x less resources, and yet another claimed, we have built in a day what they wouldn't be able to get internally in months, and then it probably still wouldn't meet the requirements. AIP is being used for a multitude of workflows at customers across the globe. Just a few examples include the following : our partners in the health care space, including Tampa General, HCA and Cleveland Clinic, are using AIP for dynamic scheduling, turning software from a place of data entry into a provider of operating leverage. Aramark is using AI to procure more efficiently, generating custom proactive negotiating strategies. Panasonic North America is using AIP to scale its workforce and accelerate how quickly new engineers can level up. Eaton is using AIP to more efficiently deploy fixes by identifying available materials across different plants or assembly patterns. Carrefour Brazil is increasing the fill rate of online grocery orders with higher accuracy. The energy and engagement around AIP is unlike anything we've ever seen. The potential market for AIP and the trajectory of possible AIP growth for our business is massive. We almost tripled the number of AIP users last quarter and nearly 300 distinct organizations have used AIP since our launch just five months ago. We will continue investing meaningfully in boot camps as our go-to-market strategy for AIP. Through all of this, we never forget that we are a company built on a foundation of counterterrorism. In response to recent world events, we continue to be dedicated to our founding principles of supporting the most important missions in the world, including providing intelligence and defense capabilities to global allies. In that vein, our impact has never been more compelling. We have the products now that the world needs. We expect our U.S. government business to reaccelerate beyond the current growth rate of 10% year-over-year, given increasing demand for those products to support our allies around the world. While we continue to expect near-term uncertainty given budgetary environments, we were encouraged by the pickup in activity at the end of the U.S. government fiscal year, and we feel well positioned for long-term growth through our evolving strategy, which Sean will speak to further. Just several weeks ago, it was announced that the Army awarded us a new contract worth up to $250 million over three years to provide additional capabilities in support of COCOMs, armed services, intelligence community and special forces as they continue to test, utilize and scale AI and ML capabilities. As we enter the final months of the year, we are steadfast in our focus on AI and unlocking the impact it can have for our customers. We look forward to continued business momentum through year-end and are excited for the opportunities to continue delivering unmatched impact for our customers into the new year. I'll now turn it over to Shyam. Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Ryan. At AIPCon 2, this past September, I unpack some of the foundational engineering challenges that we've solved to deploy LLMs that are anchored in your data on your private network and to safely orchestrate your enterprise with tools, actions and other AI models. The core concept of the KLLM kernel enables you to reliably harness LLMs for critical workflows to manage the risks in the underlying models changing out from underneath you and to create the shortest and safest path to put your own fine-tuned models into production. Why use one LLM when you can use K? The art is in synthesizing the outputs from this committee of experts to create a rich topology of answers to the prompt. LLMs are statistics, not calculus. It's more like predicting the weather than predicting an eclipse. And that's why we're focused on proof, not proofs of concept. AIP gives our customers the infrastructure they actually need to ship production use cases quickly. This difference has been so profound that we shifted the entire commercial organization to focus on one to five-day long customer boot camps, where organizations exit with a scalable use case on their actual data that they built for themselves. Customers leave so excited with this definite optimistic view of what can be accomplished, and how they'll drive transformation in their organizations. And these boot camps have created enormous tailwinds with IT attendees for two reasons. First, we're defining the most advanced and valuable reference architecture for GenAI in the enterprise. And second, with the release of virtual tables and foundry, IT's primary objection of data duplication is eliminated. We're running more boot camps per month than we had U.S. commercial pilots all last year. These boot camps really allow the customer to experience three magic moments for themselves. First, that you really can't use LLMs without tools. That elegant integration of algorithmic reasoning to unlock the full potential. Second, that the object, in other words, the rich representation of your enterprise and its state and not chat is the prompt, or said differently, the Boot Camp experience enables them to transcend chat. And finally, the power of live integration of expert feedback through the AIP infrastructure to efficiently generate adaptive models. At the end of the boot camp, customers say things like, once you see it, you can't unsee it. As Ryan mentioned, it's common to hear attendees express that they could do in days what they couldn't previously with other AI technologies and months. In September, we also launched Palantir Government Web Services to expand Palantir's mission by supporting and growing today's nascent but inspiring defense tech ecosystem. Through Palantir GWS, we're providing emerging and existing companies in the defense industrial base with the enabling software to quickly operationalize their mission-critical capabilities at scale, all aimed at minimizing the value of death and bringing the best of America's greatest advantage software to the fight. FedStart and Apollo are the first offerings in GWS. FedStarts platform accreditation as a service offering radically compresses the timeline and cost of unlocking IL-5 markets and beyond. Apollo's autonomous software delivery platform is the most technically mature and sophisticated approach to continuously delivering complex modern software to the thousands of edge environments required to deter and defeat threats in the Pacific. FedStart customers like CalypsoAI and PrimerAI and Apollo customers like Lockheed shared their acceleration journeys at our software for government conference hosted in our DC offices in September. The reaction to Palantir GWS has been amazing. VCs, defense tech entrepreneurs and government PMs are responding to the investments in a big tent ecosystem and the efficiency and scale that we're providing. We also launched our mixed reality service and immersive C2, an application that was built on the mixed reality service at the Army's AUSA Conference in October. It was met with rave reviews. Our immersive C2 application showed how command and control could be done on the move in the back of a vehicle, leveraging mixed-reality headsets built on GWS infrastructure. And our mixed reality service will mean that any application that builds on or integrates with GWS can instantly enable their own mixed reality offering. Finally, our products could not be playing a more central role for real-world events. It's incredibly rewarding to see the products that we've built over the last 20 years meet their moments, often in new and impactful ways. From MetaConstellation, which is enabling tactical overhead imagery in the field, to guide for mission planning, to even foundry for complex video imagery and audio analysis and automation. From the mission data platform and its real-time cross-domain collaboration across allied nations to MAVERICK for target effect repairing and advanced fires execution. These real-world events validate the investments that we have made over the last five years, and strengthens our conviction in what we are building now for the future. And with that, I'll hand it over to Dave to talk us through the financials. David Glazer : Thanks, Shyam. We had an exceptional quarter. Revenue growth reaccelerated on the back of our U.S. commercial business, driven by our intense focus on AIP, while margins continue to expand, demonstrating the transforming unit economics of our business. We beat the high end of our guidance range on both top line and bottom line and increased our Rule of 40 score 800 basis points (ph) quarter-over-quarter to 46, while simultaneously delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability, the first time ever that we are GAAP profitable on a trailing 12-month basis. We also delivered our third consecutive quarter of GAAP operating profit and over $0.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow over the last four quarters. Turning to our global top line results. Third quarter revenue reaccelerated to $558 million, up 17% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, exceeding the high end of the range of our prior guidance. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, third quarter revenue grew 21% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. Trailing 12-month revenue per customer from our top 20 customers increased 13% year-over-year to $54 million per customer. Customer count grew 34% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to 453 customers as we remain focused on landing new accounts. Now moving to our commercial segment. Third quarter commercial revenue grew 23% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $251 million. I'd like to congratulate the entire commercial org for reaching a $1 billion annualized run rate milestone this quarter. It's quite an achievement. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, commercial revenue grew 34% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. In the third quarter, U.S. commercial revenue reaccelerated to $116 million, up 33% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, U.S. commercial revenue grew 52% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. We continue to see the impact of our intense focus on AIP on our commercial business, both through the adoption of new customers and the expansion of opportunities at existing customers. We booked $252 million of U.S. commercial TCV, representing growth of 55% year-over-year on a dollar-weighted duration basis. Our U.S. commercial customer count grew to 181 customers, reflecting 37% growth year-over-year and 12% sequentially, benefiting from the increase in velocity of our AIP go-to-market motion. This represents a ten-fold increase in U.S. commercial customer count from when we went public just 3 years ago. Our international commercial business was up 15% year-over-year and 4% sequentially to $134 million as we continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East and beyond, while conditions remain challenging in Continental Europe. Revenue from strategic commercial contracts was $15 million or 2.6% of quarterly revenue, down from $19 million in the prior quarter. We anticipate fourth quarter revenue from these customers to continue to decline to between $13 million to $15 million, representing 2.3% of expected fourth quarter revenue. Shifting to our Government segment. Third quarter government revenue grew 12% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to $308 million. U.S. government revenue grew 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to $229 million. While it's hard to predict exactly when our government revenue will reconverge at historically high CAGRs, as Shyam mentioned, our products, PG, GAIA, MetaConstellation and AIP are needed in battlefields across the world and even more so in the current geopolitical landscape. International government revenue grew 21% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to $78 million, bolstered by our continued work in health care and defense. Moving to bookings. TCV booked was $830 million, up 29% sequentially. Net dollar retention was 107%, impacted primarily by headwinds from our commercial business in Continental Europe. Net dollar retention does not include revenue from new customers that we acquired in the past 12 months and is, therefore, not reflective of the recent acceleration in our U.S. commercial business. We ended the third quarter with $3.7 billion in total remaining deal value and $988 million in remaining performance obligations. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business. Our U.S. commercial business saw total remaining deal value growth of 23% year-over-year and 27% sequentially when excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts highlighting the acceleration of our go-to-market motion. Turning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense was 82% for the quarter. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes was $163 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 29%, 400 basis points ahead of the high end of our prior guidance, and marking the fourth consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins. Q3 adjusted expense was $395 million, down 1% sequentially and flat year-over-year. In short, we've been able to flatline expenses for four consecutive quarters while investing significantly in our products, including AIP and reaccelerating our revenue. This drives home the efficiency and operating leverage of our software at scale. R&D adjusted expense was up 9% year-over-year and 11% sequentially, demonstrating our commitment to continuously drive forward product innovation and invest in technical talent. Over the past year, we have emphasized our unwavering dedication to sustain GAAP profitability and GAAP operating income. Our four consecutive quarters of improving GAAP operating income enable us to more aggressively invest in AIP. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and beyond, we remain focused on calibrating expense growth below revenue growth, even as we increase investment and resourcing to AIP and in specific geographies around the world. In the third quarter, we generated GAAP operating income of $40 million, our third consecutive quarter of GAAP operating income. We also generated GAAP net income of $72 million, representing a 13% margin, our fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. This is the first time we've ever achieved both GAAP net income and GAAP operating profitability on a trailing 12-month basis. While we continue to manage our stock-based compensation expense, as I mentioned in previous quarters, we expect it to trend up in Q4 as we continue to invest in AIP. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.07 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.03. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 46%, an 800 basis point increase to a Rule of 40 score from the prior quarter. We will strive to maintain this exceptional balance of top and bottom line performance. Turning to our cash flow. In the third quarter, we generated $141 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a margin of 25%, and $133 million in cash from operations, representing a margin of 24%. Over the past four quarters, we've generated $490 million in cash flow from operations and $502 million in adjusted free cash flow, marking the first time we've exceeded $0.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. We ended Q3 with $3.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. treasury bills. We retain access to additional liquidity of up to $500 million through our revolving credit facility, which remains entirely undrawn. Now turning to our outlook. For Q4 2023, we expect revenue of between $599 million and $603 million, adjusted income from operations of between $184 million and $188 million and GAAP net income. For full year 2023, we are raising our revenue guidance to between $2.216 billion and $2.22 billion. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to between $607 million and $611 million and we continue to expect GAAP net income in each quarter of this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks. Alex Karp : Welcome. I don't think the camera is working. Welcome to our earnings. Obviously, current events and the performance of our business are absolute validation of our strategy of building the world's most aligned and powerful enterprise products years, sometimes decades before they're needed before you could imagine their power. AIP and U.S. commercial, not only is disrupting the market, it's setting a standard that I don't believe any other software company will be able to reach partly because they misunderstood the value of LLMs and their relative importance and lack of importance, partly because they don't have decades of experience on the frontline as we do in the military with managing the core ways in which you make these things precise, the way in which you provide governance. Also because the playbook backed by venture capitalists and supported by analysts has always been make the thinnest technology possible that is misaligned with your enterprise and hire the most and best salespeople so the enterprise gets moderate value while having its high revenue exported in a parasitic manner to the cheers of insiders and the pain of retail investors and we obviously rejected that. And then on the mission side, we have been saying and building products for a world that is violent, disjointed, irrational, a world in which you have to show strength, a world in which, if you do not show strength, people who are biased, xenophobic, dare I say any somatic will rear their head. A world in which you really have to pick sides. Palantir is the first major company to in my view to have said from the beginning, I think that is obviously true. There is no such thing anymore of being on all sides. Palantir only supplies its products to Western allies. We've never supplied our products to enemies. We proudly support the U.S. government. I am proud that we are supporting Israel in every way we can. And we also support plain English speaking. So when people are massacre to the equivalent of almost 50,000 people in Israel, we view it as a terror act. We call it terrorism. We supply our product to people who're fighting terrorism, and we have no problem with describing as it is or sticking up for our allies and we don't provide false context. All of a sudden, you need a lot of context for describing what it means to kill Jews or persecute jews across the world. I believe, in context and we -- in places where you need to actually provide it. But at Palantir, we have seen that our view of the world which is that there really are people that are violent and not in conformant with morality need to be fought. And we are supplying these products that we've built over the last 20 years to our allies, and we are proud of the results. And I would say -- also, even commercially, you are going to see that our alignment with our client, our alignment with our society pays major dividends. And for those of you who are along for the ride, we really celebrate you. And we are going to bring our warrior culture to our products, to our market fit and the results of which we are going to bring to our allies. A - Ana Soro : With that, we'll begin with a few questions from our shareholders before we open up the call. Our first question is from Christopher. The current situation in Israel has opened the eyes of other allied countries around the globe, specifically, are there current or future plans supporting our allied partners in Asia with Palantir products? Shyam Sankar : Absolutely. The short answer is yes. I think not only can we look at Israel, but we can look even before that at Ukraine and the lessons that we've learned there. And I would distill that down simply to that you must preposition data, software and hardware well ahead of the fight there and create a partner mesh network of command and control nodes to really provide a difference here. So that's one major thing. And so we're spending a lot of our time on our energy thinking about how do we get as much mass west of the international dateline as possible to be prepared to meet those moments. And make no mistake, there's a lot to be done there. The other lesson specific from Israel is how much faster you can move when you create a big tent tech ecosystem that allows you to bring a lot of other defense tech start-ups along with you. The capabilities that we were able to give the Israeli government by bringing in other Israeli startups as well as international start-ups was incredible. And that's a key lesson that we're taking forward with us as well. And it's embodied and enabled by Palantir government web services. Ana Soro : Thanks, Shyam. Our next question is from Sony. Congrats on well executed AI bots delivering tangible value very quickly. Could you kindly attempt to synthesize the top three observations from those boot camps for enterprises to launch AI-enabled decision management systems to power forward their critical objectives? Shyam Sankar : Sure. I'll take a first stab at this. I would say, one, it's about the magic moments. So the first bit of this that I think people get out of is, what does this really mean to understand that you can't really use these LLM without tools? So how do you bring that tool bench forward? Two, it's a realization that the semantics of your business ought to be the prompt. And we are uniquely positioned there because the best way to do that is to serialize those semantics into your oncology to use the object model that we have to do that. And so getting... Alex Karp : We've already built and deployed. One of the most interesting things about the commercial market is there are all these tools we built that basically not only allow you to manage LLMs, but they are -- they basically pen test your enterprise. So always de facto what in the past where you were selling was misaligned with your enterprise. AI forces an alignment with your enterprise. And so you begin to ask really business relevant questions. And then because of essentially our ability to take the knowledge of your business and put it into the LLM and then extract from the LLM something relevant and then manage it, you get both the power of the LLM and you get the shock movement of the enterprise actually saying, wait a minute, you're providing me something that actually is good for my enterprise. Quite frankly, it's almost like taking an alcoholic off alcohol and saying here's your health drink. And it's like -- and the reason why it just is very, very hard to compete against that is because the other players in this space are actually built to take you away from what is good for your enterprise. How do you make better margins? How do you make your products more safer? How do you take the task at knowledge of a Japanese manufacturing company and build in America with all the advantages of America and the tasset knowledge of Japanese manufacturing. That's what we're actually doing with these things. And then there's all these things we've built that would take decades, years and years and years to build, even if you understood them, that we'd already built. Shyam Sankar : And to add on to that, the Japanese example shows it. I think the third major magic moment that's impactful there is this incorporation of real-time expert feedback and thinking about feedback as data type unto itself. Not having to retrain or upgrade the parametric knowledge of the model, but actually being able to use feedback dynamically live to create an adaptive model. Alex Karp : And then -- and I'm sure Ryan will talk about this, the scale function of this. It's like one of the logical question is, is if you're doing well, why are you so happy that you have $40 million in operating income. Well, it's because the unit economics are so good moving from boot camp from pilots it took six months to boot camps to take officially two days, I was in one that took 6 hours, are so efficient, we don't -- it's like we're just -- we're like -- there's a limit to how much resources we can pour into this. So we're like doing all these things, and we're educating people and we're doing it at scale that is equivalent to already one month as much as we did all year last year. Ryan Taylor : Yeah. And with our relentless execution, we're seeing the ability and how much easier it is lowering the barrier for customers to see our product applied against their data in real workflows. And so we're seeing the network effects of that. We're seeing customers who have used AIP in one context, going to new companies, adopting it at new companies and converting quickly. We're seeing customers that were with us years ago who are coming back to us because we have the product now that works for what they need. And we're seeing that in a way where they may be tried to build themselves and failed, and they're now able to implement it effectively and quickly in that environment and the vast kind of expansion and advancements of our products are showing that... Alex Karp : And one of the things that -- I mean, I'm very bullish on the U.S. and, quite frankly, a little bit less bullish on every place else. But one of the things that's amazing about the U.S. is, people change jobs and people know how good our product is. In the minute they change their job, they call us. And some of the results if you disambiguate and normalize the results to take out packs, U.S. grew -- is growing 52% -- 52% off of a large base, which is why I think we can accelerate it to a $1 billion run rate by '25. But it's because the how dynamic America is and people moving around, taking the product, combined with our ability to execute in a new commercial motion that is just literally a game changer for how we go to market. And by the way, we always kind of neglect to mention this. It's also a game changer internally. Like culturally right now, partly because we're on the frontline fighting what amounts to Evil, partly because a lot of people don't agree with us and those that do realize that they need to stand up and stand with us, and partly because we were right about what you should supply to U.S. commercial, it's just a really good value internally. It is just -- it's like we're really -- it's really fun to crush it. And quite frankly, it's occasionally fun to watch you're apparently perfect fake competitors deliver things that don't work and to watch us walk in with our crazy show and deliver things that do. Ana Soro : Thank you. Our next question is from Samit, who asks, does Palantir view the USG hardware primes as allies or competitors? Shyam Sankar : We view the PRIMEs as allies and government -- Palantir government web services, it really enables it. So two of the primes are customers of Apollo. Two of the primes are using foundry to improve internal production and systems integration. Another prime Northrop has joined our Titan team. And I think from our perspective, America needs a prime. So like our national security depends on them. There's a lot of talk in defense tech circles about disrupting the primes. And I think there's incredible opportunity to transform what's possible with software, which, in my opinion, we're leading. But fundamentally, they're crucial to our national security, and that's because production does matter. You have to bend metal at the end of the day. And using 10 years of munitions in 10 weeks in Ukraine really underscores that point. But increasingly, production is itself software-defined and optimized. In fact, that's most of our commercial business, helping Airbus with the A350 and single-aisle ramp-up, helping BP produce more hydrocarbons, helping Panasonic build more batteries for Tesla cars, like that sort of transformation efficiency is what we want to bring to the primes as well as they've been metal. Alex Karp : Maybe what Shyam has done a really magnificent job of is, it's fair to say the primes thought we were competitive with them until recently, and not just primes, but others. But because really to get access to the kinds of data that the Pentagon has you're going to be able to -- you're going to need either Palantir or be able to build something like Palantir. And I think in all modesty, people have realized it's pretty damn hard to do what we've done. And so there was this kind of perceived misalignment. And what Shyam has been building out with FedRAMP is giving people a way to partner with us where they can extend what they're doing without having to try, which everybody still does, but it's commonly known will not work. The ability to have access to the underlying data for reasons that are highly technical, it's crazy hard to do. And so getting that full alignment is both much better for Palantir and much better for the nation. And then we're, of course, interested in it because we're pretty mission-focused and we want the nation to function better. And we're also realistic. It's not good for us to be fighting battles. We know we're much better at software. We have no interest in going into hardware. I think increasingly, they know they should not fight us on software, although some still do, which is largely stupid. Ana Soro : Thank you both. Our next question is from Mariana with Bank of America. Mariana, please turn on your camera and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Mariana Perez Mora : Morning, everyone. So I have two questions for you. Number one is on the government side, all these geopolitical events, we have seen all these countries moving really fast to actually enhanced readiness and modernization is a key asset. What is your expectation for the U.S. actually moving at this need of speed or that speed of need under a more bureaucratic -- usually more bureaucratic environment? And the other one is AIP. You have discussed already how it changed or was a catalyst for customers to be able to adopt data analytics and data infrastructure. But I'm interesting to understand, beyond boot camps, what else is changing internally? How you face customers? How you build things with AIP, and how that is impacting your margins because they look like 30% operating margins now versus 25% that you were printing before? Shyam Sankar : Maybe to start with the second one here with AIP. I think you should really think that the boot camp is more than just what's happening in the boot camp. Because you're exiting the boot camp with a series of use cases that are production ready or near production ready that you can go forward with. You're exiting the boot camp with as the customer and usually IT with enough hands-on experience with the product that you can actually keep going and compounding it going forward. So there is this exit velocity that's fundamental to it, where it's not just the go-to-market motion, it actually now becomes the implementation motion. It becomes the way in which you engage with partners because now partners can run their boot camps. Partners can drive use case growth for themselves around what came out of the boot camp and the exit velocity around that. So I think it's quite profound and why you're seeing both our emphasis of it and the impact that it's having on both the financials and the operating reality of the business. Ryan Taylor : Yeah. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, we were focused on usage and value of AIP, and we're seeing that by the end of November, 140 organizations will have delivered boot camps too, and we're seeing that and then the conversions that flow from that as well. Shyam Sankar : And to put that number in perspective, I think roughly 70 of those boot camps will happen this month in November, which is more than the number of commercial pilots we did all of last year. So the velocity scale... Alex Karp : And we're just starting. So like we're ramping up to doing them. It's -- yes. David Glazer : And then I guess on the margin side, what you're seeing is like we are investing pretty significantly. R&D is up sequentially 11% Alex Karp : I think the thing that is confusing is our go-to motion now in U.S. com is so efficient. So as you could basically look at, it is 10x more efficient, and we are ramping it up. But this is the most efficient way for us to go to market. So it's like there's -- it's not constrained by dollars. It's constrained by, do we have people that actually know the product? Do we -- have we trained them? There's not a way in which we can efficiently -- because if you're growing a business 52%, the obvious thing is you should be dumping money on it like a bonfire, especially if it's the only market that actually really matters in the world. And by the way, if you're recalibrating the standard. One of the things we did with PG, we did with GAIA, we did with MetaConstellation, it's not just that we win clients. It's that we set a standard that the competition can never meet. And that this is really important for our go-to-market strategies. It's like you can pretend you're going to build PG. The French government announces they're going to rebuild it for $40 million. You can't rebuild PG for $40 million. You can't rebuild it for $1 billion. You need us. You can't rebuild foundry. You can't really me. When we go to market with the clients are learning two things. They're learning, oh, I could use this. They're learning how to use it. They're also now going to go to every other vendor and say, but I want my thing that provide operational results and Palantir has done this in 6 hours. I like you better. I'll give you six days. I prefer you. Your steak dinner is better. Your suit is better. You're backing from the analysts is better. You don't have the madman sticking up for things that are good and right in the world despite them being unpopular. And you get all that. I'll give you an extra 10 days. Well, try that with PG, it's ridiculous. Try it with foundry it's ridiculous. Try it MetaConstellation, no one even bothers trying that. No one tries us on GAIA and they're not going to try it on an AIP either. And that's 1 of the most important things we do as a company because in the end, it is actually very attached to our mission. My view of what we should do is build products that are so good that the competition stops competing, whether that's in commercial or on the battlefield and that's what we're doing. And that's what we're seeing in AIP, and I haven't seen something like this since PG, which is our first any chair (ph) product. No one bothers even -- like currently, PG is blocked in Germany. That's because somebody doesn't -- whatever, it it's like -- they're waiting for a terror attacks [indiscernible] can win. It's like an sent. So any case, no one's both saying we should build another PG. You can't build it. So you can just opt to not have the product. There'll be people who do that. And that's the aspiration for every single one of our products, and that's what I see in AIP. Ana Soro : Thank you all. Alex, is there anything you'd like to say before we end today's call? Alex Karp : As usual, it's a wild ride if you're an investor or if you're an employee internally. We -- there's this term mission-driven culture, which I increasingly don't like because almost everyone is saying it is just waiting to get attendees and then drop their mission and be a softest. But in fact, we are believers, we are fighters, and we are a mission-driven culture, and we welcome everybody who wants to participate that as an investor or as a Palantirian or someone who follows us. Ana Soro : Thank you. That concludes Q&A for today's call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ana Soro : Good afternoon. I'm Ana Soro from Palantir's Finance Team, and I'd like to welcome you to our Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market close and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our first quarter and fiscal 2024 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance, and other statements regarding our plans, prospects, and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release, distributed after the market closed today, and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures, is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and SEC filings are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons, unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call. Ryan Taylor : 2023 was a tremendous year of opportunity and growth for our company, with US commercial at the forefront, which was meaningfully driven by AIP as the product and bootcamps as the go-to-market motion. We closed out the year with $608 million in fourth quarter revenue, representing 20% year-over-year and 9% sequential growth. Our commercial business surpassed $1 billion in revenue over the last 12 months, a noteworthy milestone. And our fourth quarter commercial revenue grew 32% year-over-year. AIP and bootcamps are accelerating our business, particularly in US commercial, where fourth quarter revenue grew 70% year-over-year, evidencing a significantly expanding addressable market. In October, we set a goal of executing 500 AIP bootcamps within one year. We have already blown that goal out of the water, having completed more than 560 bootcamps across 465 organizations to-date. We are deploying AIP to implement hundreds of real tangible use cases in production for our customers. One bootcamp attendee remarked, \"What your team did in just two days was incredible. We can already think of 100 use cases for this.\" While another said, \"It seems there are endless solutions. It seems there's nothing Palantir cannot do.\" When combining LLMs with Foundry through AIP, the ability to deploy use cases becomes much more widely accessible, so the addressable market expands considerably. We're seeing initial momentum as a result of that expansion, while also still being at the starting line in the journey to capture that market. In our US commercial business, the expanding addressable market, driven by AIP, is propelling growth both through new customer acquisitions and expansions with existing customers. I've never before seen the level of customer enthusiasm and demand that we are currently seeing from AIP in US commercial. With regard to new customer acquisition, the expanding addressable market is reflected in the greater scale of the top of our sales funnel. And now we're doubling down on how we're converting bootcamps to enterprise deals. We're already seeing evidence of bootcamps helping to significantly compress sales cycles and accelerate the rate of new customer acquisition, which rose to 22% sequentially for US commercial in Q4 versus 12% and 4% in Q3 and Q2, respectively. And we more than doubled the number of US commercial deals with TCV of $1 million or more from the fourth quarter in 2022 to 2023. We're also seeing a meaningful increase in our US commercial TCV on a dollar-weighted duration basis, which is up 107% year-over-year and 42% sequentially. We signed a multitude of US commercial deals last quarter. Just to name a few, we signed deals over $25 million each with one of the largest car rental companies, one of the largest telecommunication companies, and one of the largest pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporations in the world. And then, we also signed deals over $10 million each with an American consumer packaged goods holding company, an American automotive seat and electrical systems manufacturer, a comprehensive health network in the Midwest, and a large scale battery manufacturer. In addition, we signed deals over $5 million each with an American bank holding company, a horse racing regulatory organization, one of the world's largest equipment rental companies, and one of the largest independent non-profit cooperatives in the quick-service restaurant industry. And these are just a few of the examples. Out of these deals, we're seeing several archetypes emerge as a result of AIP. First is the new customer who attends a bootcamp and signs an enterprise contract shortly after. For instance, an American cable television provider signed a nearly $3 million deal following cold outreach on LinkedIn that led to a five-day bootcamp, then an enterprise agreement, all in the span of last quarter. Then, there's AIP-driven conversions of ongoing pilots. Following a two-year prospecting effort, a large American consumer packaged goods holding company agreed to a pilot, during which AIP was also introduced, then converted in December to a five-year $19 million contract. Then, also, there's AIP-driven expansions in key existing accounts, including one of the world's largest telecommunication companies where we demonstrated speed to value at bootcamps by delivering new use cases on top of the existing ontology in as little as 24 hours, with the results contributing to an agreement for a multimillion-dollar expansion of our existing contract. Within our international commercial business, AIP is solidifying our long-standing partnerships with existing customers, particularly in Continental Europe, while also driving pockets of growth in select markets. This includes the renewal of our long-standing partnership with Novartis, a five-year renewal with one of the largest European vehicle manufacturers, and a five-year renewal of our partnership with Swiss Re. In addition to bootcamps, we are deepening distribution channels to more rapidly seize opportunities in certain regions, including Japan. In Q4, we expanded and extended our partnership with Fujitsu to enable them to bring AIP and data integration capabilities to their global client base. We also signed an expansion with SOMPO Care to enable delivery of their real data platform to nursing homes and elder care facilities. Both of these reflected a culmination of months-long efforts prior to deal closing. In our government business, we are actively engaged across all theaters of crisis and conflict. The strength of our US government business is not reflected in the fourth quarter results, which remain muted. Some of this is due to the continuing resolution and timing of large potential contract awards. But it's also a function of the department's pace of scaling their AI and software efforts to match the realities of modern combat, particularly with JADC2. The department is responding to great power competition by ramping up investments in America's unique strength, software. We are focused on deploying on the battlefield and in large programs related to JADC2 combined with our rollout of Mission Manager and the First Breakfast initiatives, which is driving innovation in our engagement model with the government and the defense industrial base. The Army has publicly indicated they anticipate down selection to a single vendor for the next phase of TITAN to occur in Q2 of 2024. We also announced the extension of our partnership with the Army to continue operating and enhancing the Army Vantage platform, which is used for data-driven operations and decision making. We will continue to onboard partners and demonstrate the value of Mission Manager during this option year to deliver on the Army's multi-vendor ecosystem vision. On the strength of our work on the ground and our software that actually works, we expect reacceleration of our US government business in 2024. Conventional wisdom is that government acquisitions are slow, and then you need to invest in the programs that the government is buying in a two to three year acquisition cycle. And that's what programs like CD 1, AIDP, Vantage, and TITAN look like. But our business has also been driven by urgent acquisitions to meet emergent needs that we predicted and invested in years ahead of time. As the US confronts conflict in three theaters, and as all services seek rapid capabilities to meet those moments, we see substantial opportunity across the department. Turning to our international government business. We are incredibly honored that the NHS chose Palantir to help deliver a federated data platform, awarding us a consumption-based contract with \u00a3330 million allocated to improve patient care by bringing together the information needed to plan and deliver care while reducing administrative burden. Over the past few years, an increasing number of NHS trusts have used the software to reduce the care backlog. For example, at Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, it helped bring down the in-patient waiting list by 28%, and operations canceled on the day due to missed preoperative assessments subsequently fell by half. In the fourth quarter, we also received funding from a partner nation related to our ongoing efforts in Eastern Europe, which had a substantial impact on our international government results. Recent world events and global conflicts illustrate the utmost importance of Palantir's mission. It's our duty to uphold our founding principles through our continued dedication to our allies in the midst of current events. We don't take this lightly. Last month, we held our Board meeting in Tel Aviv where I saw firsthand our commitment to and support for Israel. While there, we were proud to announce our strategic partnership to supply the Israeli Defense Ministry with technology to aid in addressing the current situation in Israel. My experience there was a humbling reminder of the role we play and the responsibility that we hold. Reflecting on 2023, we feel immense pride in the missions we are supporting and in our role shepherding our customers through the ongoing transformation of their enterprises with AIP. This ongoing transformation isn't just limited to our customers. I'm proud of the incredible transformation of our enterprise in 2023, and I'm excited about what it will bring in 2024 as we conquer the expanding market. I'll now turn it over to Shyam. Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Ryan. As Ryan mentioned, the expanding addressable market, driven by AIP, is propelling growth both through new customer acquisitions and expansions with existing customers. We continue to focus on accelerating the rate of bootcamps with current and prospective customers. From customer feedback, the AI platform meets this moment like none other. AI has radically recalibrated customer expectations for software. Expectations at AIP and Foundry exceed by enabling the elegant integration of humans, software, and AI to deliver operational outcomes quickly. We are focused on the end-to-end problem of value creation, not a small narrow technical slice. Accordingly, our platforms focus on tools, not tuning on transforming business processes, not seeking iotas of insight. AIP is the AI-powered operating system for the enterprise, not a Q&A bot, not an agent framework, not a way to dabble, but a way to deliver. At a recent two-day bootcamp with the construction, engineering and architecture company, our customer developed a production-ready use case that provided $10 million of savings. They used AIP to build an AI-powered disruption manager application that processes production disruption notifications through AIP Logic to determine what the best new production plan would be. AIP, wielding a linear optimizer as a tool, and using LLMs to parameterize and contextualize the disruption, translates the notification to a clear understanding of impact on the optimized schedule. AIP Logic and AIP Automate then rerun the optimizer to generate opportunities to respond to disruption, two days, $10 million. We have covered nearly 200 use cases coming out of all these bootcamps, and we are just getting started. The core theory of value that has driven our product strategy for time eternal is data integration, that bringing new data into an operationally-relevant context to expand the complexity, nuance and surface area of decision making always produces value. AIP enables us to integrate so many types of new data, video conferences, incident response calls, Slack rooms, PDFs, images, video, audio, and exploit them through the power of LLMs and ontology. So much of what data defines a process is not actually in the system that runs that process, but instead in conversations, conference calls, videos of the factory floor, or images of a site. What's in the enterprise process system is a lossy latent representation of this reality. Our software always exploited that phenomenon that the truth is out there, not in your ERP system or that blessed application. With AIP, we are investing in multi-modal approaches to compound on this proven value driver and expand the addressable market of use cases within the enterprise. As I've said before with AI and LLMs, you can't think your way through it. You have to get your hands dirty and work in anger to get use cases into production. In AIP, we have built a platform to deliver proof, not just proofs of concept, to our customers, and bootcamps are the way to flex that string. At AIPCon 3, we will have many customers on stage showing you their great work. Come taste the pudding. Turning to government, Palantir is experiencing its own Amazon.com-to-AWS moment, taking exquisite first-party technology that supports the largest scale defense tech player and making it available for third parties to build on and win, Gotham, Gaia, MetaConstellation, this is our software, less well-understood. And now being commercialized is our software infrastructure, platforms like Apollo, the capabilities that we had to build over 20 years to enable hundreds of dev teams to independently release 2,500 products and services to nearly 1,000 customer environments, including about 100 air gapped environments delivering 90,000 upgrades a week. This infrastructure abstracts away supply chain security, environment heterogeneity, and infrastructure, so that developers can be operationally responsible for their services across it all so they can focus on delivering innovation to the war fighter. And that's exactly why the Palantir government webservice's offering is so compelling. $100 billion has been invested by venture capitalists into defense tech since 2021. These companies want to compete on quality, not beating back bureaucracy. Government Web Services creates a capital and time efficient way to unlock market access for new entrants and incumbents alike. But even beyond defense tech companies, an extended set of these capabilities that we call Mission Manager are uniquely suited to delivering the capabilities that we have heard all government PMs asking for. Program offices want to pursue multi-vendor, big tent ecosystem acquisition strategies with government owned and managed interfaces. The typical way to pursue this is with a systems integrator where they are managing the integration with billable hours constrained by humans. At Palantir, we do this with software as a software integrator. We see a more significant market opportunity in Mission Manager and Government Web Services over the long term than C2, intel and data platforms alone. We have already launched Mission Manager projects starting with the US Army, a customer whose needs and feedback have heavily shaped this offering. We continue to invest in relationships with the defense industrial base to help them bend metal more profitably and efficiently. In their earnings calls, America's prime signalled that they're pulling back from getting substantially burned on firm fixed price contracts. This is a giant step in the wrong direction for America. So, we want to lean in and help them optimize their supply chains, their production plans, quality, and overall delivery against these contracts that have enormous opportunity to generate margin for them. But we are also working aggressively with new entrants to start with Foundry as their production software from Day 0. M-Day was yesterday. We have no time to waste to mobilize America's industrial base to ramp production. Finally, our products could not be playing a more central role for real world events. Our AI-enabled platforms are being leveraged maximally to support key US government goals in the Middle East. We have surged support to Israel to enable the Israeli Defense Forces and intelligence services to leverage Gaia, Gotham Foundry, an AIP to tackle a growing list of use cases from tactical command and control, visual intelligence, forensics, readiness, and production. At the same time, great power competition with China remains top of mind as we continue to invest in moving more of Palantir's mass west of the international date line. And we continue to support Ukraine's efforts directly and through allies. When the bat signal goes up, Palantir's Gotham platform and its family of products have always answered the call. At the same time, monetization of these efforts will take time. The principal reason is that the DoD is at the very beginning of a long-term allocation shift from hardware to software. For example, the Army is spending a mere 0.015% of its budget on command and control software in fiscal year '24. But as we confront crisis and conflict in three theaters, this is changing. Growth is being driven by the incredible dynamism of the US commercial market, and US government will follow. With that, I'll hand it over to Dave to talk us through the financials. Dave Glazer : Thanks, Shyam. We had an exceptionally strong fourth quarter, marked by our outperformance across revenue, profitability and cash flow. Revenue growth accelerated to 20% year-over-year in Q4 on the back of our US commercial business, which alone grew 70% year-over-year, a result driven by our momentum in AIP. Adjusted operating margin continued to expand to 34% in the fourth quarter, highlighting the strong unit economics of our business. We beat the high end of our guidance range on both revenue and adjusted operating margin, driving an 800 basis point sequential increase to our Rule of 40 score, from 46% in the third quarter to 54% in the fourth quarter. We also delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. In 2023, we generated $210 million of GAAP net income, a $584 million increase from 2022. In the fourth quarter alone, we generated nearly $100 million in GAAP net income. We also delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP operating profit, generating a $120 million of GAAP operating income in 2023, a $281 million increase year-over-year. Our GAAP operating profit accelerated in each quarter of last year. And in the fourth quarter alone, GAAP operating income increased 65% sequentially to $66 million, our highest quarter ever of GAAP operating income. We generated over $300 million in adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter, representing a margin of 50% and over $730 million of adjusted free cash flow for the full year. Turning to our global top-line results. Fourth quarter revenue accelerated to $608 million, up 20% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. We generated $2.23 billion of revenue in 2023, representing a growth rate of 17% year-over-year. We generated $1.38 billion in total US revenue in 2023, representing a growth rate of 19% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, fourth quarter revenue grew 20% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, and full year revenue grew 20% year-over-year. Customer count grew 35% year-over-year and 10% sequentially to 497 customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. Fourth quarter trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased to 11% year-over-year to $55 million per customer. Now moving to our commercial segment. Fourth quarter commercial revenue grew 32% year-over-year and 13% sequentially to $284 million. Full year commercial revenue grew 20% year-over-year to over $1 billion, surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, fourth quarter commercial revenue grew 35% year-over-year and 12% sequentially, and full year commercial revenue grew 28% year-over-year. Fourth quarter commercial TCV booked was $699 million, our highest commercial TCV quarter in the company's history, representing a 156% growth year-over-year and 74% growth sequentially. Last quarter, our US commercial business saw rapid acceleration and unprecedented demand. Fourth quarter US commercial revenue grew 70% year-over-year and 12% sequentially to $131 million. Full year US commercial revenue grew 36% year-over-year to $457 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, fourth quarter US commercial revenue grew 71% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, and full year US commercial revenue grew 52% year-over-year. Our momentum in AIP is driving both new customer conversions and existing customer expansions. The transformation that AIP is having on our business It's best highlighted in our US commercial bookings and backlog. In the fourth quarter, we booked $343 million of US commercial TCV, representing a 107% growth year over year on a dollar-weighted duration basis. Total remaining deal value in our US commercial business grew 32% year-over-year and 28% sequentially. Our US commercial customer count grew to 221 customers, reflecting 55% growth year-over-year and 22% growth sequentially. Fourth quarter international commercial revenue grew 11% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to a $154 million, as we continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East, and beyond. As Ryan mentioned, we've been capturing value and footprint from AIP momentum, and two examples are from our work with Fujitsu and SOMPO. These customers have been using AIP for months prior to the deal's closing, resulting in some revenue catch up last quarter. Full year international commercial revenue grew 9% year-over-year to $546 million. Revenue from strategic commercial contracts was $20 million for the quarter. We anticipate first quarter 2024 revenue from these customers to decline to between $14 million to $16 million compared to $33 million in the first quarter of 2023. We anticipate 2024 revenue from these customers to decline to approximately 2% of full year revenue compared to approximately 4% of revenue in 2023. Shifting to our government segment. Fourth quarter government revenue grew 11% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $324 million. Full year government revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $1.22 billion. Fourth quarter US government revenue grew 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $237 million. Full year US government revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $921 million. As Ryan mentioned, while our fourth quarter US government results are muted due to the timing of larger contract awards, we expect our US government business to reaccelerate in 2024. Fourth quarter international government revenue grew 27% year-over-year and 11% sequentially to $87 million, bolstered by our work in healthcare and defense. This included the receipt of funding from a partner nation related to our ongoing efforts in Eastern Europe, which resulted in a revenue catch-up for the quarter. Full year international government revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $301 million. We had an outstanding quarter of bookings. Fourth quarter TCV booked was $1.15 billion, up a 192% year-over-year and 38% sequentially. Net dollar retention was a 108%, an increase of a 100 basis points from last quarter. Net dollar retention does not include revenue from new customers that we acquired in the past 12 months and, therefore, does not yet fully capture the acceleration in our US commercial business. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.9 billion in total remaining deal value, an increase of 5% sequentially, and $1.2 billion in remaining performance obligations, an increase of 28% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business, as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business. Turning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 84% for the quarter and 82% for the year. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, was $209 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 34% and marking the fifth consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins. Full year adjusted income from operations was $633 million, representing a margin of 28% and 600 basis point increase compared to 2022. Q4 adjusted expense was $399 million, up 1% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. Full year adjusted expense was $1.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Our bottom-line outperformance in 2023 has positioned us to be able to escalate investment and resources to AIP. As a result, we expect expenses to increase in Q1, but remain focused on calibrating expense growth below revenue growth for the full year in order to continue delivering on our goals of sustained GAAP profitability and operating income. In the fourth quarter, we generated GAAP operating income of $66 million, representing an 11% margin, our fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP operating income. Full year GAAP operating income was $120 million. We generated fourth quarter GAAP net income of $93 million, representing a 15% margin, our fifth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. Full year GAAP net income was $210 million. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.08, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.04. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $0.25, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.09. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 54% in the fourth quarter, an 800 basis point increase to our Rule of 40 score from the prior quarter. We continue to strive to maintain this exceptional balance of top- and bottom-line performance. Turning to our cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we generated $301 million in cash from operations and $305 million in adjusted free cash flow, both representing a margin of 50%. In 2023, we generated $712 million in cash flow from operations and $731 million in adjusted free cash flow. We ended Q4 with $3.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term US treasury securities. We retain access to additional liquidity of up to $500 million through our revolving credit facility, which remains entirely undrawn. Now, turning to our outlook. For Q1 2024, we expect revenue of between $612 million and $616 million; adjusted income from operations of between a $196 million and $200 million. For full year 2024, we expect revenue of between $2.652 billion and $2.668 billion; US commercial revenue in excess of $640 million, representing a growth rate of at least 40%; adjusted income from operations of between $834 million and $850 million; adjusted free cash flow of between $800 million and $1 billion; GAAP operating income and net income in each quarter of this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks, and then Ana will kick off the Q&A. Alex Karp : Welcome to our earnings. There's really so much to say. Obviously, our performance in US commercial is extraordinary, some would say bombastic. The numbers that just fly off the screen are the 70% year-on-year growth in Q4. The number numbers that I almost had to turn the page when I saw them were the -- over 100 contracts, over $1 million, 37 over $5 million, and 21, roughly, over $10 million. There is -- it's almost inconceivable to do that many contracts given the way our product used to be. And so, what you see is a convergence of our product being easier to use, an augmentation of its charisma, both driven by developments in AI, large language models, which make the product approachable foundry to the broader market. You also see just this enormous demand and our ability to meet that demand with a pilot -- new piloting approach that we call bootcamp. So, we went, like -- two years ago, we did 92 pilots. And last year, really mostly the second half of the year, we did over 500 bootcamps. I go around the country now telling CEOs, CTOs, and really, whoever has $1 million to buy our product and transform their enterprise, take everything you've done in AI since you started, put your best people on it, and we're going to show up at any time you want, and we're going to run your data at a bootcamp for 10 hours. And then, you compare your self-pleasuring to our operationally-relevant, commercially-valuable, critical-to-your-enterprise results. Our 10 hours, your 10 months. Any products you want, any vendor you want, any hyperscaler you want, you pick them, we'll show up. The reaction to this because every -- what America obviously realize is this is real. But if you took the total number of people, total number of enterprises that are doing AI of any kind, including Algebra, and said, it would be probably less than the 300. We have 300 customers that are creating operational results using our AIP power -- operational meaning, define how you want, I'm defining as they'll pay $1 million or more for it. So, it's real. And we're doing this at a scale and pace that is inconceivable for Palantir up until recently. And you have just have number after number after number, interface after interface, this is -- there are some caveats. Europe has decided that they are not going to engage in this revolution. There are other caveats for our society. I don't want to spend too much time on that, but the winners are going to win more. This is a revolution for incumbents that have distribution and already strong products, which is why we're massively outperforming. There's some caveats for us internally. We're having to rebuild the whole system, our whole company to deal with this demand. We have a latent nascent sales force that has put its tiny toe in the water and has noticed that it can move around. We have to build that into a strong, aggressive machine. There are some positive caveats. We're doing this our way. We are not -- we are proud of our work on the front. We are proud that we support the US. We are proud that we support the US military. We are proud to have an operational crucial role in Ukraine, and I am exceedingly proud that after October 7, within weeks, we are on the ground, and we are involved in operationally crucial, operations in Israel. I know of no other software company in the world that has been engaged by Ukraine and Israel, or in general, I'm not sure they buy software from any other company at our scale. These are momentous events built on the back of a 20-year assumption that software would define our reality. The winners would be those that understood software, rejecting linear, narrow, sales-driven software, Frankenstein monster infrastructures that have been so historically popular for investment in Silicon Valley, rejecting sophism, as not only an approach to business, meaning I only say what I believe if it doesn't matter or I never say what I believe. Those assumptions have seeped into our products, whether they're a military product, whether they're foundry, or ontology, or AIP. They also -- by the way, for those listening who think our strategy is crazy, many of your best people are applying to Palantir now. So, while we may be crazy, we are being bombarded by people who want to work at this company, bombarded. I cannot -- a day does not go by where I'm not getting a call, an email, 50 attempts to get into our company. We are razor, we are white-hot in recruiting. We're 20-year company with the strongest recruiting I've ever seen from a company that's historically had the strongest recruiting in the most competitive environment in the world, Silicon Valley. That is because we stand behind our values and because we intend to win with those values, which we're approving. So, this was an extraordinary last year. We also took care of making sure we're aligned internally on comp. We are streamlining our events, the way we go to market. And I would also say from the perspective as, the leader of our movement, nominally called the CEO of our company, we have never been this aligned internally. We are a company that engages the most talented, interesting, and difficult people in the world. Some of them are at this table. And there has never been a time where we have been this motivated, this in unison, and this proud of our company and our accomplishments. And so, I'm proud to be proud with them, and we are going to keep on on our efforts, and I foresee a very, very strong year, especially in US commercial. I would also say this strength of our US commercial and the strength of our products being used in the most difficult and most important war zones in the world is going to have a handoff function into USG, and I'm optimistic that handoff function will happen, and we will be as successful there as we are in US com. A - Ana Soro : With that, we'll begin with a few questions from our shareholders before we open up the call. Our first question is from Andrew. Given the significant increase in demand for AIP, could the management team elaborate on the advancements made in formulating monetization strategy for these offerings? Ryan Taylor : Yeah. You're right to comment. The demand is off the charts for AIP, with bootcamps as the delivery mechanism for AIP, and we're seeing AIP drive the expanding addressable market, that we're seeing. As Alex commented, we closed 103 deals in Q4 alone over $1 million. Having been involved in many of those directly and on the ground, I can tell you that the feeling, the demand, the excitement over AIP and over Palantir is unlike anything I've seen in the 14 years I've been here, and we feel that. We feel that in a tangible way on the ground with our customers, And we're starting to see the beginnings of that in our Q4 results. In October, we set the goal of executing 500 bootcamps for top of funnel for AIP. As noted, we've already exceeded that with over 560 bootcamps just about four months later, and that is only continuing to increase that momentum. Then, you see the results in US commercial, 70% year-over-year growth in revenue in Q4, 55% growth in customer count year-over-year, a 107% growth in TCV closed on an adjusted basis. And then, you see emerging from that the archetypes -- to the question on monetization, the archetypes of the types of monetization we're seeing. Either it's -- first, it's boot camps that are quickly converting to paying customers or it's expansion of existing customers or it's customers where maybe we've been engaged for a while and introduction of AIP, that whole process has been accelerated. We're seeing that across the board, and yet at the same time, we barely touched that addressable market, and we're really only at the beginning. So excited to see where that takes us. Ana Soro : Thanks, Ryan. Our next question is from Tanner who asks, what kind of interest has the FedStart program seen as of late? Has the market responded to this? And will there be additional marketing made towards these start-ups? And relatedly, when do you expect Apollo to be a significant contributor to Palantir's revenue? Shyam Sankar : Great. Thanks, Tanner. Yeah, FedStart has been a hit. And I think it's easy to understand why. There's been $100 billion of capital that's flowed into the defense tech community at large. No one can afford the two years and $2 million it takes to achieve this accreditation. This provides market access. We've started with an intense focus on IL5, bringing folks to the DoD market. We plan to release an IL6 FedStart at the end of Q2 and FedRAMP High at the end of Q3, early Q4. And we're also going to be taking this to our allies. So, we intend to launch FedStart with the UK on the secret network and above top secret network later this year. Apollo is having its moment. I think the charisma it has with customers when they see it running at scale, running, managing all $2.2 billion of our revenue, I think a big part of this is they've spent the last two years trying to solve these problems on their own. And then, this really understand how much value it can contribute to them, how much can accelerate them, both on the government program side, but also on the company side, where companies are struggling with how to efficiently deliver modern software into these environments. But I think the bigger thing that I'm really excited about is Mission Manager, which is Apollo Rubix, which is our Zero Trust compute and networking infrastructure and the ontology software development kit, the OSDK as a combined offering to the government to really give the government what they've been asking for, which is infrastructure that allows them to build and manage multi-vendor big tent ecosystems that drive continuous competition and allow the government to actually control the interfaces and avoid lock-in. And so, you can think of FedStart as actually the first product that we've launched on top of Mission Manager infrastructure. We've started doing other projects, including Army C2 work, but that's going to be a very exciting trend for us. Alex Karp : Let me just give an addendum here. Shyam launched and built FedStart. But one of the most important things it did is before we launched FedStart, the $100 billion of investment in kind of new defense tech, largely at the impression Palantir was competitive with them. And we weren't competitive with them. And FedStart aligns all those venture capitalists and all their investments in most of their companies with Palantir because we can allow them to get on to classified networks much quicker so that they can actually show results to their investors much quicker. And that means a lot of the resistance to us is not only disappearing, but it's going -- it's actually been converted into support for Palantir, support for what we're doing. And those people are really helping spread the obvious Palantir gospel instead of wondering how they can compete with us, they're wondering how we can succeed together. Ana Soro : Thank you, both. Our next question is from Keith. Is your greatest competitor still your potential customers' own IT department, or has that changed? Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Keith. We certainly used to feel that way. But when you look at bootcamps, you look at how much charisma AIP has with IT and the fact that we're winning with IT with Apollo, with the OSDK, with capabilities like Marketplace, that's certainly not the case anymore. IT has become some of our biggest champions. And I think what that's revealed for us is that perhaps the issue was never actually IT. It was this software industrial complex. Everything Alex was talking about earlier, these thin products that were really designed to sell and they're more like a drug than they are like medicine, and the sort of strict adherence to architectural conformity. But what I think is exciting about GenAI is it's blown up all of that. It's been a big reset button here. The whole map, the whole architecture is up for grabs, and we're working very closely with IT to write that map, to write the architecture that is actually delivering all these operational use cases for these customers. Alex Karp : Yeah, one of the coolest things about going to these meetings is it used to be three, four years ago, you could predict who was going to like us and who wasn't, and it's just not anymore. You go to these meetings and they'll often be the IT person telling CEO, like, look, we have no choice. We got to -- we need to install this quickly. And so, there's a cultural shift in the US. I don't think it's outside the US is the case. But inside the US, people in IT are responsible for business value. This creates business value. And they're often responsible for global business value. They're not that interested in putting together a PowerPoint and showing how that could work in theory. They've got to show themselves, their company, their workers, the whole -- that they're going to get actual revenue either driving or quality of revenue driving results quickly. And they are almost exclusively now our friends. Maybe they can talk to some analysts. We can convert you guys, too. Ana Soro : Thanks. Our next question is from Mariana with Bank of America. Mariana, can you please turn on your camera, and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Mariana Perez : Good afternoon, everyone. So, I have two questions, one in US government and the second one today on financials. So, the first one is this. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, we're accelerating US government growth and opportunities across the board. But this is contrasting to what we have heard from the primes this quarter. They have agreed that more things are moving towards software, but they argue that the DoD has to figure out how to buy software, and they have to figure out how to sell software. From your point of view, how large is the change that is netted in this award approach, but also how large is the advantage that Palantir has in this environment where you have been selling software for a long time now? Shyam Sankar : Yeah. Look, we've been doing this for two decades as you point out, and I think that gives us a perspective of what was it like two decades ago and what is it like now. And it's wildly different and so much has changed. Now, I don't want to underestimate how much has to continue changing. And I think the department recognizes that and is working on that, but to not acknowledge the progress, I think, would be disingenuous here. Unlike the primes, who use to focus on hardware and now responding to software, we've always focused on software. And one of the things about software is it evolves incredibly quickly. If you think about the software we were deploying to do the Afghan non-combatant evacuation operations and how much that evolved moving into Ukraine, how much that evolved moving into the current crisis in CENTCOM, it is evolving faster than procurement can procure it. And I think one of the unique strengths that we have is that we are investing and mutating and managing the software independent of the actual procurement actions. And that means that we always have software that\u2019s so far in the future that it will meet the moment that the DoD actually has. Alex Karp : As an addendum to that, the core thesis of this -- of Palantir was always the reality of a disjointed violent world forces pareto-optimal conditions on institutions. So, I believe that everyone knows we have the best software in the world. It may not matter in a non-dangerous environment. But it did matter in Ukraine and Israel, and who did they buy? It does matter our software is running in -- I never know what do I say, but in among the most critical places in the DoD, if you -- if we are forced to fight a three-pronged war, you cannot do that even from a perspective of keeping ammunitions ready without accurate software. So the more dangerous, the more real it gets, the more battle-tested and real your software has to be. I believe it's about to get very real. Why? Because our GDP growth is significantly better than China's. Now, I know the always wrong crowd says, We then should get peace. But I'm telling you that the rational result -- or the rational consequences of that is our adversaries are like America is going to be stronger tomorrow than today. So, like, they don't have a GDP story because they cannot -- they do not build these systems as well as we do. They do not have the tech community we do and they do not have the US market like we do. Look at our results. And so, as this becomes more and more dangerous every company in the world, whether they're small, big, whether they're a start-up, whether they're one of the largest primes, whether us, is going to have to actually prove their software works on the battlefield. We love that. We want to prove -- and we welcome and relish proving environments. If it was up to me, software would only be deployed at America and Western allies if it was proven on the battlefield. Unfortunately, for us, our adversaries are going to force that kind of adjudication. And how do we -- and for those of you who can't evaluate that because you don't have access to our software in the battlefield, though you could read the news and see what Israel has done and what Ukraine has done, look what's happening in US commercial. You have a completely rational environment where we're deploying and growing the way we're growing with almost no sales force. And it's because it really matters. And when it really matters, the fact that they may not like my jokes or my habits, it will protect your life. And that's why we're going to do well. Ana Soro : Thank you, Alex. Our next question is from Dan with Wedbush. Dan, please turn on your camera and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Dan Ives : Thank you. So, I think, inconceivable the right word in terms of everything that you produced this quarter. My question would be, are you starting to actually see an acceleration in terms of AIP customer engagement, not even just from Q4, but even starting 2024? Alex Karp : Do you want to handle that as the man on the front line? Ryan Taylor : Yeah. I mean the answer is yes, absolutely. And I think we're still very early, obviously, with AIP and the rollout and very early in the market. But as far as what we're seeing from customers you see -- I mean just see like kind of Q3 to Q4 results and then what we're seeing in the conversations we're having with customers, the way that it's being adopted by the business, as Alex talked about, in the conversations we're having with customers, we're seeing that acceleration, and we expect that to continue. Alex Karp : Also, just like we do these AIP conferences, I think we invited you and your team, we can't do enough of them. We're telling -- we're limiting the number of people who can come. It's like a rock concert. It's like, yeah, yeah, if you know somebody, we can get you backstage. By the way, for those of you who are evaluating our company, we are going to invite all of you to our bootcamps. Please use as you did, but like take a look at the software. It's like we are not arguing in the abstract or in a PowerPoint or according to what you may have learned at business school that is better, we are arguing that it is better. And there's no other way to show that, but to do it. But to your question, yeah, like, we're already overfilled for our AIP bootcamp. And it's just we don't know how to deal actually with this demand. And so, we're rebuilding the company. And we have a lot of employees in Germany and France. I'm telling them it's time to pack up and come to America. I'm telling our hiring, we are hiring here. We are having, as I mentioned, a bonanza of people wanting to work here because people are quite frankly tired of working for people who seemingly only have an opinion when it doesn't matter and with products that may not work. We're looking at -- I'm getting personally involved in the recruiting again to get more people, but exactly the right people, and we're going to scale against the demand. But it's a real thing. Ana Soro : Thank you. Alex, as usual, we have a lot of our shareholders on the line. Is there anything you'd like to say before we end the call? Alex Karp : I mean, we are fighting for the West and its allies to be stronger. And we -- I very much appreciate your support. At this company, we think about our investors. Our most important investors are at Palantir, our second most important investors are people investing their own money. And we relish your support, and it gives us a lot of motivation. I meet individual investors every time I go to a customer basically. And I've had individual investors, I've met at 2 :00 a.m., 3:00 a.m. on a VTC, and I asked them, \"Well, why are you working at 3 :00 a.m. to make your enterprise better in AIP or Foundry?\" And they basically all say the same thing, because Palantir is fighting for my rights and my liberty. And we are fighting for your rights and your liberty and we are going to continue to fight for that the way we do that, which is by delivering the best products to our allies by hurting our adversaries and by giving US commercial the strength it needs to massively outperform every other country in the world. So, thank you. Ana Soro : Thanks, Alex. That concludes Q&A for today's call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ana Soro : Good afternoon. I'm Ana Soro from Palantir's finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market closed and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our second quarter and fiscal 2024 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and other earnings materials are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call. Ryan Taylor : We started the year exceedingly strong with revenue of $634 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year driven by the momentum of AIP and our continued strong performance in U.S. commercial. Our results also highlight the growing strength of our U.S. government business and our enduring mission-critical work. The continued interest in AIP is loud and clear in the conversations I'm having across our customer base. We've shared our plans to capture the market with AIP, and our results show that our strategy is not only succeeding, it is accelerating. While still early days, our focus is on building the foundations of a long-term business. We intend to relentlessly continue landing new customers and subsequently expanding those engagements as our products gain traction and have meaningful impact within enterprises. Not only are we increasing the volume of new customers, but I'm pleased with our ability to grow these new customers as well. With regards to landing new customers, we've sustained our high volume of boot camps with over 915 organizations participating to date to meet inbound demand. We are also seeing substantial deal cycle compression. As one example, a leading utility company, signed a 7-figure deal just 5 days after completing a boot camp. Another customer immediately signed a paid engagement after just one day of their multi-day boot camp and then converted to a 7-figure deal 3 weeks later. We expect the favorable unit economics and higher throughput to continue to accelerate our business. U.S. commercial is where we're seeing the greatest transformation. While Q1 is seasonally our slowest quarter, AIP adoption by new and existing customers helped drive notable growth in customer acquisition and revenue in our U.S. commercial business. In Q1, we added 41 net new customers in U.S. commercial. Our customer count increased 69% year-over-year and 19% quarter-over-quarter, compared to 8% quarter-over-quarter growth in Q1 2023. Excluding strategic investments, our U.S. commercial revenue soared by 68% year-over-year and 22% quarter-over-quarter. New customers span a variety of industries, as AIP's applications seem endless, from the largest independent bottling company in the U.S. to a leading energy and infrastructure company and a multinational airline. In Q1, our U.S. commercial business had customers from 56 of the 74 gigs industries. As we're landing new customers, we're also seeing those customers expanding their work with us. Across my conversations with customers, I've seen the recurring theme of them asking me how they can do more, faster with enterprise transformations driven by AI. We're showing them how they can move their AI strategy beyond chat. Existing customers such as Lowe's, Cleveland Clinic and General Mills, among others, are realizing the extensive possibilities of AIP within their own enterprises and increasing their scope accordingly. Lowe's accelerated its engagement from a starting point of no AI to utilizing production level AI for over 1,000 customer service agents, resulting in a 75% reduction in overdue tasks, as one of its directors noted, \"We achieved this in just 4 months and onboarded 1,000 users within 3 weeks of rollout\". Cleveland Clinic committed to a 10-year expansion deal to deploy more broadly across its hospitals. General Mills expanded the scope of its work further last quarter as its Senior Director noted, \"We're saving on average about $14 million annually, and it's really only deployed to part of our network as we speak\". We're seeing rapid expansions within key customer accounts. For example, a Fortune 500 industrial company signed a 3-year expansion deal, which increased the annual revenue run rate of our work with them nearly fivefold compared to our initial engagement with them in 2022. A Fortune 100 retail company started a pilot in Q2 2023, expanded to a use case conversion in August and expanded its work to a $12 million ACV enterprise engagement last quarter. These are just a few examples. More and more customers are expanding their work with us due to AIP and the incredible traction our software has within their organizations. Turning to our U.S. government business. Our revenue continued to accelerate last quarter, increasing 8% quarter-over-quarter versus 3% quarter-over-quarter in Q4, with our products every day having critical impact on current world events. We see continued demand for Mission Manager and positive reception to First Breakfast. Last quarter, we were honored the U.S. Army awarded Palantir, over $178 million to be the sole prime contractor to build a next-generation targeting node under the TITAN program. This marks the first time that a software company has won a prime contract for a hardware system and exemplifies Palantir's position as the software prime, opening the door to vast new opportunities. It is with immense reference that we approach building and maturing our revolutionary capabilities for our war fighters. In our international government business, we are continuing to ramp up the critical work for delivery of the U.K. NHS federated data platform as well as providing defense capabilities to Allied Partners around the world. Looking at our business and its impact broadly, I'm invigorated about the year ahead. We have never had more conviction about AIP and the power of our software as well as our continued efforts supporting the most critical missions around the globe. I'll now turn it over to Shyam. Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Ryan. The clear signal from AIP boot camps is that AI is for builders, so many anecdotes and quotes from customers all reinforcing the same point. They are getting more done in a day or 2 in AIP than, in a quarter or 2 without. We have pioneered the approach to getting beyond chat and unlocking the value of LOMs in the enterprise, taking inherently unstructured inputs that are flying around the enterprise, be it e-mails, Slacks, PDFs, images, comments, audio and turning them into structured actions and outputs; taking an e-mail from a customer requesting a different product mix and turning it into an actual inventory allocation in the ERP system of record; taking a health claims denial and programmatically generating the documentation and supporting evidence from the clinical records and contracts; automating P&C insurance claims processing and even in government using vision models to narrow candidate products driving foodborne outbreaks at CDC; and we have started rolling out Build with AIP, a series of developer and builder oriented tutorials and reference implementations that enable builders to ramp quickly on the primitives and power of AIP and practical examples that unlock every employee at every customer. Our growth is being driven by the incredible dynamism of the U.S. commercial market, and we believe the U.S. government will follow. With this momentum, we have launched builder boot camps in the U.S. government. The U.S. Army recently issued a memo identifying 2 Palantir systems, AIDP and Army Vantage as amongst the 5 total platforms approved for builders. The U.S. Army's Artificial Intelligence Integration Center, AI2C at Carnegie Mellon, leverages these platforms for half of their active projects and recently built an application for the 18th Airborne core with OSDK. Our DoD customer recently hosted a hackathon showing the value of the open joint all-domain command and control or JADC2 SDK that we have been pioneering. One participant commented, nominating targets with GAIA assist turns a 6-hour workflow into 10 seconds. We continue to invest in Mission Manager, and we'll be extending it to the edge with our Edge X infrastructure and U.S. government. Now customers can use their cloud instance as an integrated development environment for edge platforms, centrally build, test and continuously deploy and manage multivendor big tech edge ecosystems. It covers everything from streaming pipelines, OSDK-backed applications, native Gotham applications and third-party apps. We are excited with our team of rock star partners to deliver on the U.S. Army's Titan program. This marks the first time a software company has won a hardware contract, firmly establishing the role of the software prime. We believe the core of this software target workbench will be critical in every cockpit, every vehicle and every ship. Finally, I'd like to acknowledge the eye-watering work of our service members and our allies in meeting the moment defending against the massive Iranian attack on Israel. The Gotham investments in JADC2 performed excellently, and we're building even more even faster. I'll turn it over to Dave to take us through the numbers. David Glazer : Thanks, Shyam. Q1 was a strong start to the year. Revenue growth accelerated to 21% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by momentum in AIP and our U.S. commercial business and a reacceleration in our U.S. Government business. We delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability, generating a record $106 million of GAAP net income in the first quarter. We also delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of GAAP operating profit, generating a record $81 million of GAAP operating income in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin expanded to 36% in the first quarter continuing to highlight the strong unit economics of our business.  The revenue and profitability outperformance drove a 3-point sequential increase to our Rule of 40 Score from 54 in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 57 in the first quarter of 2024. This was the third consecutive quarter of an expanding Rule of 40 Score.  Turning to our global top line results. We generated $634 million in revenue in the first quarter, up 21% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, first quarter revenue grew 24% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Customer count grew 42% year-over-year and 11% sequentially to 554 customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. First quarter trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 9% year-over-year to $55 million per customer.  Now moving to our commercial segment. First quarter commercial revenue grew 27% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $299 million. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, first quarter commercial revenue grew 36% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. We had a very strong quarter of commercial bookings. First quarter commercial TCV booked was $505 million, representing a 187% growth year-over-year.  Our U.S. commercial business continues to see unprecedented demand driven by momentum from AIP. First quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 40% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $150 million, surpassing international commercial revenue for the first time. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts. First quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 68% year-over-year and 22% sequentially.   AIP is driving both new customer conversions and existing customer expansions in the U.S. In the first quarter, we booked $286 million of U.S. commercial TCV, representing 131% growth year-over-year. Total remaining deal value in our U.S. commercial business grew 74% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. Our U.S. commercial customer count grew to 262 customers, reflecting 69% growth year-over-year and 19% growth sequentially.  We generated $149 million in international commercial revenue in the first quarter, representing 16% growth year-over-year but a 3% sequential decline as a result of continued headwinds in Europe and the revenue catch up in Q4 that we noted last quarter. We continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East and beyond. Revenue from strategic commercial contracts was $24 million in the quarter. We anticipate second quarter 2024 revenue from these customers to decline to between $7 million to $9 million compared to $19 million in the second quarter of 2023. We continue to anticipate 2024 revenue from these customers to be approximately 2% of full year revenue.  Shifting to our Government segment. First quarter government revenue grew 16% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $335 million. First quarter U.S. government revenue grew 12% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $257 million. As Ryan noted, we're excited to be the sole prime contractor under the Titan program, and we'll continue pursuing other defense opportunities. We believe we're well positioned to see growth in our U.S. government business over the course of 2024. First quarter international government revenue grew 33% year-over-year and declined 9% sequentially to $79 million as a result of the revenue catch-up in Q4 that we noted last quarter and continued headwinds in Europe. First quarter TCV booked was $904 million, up 128% year-over-year. Net dollar retention was 111%, an increase of 300 basis points from last quarter. The increase was driven both by expansions at existing customers and new customers acquired in Q1 of last year. As net dollar retention does not include revenue from new customers that are acquired in the past 12 months, it does not yet fully capture the acceleration of velocity in our U.S. commercial business over the past year.  We ended the first quarter with $4.1 billion in total remaining deal value, an increase of 22% year-over-year and 6% sequentially and $1.3 billion in remaining performance obligations, an increase of 39% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business, as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business.  Turning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 83% for the quarter. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes was $226 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 36% and marking the sixth consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins. Q1 adjusted expense was $408 million, up 2% sequentially and 2% year-over-year.  Turning to the balance of the year. Given our conviction in the U.S. business, coupled with our margin expansion, we intend to boost investment in resources in the U.S., including an AIP and specific defense opportunities. While we expect expenses to ramp starting in Q2 through the back half of the year, we remain focused on calibrating expense growth below revenue growth for the full year in order to continue delivering on our goal of sustained GAAP profitability and GAAP operating income.  In the first quarter, we generated GAAP operating income of $81 million, representing a 13% margin, our fifth consecutive quarter of GAAP operating income and fourth consecutive quarter of expanding GAAP operating margins. We generated first quarter GAAP net income of $106 million, representing a 17% margin, our sixth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. First quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.08 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.04.  Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 57% in the first quarter, a 3-point increase to our Rule of 40 Score from the prior quarter. We will continue to strive to maintain this exceptional balance of top and bottom line performance.  Turning to our cash flow. In the first quarter, we generated $130 million in cash from operations and $149 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a margin of 20% and 23%, respectively.  In Q1, we also repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares as part of our share repurchase program. As of the end of the quarter, we have approximately 990 million remaining of the original authorization. We ended the quarter with $3.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. treasury securities. We retain access to additional liquidity of up to $500 million through our revolving credit facility, which remains entirely undrawn.  Now turning to our outlook. For Q2 2024, we expect revenue of between $649 million and $653 million and adjusted income from operations of between $209 million and $213 million. For full year 2024, we are raising our revenue guidance to between $2.677 billion and $2.689 billion. We are raising our U.S. commercial revenue guidance to an excess of $661 million, representing a growth rate of at least 45%. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to between $868 million and $880 million. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow of between $800 million and $1 billion, and we continue to expect GAAP operating income and net income in each quarter of this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks, and then Ana will kick off the Q&A. Alexander Karp : Welcome to our Q1 earnings. I think it is fair to say we crushed Q1 in the U.S. We are on fire. You see this in our rule of 7 -- our Rule of 40 being 57, you see it in, the 68% (sic) [ 69% ] growth in U.S. commercial, if you do apples-to-apples following a 70% growth last quarter or 71% if you do apples-to-apples, taking out SPAC revenue. You see it in the deal growth in the U.S. growing from 70 to 136 in a year. You see it in the general enthusiasm around our products, especially in commercial, but also in government, which has begun to reaccelerate. You see it in general in our customer growth in U.S. comm, which grew 69%.  And again, we are growing these numbers while maintaining a Rule of 40 Score of 57, which basically means we're doing the impossible. We are growing the company while investing in our core IP or software development. We are winning in the U.S. And then that kind of asked -- then leads to the question of why are we doing so well in the United States of America? And the main reason is we built software infrastructure that allows enterprises, both commercial and government, to move beyond chat, move beyond self pleasuring to actually produce things that are valuable and whether this is tasking satellites in the commercial context or changing margins or changing American workers into Japanese engineers using our software platform and large language models. You can -- we believe -- I believe we are the only company in America, the only really relevant market that will allow you to do useful things with large language models. And that is what's generating 68% growth in U.S. comm, again, with a nascent sales force, doing it in a way that is not kind of playbook specific, thin technology, it barely works, and you have a sales force, but with 10 years of IP that presupposed LLMs before LLMs existed.  You see the same thing in the government, Shyam and others will talk about it, but our mission footprint, whether it's in Ukraine, Israel or in the United States government is stunning. There is basically no conflict in the world that is not -- that where Western allies are involved and the battlefields involved and the stakes are life and death, where Palantir is not the first call. And our ability to do this going forward is going to be even stronger because of the -- of past investments and also the unity of our culture and the strength of our leadership and in general, 20 years of understanding how to do this. It is true that it is mystifying to people, including analysts, how could this possibly be working? But it is working.  And this is the sixth quarter of profitability, the sixth quarter of profitability. I dare, remind people that there was a time when no one thought we'd be profitable, when no one thought we could crack commercial, where revenue per person was called into question, that also grew roughly 26% year-on-year. Revenue per person generated at Palantir. We do have headwinds in Europe, 16% of our business in Europe. Europe is gliding towards 0% GDP growth over the next couple of years. That is a problem for us. There is no easy remedy for that. It is also the case, though, that U.S. comp surpassed U.S. -- European commercial and we see that as favorable. And I, in general, think this is just Palantir's time.  Now there are lots of questions about why we are so active in defending the values of the West. The -- our belief that the West is a superior way to live and our ways of organizing around that are the reason why our products are transformative. The reason why we have the best people in the world. The reason why Palantir degree as it were is much more valuable than an Ivy League degree, before the Ivy League even embraced the thin and new woke religion otherwise viewed as an intellectual cause, but in fact, is a way of organizing things so that the greatest institutions of our time disappear and turn into discriminatory dysfunction.  Palantir is a counter example. And I'm super proud of the results. We are going to continue to execute, especially in the U.S., and I'm very happy to have you on the call. Ana Soro : Thanks, Alex. We'll now turn to questions. We received a few questions from our shareholders about AI and competitiveness. Matthew and Ryan asked, how does your AI strategy differ from your competitors? Shyam Sankar : Well, we're executing our strategy at an unrelenting pace here. If you go back to the launch of AIP, I discussed how we thought the models were going to commoditize and that's really borne out. We see that underscored with LAMMA-370B being released now. But the real opportunity for us, as Alex made mention of, is that people are using LLMs incorrectly in the enterprise. And as far as I can tell, we're really the only company to figure out how to help our customers get beyond chat, leveraging the investments that we've made in ontology, really harnessing this pattern of implementation where you're taking unstructured inputs and turning them into structured actions and outputs that drive economic value in the enterprise.  Now there's this thing that some companies have started saying where only 10% of my customers have data that's even AI ready to begin with. I think that's completely wrong. Maybe they don't have something to sell in the present moment so they're trying to sell in the past. But if that was right, how is it that in a single day boot camp, we're able to add value on top of our customers' messy extent data. Ultimately, software that works.  And to the present moment, I'm focused on helping enable builders in the context of the enterprise. I made mention of the DoD Hackathon, where a single user built in AIP logic function, surface and GAIA assist that took a targeting process down from 6 hours to 10 seconds. More generally, in commercial, with Build with AIP, we are releasing a slew of tutorials, quick starts and reference implementations that are going to help turn every customer, every user into a builder to unlock the potential of what they can harness on top of AIP. And that's the way ahead, and that's why we're still ahead. Alexander Karp : And I would say, I don't believe we have competitors. So I don't believe in the U.S. commercial market, we have competition. I don't believe in the U.S. government market, we have competition. I don't -- I think that's the reason Ukraine and Israel bought our product. We are differentiated because in order to actually make AI work, you need an ontology. No one has an ontology. To Shyam's point, you have a lot of people running around saying the data isn't ready. Of course, it's not ready because they don't have foundry. If you have foundry and the ontology, it is ready. If you have foundry or Ontology and Apollo, you can actually work at the edge. If you don't, you can't. And it's -- outside of America, there's still -- we would still have to convince people of this. Inside of America, we're not really convincing people that we have the only thing that works. We're showing up. We're showing it working. And we're saying this is what it costs, and it's working really well. But I -- currently, I don't believe we have competition. We have a lot of people who are like the Palantir of Iowa or the Palantir of Harvard or the Palantir of Uruguay, but they're not Palantir. And it's going to take a long time to actually build what we have because you'd have to actually understand what is special about the software infrastructure of having the combination of Apollo foundry and the ontology. And then you would have to build on top of it so that you can actually do these handoff functions with large language models.  And luckily for us, there is not a consensus at the investor level, VC level or among analysts that we have the only thing that works because -- and that means there's just going to be very little investment in comping and doing what we do. And investment in what we do outside of America would be hard to do anyway because the ecosystem, a term I don't particularly like, to get this done is in America. So you would have to do this in Silicon Valley and Silicon Valley is focused on, to Sean's point, the wrong things. Ana Soro : Our next question is from Dan with Wedbush. Shyam Sankar : So good, great quarter. My question is, can you just talk about what conversion looks like from boot camps? And maybe just double-click, on a typical customer, now that you have more and more data points, what's that showing you about conversion from a boot camp to actually signing a deal? Ryan Taylor : Yes, absolutely. I can talk to that. So we announced boot camps 2 quarters ago as a go-to-market motion. And we're seeing that play out as you see that in the results. So in 1 to 5 days with the boot camp we're able to do what used to take 3 months,  and we're seeing -- as I talked about, we're seeing customers shortly after boot camp signed 7-figure deals, and we're seeing the ability to be able to show them what they can do on the platform with real data much more quickly and then have that monetization conversation much sooner.  And so then you see that in the results, 69% growth in customers in U.S. commercial. We closed 136 deals in Q1 this year compared to 70 deals in Q1 last year in U.S. commercial. That's a 94% year-over-year increase. And so we're seeing it's still early in the process, and we're seeing the results from the boot camps and seeing that they're working in the monetization from them. Alexander Karp : The boot camps also have, quite frankly, another massive advantage because de facto it sets a standard that will be very hard for any other company to meet. So even if you don't buy our product, you de facto have locked in an idea of what's possible. And that means that at some point when you go try your own thing and it fails, you've seen, okay, well, I've seen the art of the possible. And therefore, I'm going to go buy it from Palantir at some point in the future. The boot camp motion is an early motion. And I don't think we would say we've cracked the sales motion. In fact, I think our 68% or 94% growth on deals or 69% on customer you have to look at this as we are at the way early days of figuring out how to actually get customers to buy our product. We are good at educating customers on what is the art of the possible and then some portion of those customers buy it.  So I expect as we get better and better at that, our numbers will increase. But it is really early days. It's not -- we're not flawlessly executing on our sales motion. And I would say I saw this when we built our anti-terror platform. One of the most important things we did is go out and educate the world about how you could fight terror and maintain civil liberties. And most people, we actually offered our platform to did not buy the product year 1, but by year 5, they all bought it.  And they bought it because they're like, okay, well, we see how you could integrate data across disparate data sets, maintain a security model, fight terrorism and being in conformity with the law. And even if you say, \"Oh, I'm going to go try to do this myself\", in fact, you can't. And then that sales motion -- so the integral -- the relevant integral for this is not just what you closed in the quarter. It is kind of throwing a carpet on the whole market and saying, okay, well, this is the standard. If you can do better than this buy it yourself, build it yourself, acquire it from other people. And if you can't come back to us, we're here. And that worked very, very well. I mean almost every country in the world, not every country, but almost every country in the world that could buy our core anti-terror product at some point did. Ana Soro : Our next question is from Mariana with Bank of America. Mariana Perez Mora : So it's also in the line of implementation, but less about the customer because I think the demand you're seeing in some percent that -- and we can see that you're seeing that both sides, like from the government side and the commercial side. What I'm really curious about is if you can give us some color around what is next in terms of actually making -- tackling this demand and implementing the efforts in supporting a way larger customer base. What is hiring? Where is partnerships? What is next there? And what is the most challenging from your point of view? Shyam Sankar : Well, I can certainly take that. Maybe Ryan will have some comments on the partnership side and the growth of that ecosystem. But on the product side, this is one of the reasons I'm most excited about, Build with AIP and the boot camps that we're running after we have deals with customers. We're really igniting a movement within the customer in terms of unleashing their builders and tackling use cases. There's been a shift like we still love to work on our customers' hardest problems and most important use cases to deliver crushing value very quickly, but concomitant with that is how do we enable every single one of their builders to get going. And I can think of the most recent, say, 2 quarters, our ability to come in there, help them solve one problem, but ignite hundreds of use cases that they're able to do on their own. So really even without needing additional partners leveraging repeatable reference implementations, reference architectures, quick starts, tutorials that get them going again and across different -- we have these for all the industries that we're working in for all the functions within these customers and including in government itself. Ryan Taylor : And on the partnership front, you see -- we announced our partnership with Oracle. We're seeing hyperscalers that are realizing that in order to drive compute, you need to move beyond chat, right? You need a solution that's taking organizations beyond there -- for their AI strategy beyond chat, we're seeing that happen there, and we're expanding the partnerships across the space with partners implementing at our customers as well. Alexander Karp : We have, across our company for the first time, ongoing discussions with hyperscalers that are well known with others where we're basically saying, look, we have the ideal product, you have the ideal distribution. You can build on top of our product and then capture your distribution at a higher margin. We're having discussions like this in Japan across UHG, but we have our efforts to provide our core infrastructure to defense tech start-ups, which are going very well simultaneously allow us to expand our core architecture or software development into the DoD, but also make us less competitive with people, which helps us a lot.  So a lot of what slows us down is people pretending they're competing with us. So finding ways to build partnerships with those people so they don't compete, accelerates our revenue. And in U.S. comm, it's a lot of what Shyam was saying. It's we are allowing customers to do what we had to do in the past, which is supply Palantir software engineers. They're just not that many Palantirian. So we can't scale. We have to allow -- encourage and provide a platform where they can do it. And I would say what you see both on AIP and on foundry is de facto customers using our product pretty much on their own. And that's again why you see a revenue growth up to 26% compared to last year on per-person revenue because we're making more money with the same number of people but roughly. So -- and that's precisely because of these things that we're doing. And so that has a lot of benefits for us, both alignment and quality of revenue. That's why you have this rule of -- that's why we have 57 on the Rule of 40. That's why our revenue is growing per person. That's why we can get away with sales that are not perfect and we're thinking a lot about how to do that. Ana Soro : Thank you. Turning back to a question from our shareholders. A lot of people have noticed that Palantir is pretty outspoken when it comes to geopolitics. How has this been received? Alexander Karp : Well, it's a complicated question because I think internally -- I mean there have been people who have disagreed. There have been people who have disagreed to the point where they've left, and this has gone on over the last 20 years. When we refused to walk away from special forces, the U.S. Army, when we took over Maven, when we refused to stop working with Homeland Security, when we had discussions about which countries you should work with and which countries we wouldn't. More lately -- more time -- in a more timely version when we supported Ukraine, it was less controversial. When we sold Israel our software that was arguably more controversial.  The fact that we -- that I take, I think the central risk to Palantir and America and the world is a regressive way of thinking that is corrupting and corroding our institutions that cause itself progressive but actually -- and it's called woke, but is actually a form of a thin Pagan religion. That is a real danger to our society. And it is a real danger to Palantir if we allow -- if we don't discuss these things.  The reason we have, by far, the best product offering in the world is because we have, by far, the best alignment around how to build software, what it means to build software, full alignment with our customers. A view that some -- the western way of living is superior and therefore, it should be supported by the best products.  People at this table have been in the trenches for over a decade each. Why do they stay? Why do they fight? Why do we come and do these calls? Why are we fighting for individual investors? Why are we -- why do we actually care about revenue growth in quarter? I mean, honestly, everyone at this table has a lot of money. It's like we care and we fight for these things because we believe we are fighting for a stronger, better, less discriminatory wealthier, more open and better society by providing the friends of the West U.S. industry, U.S. government, our allies, with by far superior products. And that's, by the way, how we -- you would be -- and that's how we align with our customers.  By the way, I have customers who disagree with me, but they sure as hell know, I'm telling the truth about what we believe. And probably, more importantly, they know we're not a [ sophist ]. They know we believe in things. And that's why we fight for this culture, and that's why we fight for our products. And that's why our products are growing. Again, you can repeat all these numbers over and over again.  How do you get 68% growth in U.S. comp with the 57 Rule of 40? How do you nearly double your customer count, your deal count, your customer account, all these numbers? You do it by having full alignment and the best products in the world. Or you can do it by having weird things that barely work and trying to manipulate clients into buying your product until they realize it barely works because it's thin and of no value.  And that's just not how we roll at Palantir. So it has been really -- and by the way, on the last note, how do we have the best investors in the world, especially individual investors? Why do they stick with us when times were hard? Why do they fight for Palantir? Why do they -- every time someone writes something [ unique ], Palantir has gone [ MAGA ], Palantir doesn't have a product. Palantir doesn't have margins. I'm sure this quarter, Palantir's growth is decelerating despite the fact it's obviously -- I mean we're obviously crushing it in America. Palantir is too crazy. Palantir will never be profitable. Palantir can't IPO. Palantir is too weird and odd to produce something that will be disruptive.  We knew it was bulls t. The people who are out on the front fighting against that BS, fighting against lazy inept discriminatory in the sense that's ignorance, people maligning Palantir, do it in great part because they believe that we are fighting for them, and we are. And we're fighting for ourselves, and that's why we have such a great company. So thank you. Ana Soro**: Thank you. That concludes Q&A for today's call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ana Soro : Good afternoon, I'm Ana Soro from Palantir's Finance Team and I'd like to welcome you to our Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market closed and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our third quarter and fiscal 2024 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance, and other statements regarding our plans, prospects, and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation, and other earnings materials are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call. Ryan Taylor : We are thrilled to report tremendous results for our business, driven foremost by strong execution in our US commercial business and continued US government business acceleration. Overall revenue growth, excluding strategic commercial contracts, accelerated to 30% year-over-year and 10% sequential in Q2. Our exceptional results are a reflection of a market that is quickly awakening to a reality that our customers have already known, we stand alone in our ability to deliver enterprise AI production impact at scale. We are delivering these results in the face of an unprecedented enterprise AI opportunity. As noted by Sequoia, the revenue expectations from the AI ecosystem's infrastructure build-out have grown from $200 billion to $600 billion per year in just nine months. The world is struggling with this huge problem. There's a great bottleneck between prototype and production. The world has also come to understand what we've been saying all along. The standard playbook does not and will not work. It cannot solve this problem. While many companies can build prototypes, the leap from prototype to production is substantial. Palantir has made that leap. Our focus is on deploying enterprise AI in production, solving meaningful problems for our customers. We have the right products at the right time and our history means that we understand the $600 billion opportunity unlike anyone else in this space. We are uniquely situated and you see that in our results now. Last quarter, we signed 27 deals worth $10 million or more and closed nearly $1 billion of TCV. One of the most notable indicators of our delivery is the volume of existing customers who are signing expansion deals, many of which are a direct result of AIP. We continue to see the greatest transformation in our US commercial business, evident in the many AIP-driven deals closed last quarter. Our US commercial revenue, excluding strategic commercial contracts, climbed 70% year-over-year. Our US commercial ACV closed was up 44% year-over-year and up 19% sequentially, while our deal count in US commercial was nearly twice what it was just a year ago. We maintain conviction in our ability to land new customers and subsequently expand those engagements as we sharpen our focus to taking our customers across the chasm from prototype to production. Tampa General signed a seven-year expansion, deploying AIP to deliver a care coordination operating system, where we've helped them reduce patient length of stay by 30%. Panasonic Energy of North America signed a three-year expansion using AIP across finance, quality control, and manufacturing operations. AARP shared they're utilizing AIP to provide targeted personalized experiences for their 29 million unique visitors on a monthly basis. Eaton deepened our relationship, leveraging AIP to modernize ERP deployments in addition to finance, sales, and supply chain use cases. Kinder Morgan signed a five-year Foundry and AIP enterprise expansion with production use cases including storage optimization, pipeline integrity monitoring, and power optimization. These are just a handful of the significant expansions last quarter into production with AIP. And the magnitude of expansion is notable. A major North American industrial company started working with us in late 2022, expanded to a $5 million run rate in 2023, and further deepened engagement to a $20 million run rate this year. One of America's leading hospitals began working with us in 2021, generated approximately $1.5 million of revenue in 2022, over $4 million of revenue in 2023, and is on track to generate nearly $15 million of revenue this year. With regard to landing new customers, US commercial customer count grew 83% year-over-year last quarter. Bootcamps remain a key go-to-market motion, particularly for prototyping what is possible with AI, but the real opportunity and our unique capability lies in moving from prototype to production with these customers. That is where we are focused. We closed a seven-figure deal with a large wholesale insurance brokerage firm for an initial production automated policy review use case just 16 days after the bootcamp. A leading convenience store chain went from prototype at a bootcamp to paid pilot in 25 days, then converted the inventory management and pricing optimization use-case into initial production immediately following the pilot. Our product charisma remains unparalleled. We plan to leverage this combination of bootcamps and pilots with a focus on moving towards high-value production use cases to continue landing new customers. At the same time, we are heightening our concentration towards building deep production-level relationships with every single customer. The phenomenal strength of our US government business shows the power and scale of our enterprise software delivery. Our US government business continued accelerating, growing more than 8% sequentially for two consecutive quarters. We proudly received several notable awards last quarter, including a production contract from the Department of Defense, Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office, CDAO, to deploy and scale an AI-enabled operating system across the DoD, starting with an initial order of $153 million to support certain combatant commands and the joint staff, while additional awards can be made up to $480 million over a five-year period. This award reflects the criticality of our software and our nation's defense capabilities. Shortly after, CDAO announced a new initiative, Open DAGIR to enable defense tech companies, traditional contractors, and government developers to develop applications and integrations on top of Maven powered by Palantir in a contract worth $33 million. We maintain pride in the mission-critical impact of our products and celebrate the long-term strength of our US government business evident in last quarter's results. Looking ahead, I've never felt more bullish about our business than I do today. We're charging full steam ahead, leading our customers across the bridge from prototype to production with our ever expanding product capabilities laying the paths for that journey. I'll now turn it over to Shyam to share more details. Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Ryan. Our customers have been ahead of investors and markets. Customers choose us not because we're delivering proofs of concepts, but because we deliver proof, years of foundational investments in our infrastructure and in particular in oncology, I will note a widely ignored and discounted innovation have put us in the pole position. GenAI has made prototyping incredibly easy and charismatic but with the same utility of a PowerPoint slide. The journey to production as the market is now discovering is fraught and requires a foundational set of technologies that we have uniquely invested in, creating the product pipeline that's needed to harvest economic value from AI. And that's a journey that we were pathfinders on with the US Department of Defense starting in 2018 and one we continue to be the leaders in across both segments, government and commercial today. The bottleneck and the transition from prototype to production is a very hard set of technical problems. We didn't build those technologies eating berries in San Francisco. We had to be on the factory floor in the foxhole, eating pain with our customers, seeing the secret truths of what does and doesn't work and metabolizing it into product. This has always been the secret of Palantir. It is the anti-playbook. Today's AIP developers will be the enterprise's next generation of builders. Apollo delivers eye-watering agility and responsiveness, AIP deprecates back-end development the same way that hyperscalers deprecated infrastructure, providing the mechanism to bring AI into production in the enterprise quickly. Our builder investments are feeding our product pipeline with our customers, developers in the wild. Compute modules have enabled the integration of our customers' own containerized applications into operational workflows. Today, this technology is powering exquisite missile warning systems in the US government and sophisticated production plan optimization across commercial. And ontology SDK has enabled customers to build their own pro-code applications backed by ontology, the critical ingredient for harnessing LLMs in the enterprise. And we pulled all these investments together in code workspaces, where we have enabled an end-to-end development environment that lets customers treat their business as code. These investments have made us the emerging choice not only for application developers but also data scientists. Our platforms have become the fastest place for our customers to develop, refine, and manage not only their models but integrated offerings that deliver business impact. Once again, history is repeating itself with data scientists as they abandon the thin playbook products of the past. We recently hosted two champions road events, one in Denver and one in Munich that pulled together the most experienced and prolific customer developers to share the latest on our roadmap, but more importantly, to service new opportunities to go deeper. At bill.palantir.com, developers in the US, UK, Canada, and India amongst a growing list of countries can now access a free developer tier in a library of quick starts, tutorials, and reference implementations for themselves. This developer movement is matched on the government side, whether it's with developers in Armed Forces Ukraine or the US Army. In government, CDAO's recent contract award on Maven will enable us to scale those exquisite capabilities to the DoD enterprise and to bring integrated JADC2 capabilities across space, cyber, electronic warfare, and logistics. The CDAO Open DAGIR contract also enables defense tech companies, traditional contractors, and government developers to leverage Apollo and the ontology software development kit OSDK to develop applications and integrations on top of Maven, all powered by Palantir's mission manager. And finally, fresh out of the AIP product pipeline, we are launching a new offering, Warp Speed, to power American reindustrialization. The software playbooks have also failed in manufacturing. And all the founders driving reindustrialization know it. This is why SpaceX built their own ERP. We created Warp Speed from our years of experience on the factory floors, helping customers build planes, trains, automobiles, and even ships. Today, we power production of jet engines, satellites, and weapon systems in the industrial base. Warp Speed, built on AIP, on our industrial AI, and with ontology is the modern American manufacturing operating system that reimagines how to bend atoms better with bits. At the dawn of World War II, we didn't have a defense industrial base. We had an American industrial base. Chrysler made missiles and General Mills wasn't just a cereal company. This is also what our future must look like. It is clear that the nation must reindustrialize and mobilize at Warp Speed to win. This platform will transform production in the value chains that power our kill chains. I'll turn it over to Dave to talk us through the financials. Dave Glazer : Thanks, Shyam. Q2 was an exceptional quarter. Revenue growth accelerated to 27% year-over-year, exceeding the high-end of our prior guidance by 5%, driven by the strength in our US commercial and government businesses. On the back of this strength, we are increasing our full-year revenue guidance midpoint to $2.746 billion, representing a 23% year-over-year growth rate. We delivered these tremendous top line results while expanding adjusted operating margin to 37%, highlighting the strong unit economics of our business. We also delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability, generating a record $134 million of GAAP net income, and our sixth consecutive quarter of GAAP operating profit, generating a record $105 million of GAAP operating income. Our revenue and profitability drove a 7-point sequential increase to our Rule of 40 score from 57 in the first quarter to 64 in the second quarter. Turning to our global top line results, revenue continues to accelerate. We generated $678 million in revenue, up 27% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, second-quarter revenue grew 30% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. Customer count grew 41% year-over-year and 7% sequentially to 593 customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. Second quarter trailing 12-month revenue from our Top 20 customers increased 9% year-over-year to $57 million per customer. Now moving to our commercial segment. Second-quarter commercial revenue grew 33% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $307 million. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, commercial revenue grew 40% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Second-quarter commercial TCV book was $377 million, representing 31% growth year-over-year. Our US commercial business continues to see unprecedented demand with AIP driving both new customer conversions and existing customer expansions in the US. Second-quarter US commercial revenue grew 55% year-over-year and 6% sequentially to $159 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, US commercial revenue grew 70% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. In the second quarter, we booked $262 million of US commercial TCV, representing 152% growth year-over-year. Total remaining deal value in our US commercial business grew 103% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. Our US commercial customer count grew to 295 customers, reflecting 83% growth year-over-year and 13% growth sequentially. We generated $148 million in international commercial revenue in the second quarter, representing 15% growth year-over-year and 1% sequential decline as a result of continued headwinds in Europe. We continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East, and beyond. Revenue from strategic commercial contracts declined to $9 million for the quarter. We anticipate third-quarter 2024 revenue from these customers to continue to decline to between $6 million to $8 million compared to $15 million in the third quarter of 2023. We continue to anticipate 2024 revenue from these customers to be less than 2% of full-year revenue. Shifting to our government segment, second quarter government revenue grew 23% year-over-year and 11% sequentially to $371 million. Second quarter US government revenue grew 24% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $278 million. As Ryan mentioned, we're selected for several notable awards in Q2, which led to the strongest US government bookings quarter since 2022, reflecting the growing demand for our government software offerings. Second quarter international government revenue grew 21% year-over-year and 18% sequentially to $93 million, primarily driven by additional funding from a partner nation related to our ongoing efforts in Eastern Europe. The second quarter TCV booked was $946 million, up 47% year-over-year. Net dollar retention was 114%, an increase of 300 basis points from last quarter. The increase was driven both by expansions at existing customers and new customers acquired in Q2 of last year. As net dollar retention does not include revenue from new customers that were acquired in the past 12 months, it does not yet fully capture the acceleration in velocity in our US commercial business over the past year. We ended the second quarter with $4.3 billion in total remaining deal value, an increase of 26% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, and $1.4 billion in remaining performance obligations, an increase of 41% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business. Turning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense was 83% for the quarter. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, was $254 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 37% and marking the seventh consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins. Q2 adjusted expense was $425 million, up 4% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. We continue to expect the expenses to ramp through the back half of the year as we invest in the product pipeline and hard technical problems in debottlenecking the journey from prototype to production that Shyam just outlined. We remain focused, however, on calibrating expense growth below revenue growth for the full year in order to continue delivering on our goals of sustained GAAP profitability and operating income. In the second quarter, we generated GAAP operating income of $105 million, representing a 16% margin, our sixth consecutive quarter of GAAP operating income, and fifth consecutive quarter of expanding GAAP operating margins. We generated second-quarter GAAP net income of $134 million, representing a 20% margin, our seventh consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. Second-quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.09 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.06. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 64% in the first quarter, a 7-point increase to our Rule of 40 score from the prior quarter. Turning to our cash flow. In the second quarter, we generated $144 million in cash from operations and $149 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a margin of 21% and 22%, respectively. We expect cash flow to ramp through the back half of the year, in line with expected timing of government and commercial year-end collections. Through the end of the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares as part of our share repurchase program. As of the end of the quarter, we have $973 million remaining of the original authorization. We ended the quarter with $4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term US treasury securities. Now turning to our outlook. For Q3 2024, we expect revenue of between $697 million and $701 million and adjusted income from operations of between $233 million and $237 million. For full-year 2024, we are raising our revenue guidance to between $2.742 billion and $2.750 billion. We are raising our US commercial revenue guidance to in excess of $672 million, representing a growth rate of at least 47%. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to between $966 million and $974 million. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow of between $800 million and $1 billion, and we continue to expect GAAP operating income and net income in each quarter of this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks, and then Ana will kick off the Q&A. Alex Karp : Thank you for participating in our earnings. We founded this company to be a ray of light to America and our Western allies. And in doing so, we built software for the institutions as they ought to exist, not as they do exist. And of course, the whole playbook around building software, building institutional software, building software that would be transformative and especially in the current context around AI and large language models flew in the face of everything that people have been taught to know about enterprises, what makes them work, how they can transform themselves, what software products would be valuable, what software products people would adopt, how would they adopt them, how would you get value from analysts, users in the software context? How would you transform manufacturing? How would you use in the current context large language models not as an act of self-flagellation or something that just makes a small group of people richer, but in a way that you can extract value in existential life and death context like the battlefield or in institutional or commercial context like the transformation that is happening all across America and in some other countries. And in the face of this, we made bold claims that looked ridiculous to many people. One bold claim was these large language models will not work without foundational software. They will not work without a means to process them. They will stay something like self-pleasuring or PowerPoints, which is the purveyor, which are sold to institutions as a way of deceiving institutions from transferring their high-value revenue to other enterprises without actually transforming themselves, which were addictive and thin and led to dysfunction in enterprise -- enterprises, much like their allegory in the political world wokeism became slower, dumber and not able to actually produce results. And we built the infrastructure you need to move from self-flagellation, PowerPoints, and prototypes flawlessly into production. Production, meaning your enterprise gets faster, it runs better, the margins are better, the people inside the enterprise become more valuable, your tribal knowledge in your enterprise, the knowledge which differentiates you from all other enterprises becomes truly valuable, it becomes a weapon in your hand, whether that weapon is in the commercial context to make what you know how to do better than anyone else, work better than anyone else by making engineers better, by making the workers more able to do things, engineers would be able to do by treating your company as a portfolio as opposed to dots on a PowerPoint. We believed and the numbers now show that we were right that by doing this we could give America and its allies a structural advantage in the commercial area, which we have seen and our numbers prove and arguably even more importantly on the battlefield, which we can't talk as much about, but is the absolute most important area where America and its allies have to have dominance and leadership that we had a structural advantage. And what is gratifying about our -- this quarter and in general about what we've done is not the banality that we were right and the playbook purveyors are obviously somewhat laughable, it is that you can build a great business, be aligned with America in the West, that that alignment will make you stronger and better, that your software products will actually be products in our PowerPoints. And that you can actually build something with the best people in the world, the best investors in the world that will lead to structural advantages. Of course, all along the way, we had many, many doubters. We had people that thought we would never be profitable. We had -- now we are over seven quarters in profitability. We thought people that we would never be able to grow the revenue. We'd never be able to reaccelerate the US government because of its often opaque, but we asserted that product superiority would overcome many of the vicissitudes and difficulties of working with the US government witness reacceleration. We asserted that our products were the precursor to making LLMs valuable, that we would productize how you create this value much the way hyperscalers, as Shyam had mentioned, have productized other technical issues, and that we would give those -- that productization to our customers, witness our 70% after SPAC quarter -- the third quarter in a row where we're growing at -- would amounts to a ridiculous rate. And there's -- witness the reacceleration of our global business ex SPAC to 30%. Witness our backlog, look at any part of our business, then it is like, well, how are we doing this is a really long and interesting question that people will dedicate their academic careers on, but we do not have time to address and it may not be learnable for everyone, but we do it. And the single most important part, however, of this is that we are going to play a determinant role in making America and its Western allies the dominant force again on this world -- in this world. And because of that, the best times for this company are not in the past. I would say the single most interesting thing about this quarter, if you had to reduce it to one simple fact, after 20 years, after changing the way people do Intel, after changing the way the battlefield works, after changing the way people procure software, after exporting our platforms to our allies, after punishing our adversaries, after building a commercial business, after DPOing, after seeing it all reaccelerate, the best times for us are yet to come and we are planning to just take our energy and run this business as a business of which we are, which is our owners. We are owners with a very long-term focus for the best interest of our country, our allies and our Palantirians, and our investors. And so I'm very thrilled to have you participate in this -- what for us means historic earnings. And last not least, the world is on the precipice of what could be a very severe -- a set of violent interactions in the Middle East. And it goes without saying that at Palantir, we know where we stand and we are very much supporting America and its allies in the Middle East, including Israel. Thank you. A - Ana Soro : Thanks, Alex. We'll now turn to a few questions from our shareholders before opening up the call. Axel asks, what is Palantir doing to be different from its AI competitors, and what is the company's plan to stay competitive? Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Axel. Well, all the value and where the market is completely bottlenecked is on that transition from prototyping to production. And that happens to be the place that we are most differentiated. That differentiation is built on more than a decade of deep technical investments. Technologies like the ontology, OSDK, the primitives that we have that permeate the platform, security, functions on objects, actions, write-back, machinery, automation, and a deep product pipeline that really is focused on addressing this very problem on this transition from prototyping to production. And I think when you think about the ChatGPT moment, it's so very clearly invalidated the thin product playbooks of the past. I think this bottleneck is doing that same thing to AI software. It is so easy to create an AI prototype, the equivalent of effort of making a PowerPoint slide, but it's actually very, very hard to get that in production, probably 10 to 100 times harder than traditional software transitioning to production. And therein lies our entire opportunity in the market. That's what you see with the expansions that have happened with Panasonic Energy and Tampa General. And that's what you frankly see in the numbers of this quarter. Ana Soro : Thanks, Shyam. Our next question is from Jacob, who asks, we understand why Foundry has become the operating system for the modern enterprise. How does this change with LLMs? Shyam Sankar : Well, the market doesn't need point solutions even if it's slightly addicted to them and our customers can't solve their business problems with hyperscaler infrastructure alone. They need a system that organizes and orchestrates the interaction of their physical business with their technology with AI and LLMs. In the same way that your operating system orchestrates and organizes your hardware with your applications. And in the same way that your operating system gives you application development frameworks like AppKit for Mac or WinUI for Windows, Palantir's OSDK and ontology is that application development framework for the entirety of your business, that allows you to treat your business like code, leveraging the primitives that we've built that extend LLMs throughout your enterprise. Alex Karp : And just as a point that we've already mentioned, but a lot of what we're doing sounds complex on the outside, but what is not complex is the customers already understand they need it. So it's like a lot of our actual advantages, the customer is way ahead of investors, way ahead of people investing this, and we also and we're way ahead of our customers and we have distribution. So typically in a revolution, the revolution comes from like small companies somewhere, but this revolution is coming from being ahead of where the customers are and the customers are years ahead of what analysts and others think. And we are actually monetizing simply the fact that we're ahead of our customers and the years ahead of everyone else. And all these things that Shyam was talking about, how does an ontology work within [SDK] (ph)? How does that work within enterprise? How would you actually use a large language model in a way where it's differentiated, meaning you use the right large language model at the right time under the right conditions in the logic, meaning in the way the business understands itself under the -- within the context of the security and security logic of the business. Those things are largely not understood on the outside, but every single person in government who is trying to use them or who is using them, every single customer who's buying this witness the numbers, they either understand this overtly or they understand that nothing else works. And in many cases, they simply understand that nothing else is giving them any value and they're increasingly getting tired of paying for things they either don't use or they shouldn't use. Ana Soro : Thank you both. Our next question is from Dan with Wedbush. Dan, please turn on your camera and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Daniel Ives : Look, I think historic quarter for Palantir, so congrats. Does it feel out and team -- does it feel like you're starting to now in terms of the conversions from the Bootcamps to deals, it's starting to accelerate. It seems like that based on the actual quarter, but can you just give -- grant some granularity there? Alex Karp : Do you\u2026 Ryan Taylor : Yeah, I can give. First of all, I think the numbers speak for themselves. We closed 27 deals worth more than $10 million or more, $1 billion of TCV in quarter. And so I'll start with the numbers because they speak for themselves. Bootcamps are an important part of that motion. We're seeing them expose customers to new opportunities and new potential customers to opportunities. That being said, it was -- as Shyam was highlighting, what everyone underestimates is the immense challenge of deploying enterprise production AI software at scale. And so we're very much focusing our energy and going deep in production with those customers and that's the massive opportunity before us and that's where we're running at full speed. You see that in the numbers, you see that in the customers' reaction who are blown away by the impact we're having for them and demanding more and more in that direction from us and really where we're focusing at. Alex Karp : Maybe a slightly orthogonal indirect way of answering your question is if you take the battlefield, where these things -- the few places these things are LLMs are in use or the battlefield where other forms of AI are in use and you take US commercial. What you're really seeing is a very tight learning circle, what works, what doesn't, why. And that's very different than places that aren't working. In America, it has many businesses that are very strong and they're very, very agile, so they're learning very, very quickly. And then much like people watching this call, they're like, okay, this is working, there were leaders like you who predicted this would work, but most people actually -- our customers want to see it in production and then say, okay, well, why is this working, and that's a separate. And what's very special about what's happening now is you have more and more people who are like, okay, I know this works, I want to understand exactly why and how would I expand it and why is nothing else working. And so that's leading to a very different motion. I think it's going to lead to a very different way of looking at our company in all areas, including financial areas because it's like when you're making assertions, you need avant-garde innovators to look at it and say, okay, well, this is something that's not quite there, but I think it could work. And we're very much moving into the phase of, yeah, this is working. Our adversaries know this works, our US military knows this works, people on the ground know and it's a very similar in US commercial. And that's what's generating the 70% number that is kind of jaw-dropping. Like, the jaw-dropping numbers are being generated by, okay, this works, how do I expand and explain to me how it's working, can we expand these things? And by the way, our innovation is also because we're like, okay, we see this works, but this could work five times better if we had different kinds of innovation that no one else has. Ana Soro : Thank you. Our next question is from Mariana with Bank of America. Mariana, please turn on your camera and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Mariana Perez Mora : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to try to squeeze two questions as usual. So the first one, I'm curious about Warp Speed, what is it? Is it like a new system that allows companies to build their own ERP system? Is something that runs on top of your existing old-school legacy ERP system or is Palantir creating like a solution that is ERP? Like a little bit details about that. The second one is not just Warp Speed, but also all this American industrialization. GAO posted a report recently where they've said software and implementation are the two biggest barriers for the US to be able to produce the weapons that they need. What is the biggest barrier or like hurdle for the US primes or the -- especially the old guard primes to come to you and let you help them reindustrialize, produce, and get back on track on these like multi-billion dollar contracts they have? Thank you. Shyam Sankar : Yeah. Thank you, Mariana. So with Warp Speed, it really is a -- we conceive of it as an operating system for the modern American manufacturer. It touches not just ERP, but also MES, PLM, PLCs, it's interacting with the factory floor. We think there's an opportunity to reimagine this. I think the kind of congenital defect for most of this software, it was designed historically in the 70s for the CFO. Why would you do that? If you're starting over today, you would build software that was designed for the Head of Production that was focused principally on production and then how you integrate both your extant legacy systems and use Warp Speed in place of the investments that you haven't made. I think the big opportunity, so if you go to the big legacy manufacturers and you say this, it sounds crazy. They've made a bunch of historical investments. They're not yet convinced or even aware of the fact that the legacy software playbook doesn't work. But if you go to new manufacturers, the one that are powering the reindustrialization of the country, they all know this. They're all alumni of the Tesla, SpaceX world where they built their own systems from scratch, principally because the other stuff doesn't work at all. And they also know they can't afford the 300 engineers it would take to build this completely from scratch or the time it would take to do that. So this is a very powerful role of taking AIP, building the applications on top of it using the OSDK, and delivering the integrated suite of applications that are also malleable to the business because I think one of the other key insights here is, it's not actually believable that the same ERP manufacturing system that you use to build rockets is what you would use to build rackets. And how do you -- what is the right way to think about grafting the software around the manufacturer in a way that gives them alpha, not just creates a huge amount of services for these system integrators? We live in a world today where it's $1 of license for $9 of implementation that never seems to quite work. Who is really happy with the implementation of these systems? Which ones are even happening on time? Who can say that those systems didn't fall apart in 10 seconds when COVID supply-chain disruptions happened, right? There's an entire opportunity to reinvent this now and I think the bolus of energy around national defense and reindustrialization is catalyzing this opportunity. Alex Karp : Well, and Shyam is leading this charge, but the reason it -- I think is likely to work is because not just America, but every allied nation is -- has the problem that they cannot get their military production to work. So the -- your question is not really two questions. It's what are you building from my perspective and why is it likely to work? And they're very linked. It's likely to work because in every single Western country, when you talk to these leaders in private, the conversation I often have with them is what could we possibly do to make manufacturing work, so we will actually be competitive on the battlefield. And the answer to that is for these countries really is reimagine how you produce. And the people who do it are going to be people who are alumni of the companies that have actually built companies correctly, call it the Palantir alumni, and people from the SpaceX network are really the only people who have done these things. And the first thing they want is a software program that will allow them, including with large language models and AI, to build the way you ought to build. Ought does not mean build near-term in the interest of your CFO, so you can IPO quickly and build something that's fake. It means build something that is real, build something that's sustainable, build something where the production is actually production of a product. And that aligns very squarely with how Palantir wins and how we build things. And that's why this is a super important thing we're working on. Ana Soro : Thank you. Alex, as always, we have a lot of individual investors on the line. Is there anything you'd like to say before we end today's call? Alex Karp : Well, again, thank you for your support that we've had good and bad times. This is a super important time for Palantir because we have proven to the world that what we do is quantifiable and real. We are focused on growing this company to be much more impactful, much larger, and much more valuable. And we appreciate your support and we know that many of you also support us because you realize that we are value aligned with your values, which means fighting to make the West a stronger and better place, including on the battlefield. And that battlefield is may be upon us now and we appreciate your support and do what you can to help America and help our allies. Thank you. Ana Soro : Thank you. That concludes Q&A for today's call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ana Soro : Good afternoon. I'm Ana Soro from Palantir's finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market closed and posted on our investor relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance, and other statements regarding our plans, prospects, and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures, is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation, and other earnings materials are available on our investor relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call. Ryan Taylor : Our results are exceptionally strong. Revenue grew 30% year-over-year in Q3, driven by an intensifying AI revolution that the U.S. is rapidly driving. Our U.S. business achieved 44% year-over-year and 14% sequential revenue growth. We are focused on deploying AI models in production, amidst the commoditization of cognition caused by the rapid advancement in AI models. Our U.S. government business revenue growth accelerated to 40% year-over-year and 15% sequentially, while our U.S. commercial business momentum continued with 54% year-over-year and 13% sequential revenue growth. This AI revolution that is transforming industry, as well as government is also transforming markets. In September, the S&P 500 added Palantir to its index, a testament to our exceptional growth, profitability and market leadership amidst this singular era of accelerating technological progress. We're witnessing the commoditization of cognition with the rapid advancement of AI models. Almost all investment in the AI space has been focused on supplying and improving these models. What will differentiate the AI haves from the have nots, is the ability to maximally leverage these models in production by capitalizing upon the rich context within the enterprise. This is Palantir's focus. We see this in the results we're delivering for our customers. Those who embrace quantified exceptionalism through AIP are able to take advantage of the commoditized cognition in a levered way to advance their differentiation. In this winner take all AI economy, the divide is widening between those who are leveraging AIP and those who are not. At a leading global insurance organization, AIP has helped automate key underwriting workflows, reducing the typical underwriting response time from over two weeks to 3 hours. We implemented over 10 business use cases in just nine months at Associated Materials, increasing its on time in full delivery rates from 40% to 90%. At Trinity Rail, it took just three months to get to a functional workflow with a $30 million impact to its bottom line. Last quarter, we closed 104 deals, over $1 million. The evolving deal cycle as we take customers from prototype to production is having a particularly phenomenal effect on the growth of our U.S. Commercial business, which continues to see AIP driven momentum both in expansions and new customer acquisitions. In U.S. Commercial, we closed nearly $300 million of TCV and customer count grew 77% year-over-year compared to 37% year-over-year in Q3 2023. To highlight a few notable deal cycles, a large American equipment rental company expanded its work with us less than eight months after converting to an enterprise agreement, increasing the account ARR 12 fold. A bottled water manufacturer, a specialty pharmaceutical company and an agricultural software provider all signed seven figure ACV deals less than two months after their initial boot camps. In our U.S. Government business, we are outfitting our warfighters with advantages over our adversaries. Last quarter marked our U.S. government businesses continued strength through the end of the U.S. government fiscal year. It was our strongest sequential growth in 15 quarters, driven largely by our DoD businesses 21% quarter-over-quarter growth. We remain proud of our progress delivering the next generation Targeting Node through Titan with our efforts fully ramping throughout Q3. Palantir is also delivering AI through Maven Smart System, allowing customers like the 18th Airborne to match the performance of what used to be a 2,000 staff targeting cell during Operation Iraqi Freedom to a targeting cell of roughly only 20 people today. Last quarter, Palantir signed a new five year contract to expand these Maven Smart system AI ML capabilities across the U.S. military services including the Army, Air Force, Space force, Navy and U.S. Marine Corps. As Vice Admiral Frank Whitworth recently said, this partnership is tantamount to ensuring that we keep America safe and ready. The AI revolution is underway now. The chasm between the AI haves and have nots is rapidly widening and the whole world is watching. I'll now turn it over to Shyam. Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Ryan. The divide between AI haves and have nots is rapidly accelerating in this winner take all AI economy. What will differentiate the AI haves from the have nots is the ability to maximally leverage these models in production by capitalizing upon the rich context within the enterprise. That's why our focus on delivering proof, not proof of concepts continues to pay-off. Years of foundational investments in our infrastructure and in on ontology have positioned us uniquely to harness and deliver on AI demand. This is Palantir's focus. The market has been focused on AI supply the models. We see this clearly in the progress, but also in the capital sunk into these models. Indeed, the models continue to improve, but more importantly, the models across both open and closed source are becoming more similar. They are converging, all while pricing for inference is dropping like a rock. This only strengthens our conviction that the value is in the application and workflow layer, which is where we excel. Tapping into this rapidly expanding pool of leverage from AI labor means more than just saving money. It means a massive acceleration of results for our customers. As Ryan mentioned, we have automated the insurance underwriting process for one of America's largest and most well-known insurers with 78 AI agents, taking a process that took two weeks to 3 hours. More than the labor savings, this presents the customer with an asymmetrical advantage in the marketplace to bind contracts before the competition has even gotten through 15% of their process. In U.S. government, we automated the foreign disclosure process for sharing critical and timely intelligent with allies from three days to 3 hours. The center for Security and Emerging Technologies at Georgetown published a study on Maven that showed how the entire targeting and fires process can be done in Maven with 20 people it used to take 2,000. There is a huge opportunity for our customers to automate the tail and liberate capital to reinvest in the tooth across government and commercial, we see enterprise autonomy as a key theme in our proof. Our deep investments in CJADC2 Combined Joint All Domain Command & Control continue to meet their moments. First and foremost, Maven has powered responses to real world events across the globe. This past quarter the army was the first military department or MILDEP to adopt Maven. We're happy with the progress that we continue to make with Army Titan and AIDP and Palantir's role as the application integrator in the Joint Fires Network. Maven is our military's fight tonight solution at a time when North Korean troops are in Ukraine, Russia is providing satellite intelligence to the Houthis and Iran is launching ballistic missiles at allies. We are investing aggressively to expand the perimeter to give our warfighters the unfair advantage they deserve, advanced multi-INT sensor fusion, integrated logistics into fires and large scale command and control of swarms of autonomous systems. We announced warp speed last quarter, our modern American manufacturing operating system. We as a nation must reindustrialize to prevent escalating conflict and regain deterrence. Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, only 6% of major weapons systems spend went to defense specialists, the so called primes. 94% went to dual purpose companies who were invested in both freedom and prosperity. Chrysler built cars and missiles, Ford built satellites until 1990 and General Mills, the serial company made weapons. Today, that 6% has become 86% when including firms whose only commercial exposure is in aerospace. We won World War II and the Cold War with an American industrial base, not a defense industrial base and we need to bring that back at warp speed. And in addition to working with new champions like Anduril and Shield AI, we're also working with L3Harris and two other of the big primes to help them bend atoms better with bits. Lastly, we continue to invest in AIP as a developer platform. Green suitors at the 18th Airborne Corp built 15 applications in our developer environment for their August warfighter exercise. Army Software Factory is cranking out software at units in Europe and even for the Vice Chief of Staff of the army. The 101st built their search and rescue common operating picture to power Hurricane Helene response, built entirely by uniformed service members. We have released our JADC2 SDK including examples and documentation for government and third-party developers to start building on@palantir.com/defense/sdk and we have DevCon this month, our first gathering specifically for AIP platform developers across commercial and government, where we will be releasing a ton of new product investments, an enhanced OSDK, more ergonomic compute modules, the multimodal data plane and much more. I'll turn it over to Dave to talk us through the financials. David Glazer : Thanks, Shyam. Q3 was an exceptionally strong quarter, as revenue growth accelerated to 30% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by nearly 450 basis points. As America rapidly embraces the AI revolution, this increase in AI demand has driven the outperformance in our U.S. business, which grew 44% year-over-year. Our U.S. commercial business grew 54% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Our U.S. government business grew 40% year-over-year and 15% sequentially, a seven fold increase compared to the prior year period growth rate and the strongest growth we've seen in 15 quarters. On the back of this strength, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance midpoint to $2.807 billion representing a 26% year-over-year growth rate. We delivered these outstanding top line results, while expanding adjusted operating margin to 38%, highlighting the strong unit economics of our business. Our revenue and profitability drove a 4 point sequential increase to our Rule of 40 score from 64 in the second quarter to 68 in the third quarter. We had an exceptional cash flow quarter with cash from operations of $420 million and adjusted free cash flow of $435 million representing margins of 58% and 60% respectively. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated over $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow for the first time in the company's history. We are also proud to have joined the S&P 500 last quarter, underscoring our sustained profitability and growth. Turning to our global top line results, revenue continues to accelerate, as we see continued momentum from AIP. We generated $726 million in revenue, up 30% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, third quarter revenue grew 32% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Customer count grew 39% year-over-year and 6% sequentially to 629 customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. Third quarter trailing 12 month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 12% year-over-year to $60 million per customer. Now moving to our Commercial segment. Third quarter Commercial revenue grew 27% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $317 million. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, Commercial revenue grew 30% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Third quarter Commercial TCV booked was $612 million, representing 52% growth year-over-year and 62% growth sequentially. Our U.S. Commercial business continues to see unprecedented demand with AIP driving both new customer conversions and existing customer expansions in the U.S., as we continue to deploy AI models in production. Third quarter U.S. Commercial revenue grew 54% year-over-year and 13% sequentially to $179 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, U.S. Commercial revenue grew 59% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. In the third quarter, we booked $297 million of U.S. commercial TCV, representing 13% growth sequentially. Total remaining deal value in our U.S. commercial business grew 73% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Our U.S. commercial customer count grew to 321 customers, reflecting 77% growth year-over-year and 9% growth sequentially. We generated $138 million in international commercial revenue in the third quarter representing 3% growth year-over-year, but a 7% sequential decline as a result of continued headwinds in Europe and a step down in revenue from a government sponsored enterprise in the Middle East. Despite those headwinds, we continue to build on our transformational work with some of our largest international customers, including signing a multi-year renewal with BP. We also continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle east and beyond. Revenue from strategic commercial contracts was $9.6 million for the quarter. We anticipate fourth quarter 2024 revenue from these customers to decline to between $6 million to $7.5 million compared to $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. We continue to anticipate 2024 revenue from these customers to be less than 2% of full year revenue. Shifting to our Government segment. Third quarter Government revenue grew 33% year-over-year and 10% sequentially to $408 million. Third quarter U.S. government revenue accelerated to $320 million, representing 40% growth year-over-year and 15% growth sequentially. This acceleration was driven by continued execution in existing programs, new awards reflecting the growing demand for AI in our government software offerings and favorable deal timing in the quarter, coupled with government year-end cycle. Third quarter international government revenue was $89 million, representing 13% growth year-over-year, but a 5% sequential decline as a result of revenue catch up in Q2 that we noted last quarter and less favorable deal timing. Third quarter TCV booked was $1.1 billion, up 33% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Net dollar retention was 118%, an increase of 400 basis points from last quarter. The increase was driven both by expansions at existing customers and new customers acquired in Q3 of last year, as we see the effect of the AI revolution in both industry and government. As net dollar retention does not include revenue from new customers that were acquired in the past 12 months, it does not yet fully capture the acceleration and velocity in our U.S. business over the past year. We ended the third quarter with $4.5 billion in total remaining [Technical Difficulty] yield value, an increase of 22% year-over-year and 4% sequentially and $1.6 billion in remaining performance obligations, an increase of 59% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business, as it does not take into account contracts within an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business. Turning to margin and expense, adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense was 82% for the quarter. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes was $276 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 38% and marking the eighth consecutive quarter of expanding adjusted operating margins. Q3 adjusted expense was $450 million, up 6% sequentially and 14% year-over-year, primarily driven by our continued investment in AIP and technical talent. We continue to expect expenses to ramp through the fourth quarter as we invest in the product pipeline and accelerate the journey from AI prototype to production. In the third quarter, we generated GAAP operating income of $113 million, representing a 16% margin. We generated GAAP net income of $144 million, representing a 20% margin. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.10 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.06. As previously communicated, we've aligned our compensation program with the performance of the company's goals, including its stock price. On the back of the company's strong performance, our inclusion in the S&P 500 and the increase in our stock price, we will continue to monitor if we become required to accelerate stock-based compensation expenses if certain market based vesting criteria are achieved earlier than expected. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 68% in the third quarter, a 4 point increase to our Rule of 40 score from the prior quarter. Turning to our cash flow. In the third quarter, we generated $420 million in cash from operations and $435 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing a margin of 58% and 60% respectively. For the first time ever, on a trailing twelve month basis, we generated over $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow representing a margin of 39%. Through the end of the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares, as part of our share repurchase program. As of the end of the quarter, we have 954 million remaining of the original authorization. We ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. treasury securities. Now turning to our outlook, for Q4 2024, we expect revenue of between $767 million and $771 million and adjusted income from operations of between $298 million and $302 million. For full year 2024, we are raising our revenue guidance to between $2.805 billion and $2.809 billion. We are raising our U.S. Commercial revenue guidance to an excess of $687 million, representing a growth rate of at least 50%. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to between $1.054 billion and $1.058 billion. We are raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance to an excess of $1 billion and we continue to expect GAAP operating income and net income in each quarter of this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks and then Ana will kick off the Q&A. Alex Karp : Given how strong our results are, I almost feel like we should just go home. But we -- we made -- we've been saying since we went public in a DPO that we would build infrastructure to make America and its allies the dominant force in the world. We claimed to too much skepticism that this would be done in a software product, that defense and commercial industry would be driven by software, hardware, hybrid technologies that there were very few companies in the world that could actually do that, that these companies are basically only built in America that the companies that have tried to do this that aren't Palantir are built by ex-Palantirians. That the financials of Palantir would flow from our products and our culture and our way of implementing that we would bring violence and death to our enemies, while making targeting and general issues of safety better for our allies and for Americans, that we would stand by our values in thick and thin, including that the west and America are superior ways of organizing and that this is a great country and historically anomalous in its greatness and that we would build a company with the best people from all over the world, but primarily from America to power America and its allies. And even we are shocked by the 44% growth in the U.S. off of a $2 billion base. So this is not some speculative small base 44% growth. Even we are happy to see that we grew 30% to see the real reacceleration in U.S. G to 40% and to see the very, very strong results in U.S. commercial. Also allied countries that have begun to realize that AI is the way to wait in which to make their defenses superior in the face of brutal, heinous, immoral and often terroristic enemies where you need a superior form of fighting that's both safer for you and more dangerous for the adversary and controls how you hit them and when and where and allows you to maximize your results. It is also just jarring to see how America adopts the most important, most agile and most impactful technology, independent of who the purveyor and builder of that. We are building this company and we are -- we believe we're at the beginning and watching American adoption both in Government and Commercial, while not forcing us to change, while accepting that many of the ideas of how we have of how to make your enterprise better, whether it's insurance has been mentioned, oil and gas, any kind of complicated manufacturing, supply chain, healthcare, obviously defense and Intel that that a new and different way of building software and implementing it, meaning the infrastructure is where the value is. Despite the fact that as we, you may have noticed, many have noticed that the experts that write about these things seem to believe the commodity i.e. the LLM is the valuable aspect of this and that the actual asset, meaning how you manage the commodity is the actual value despite great skepticism about our view of how to do this, the market seems to have decided what works, no matter how theoretically appealing the idea is of building software around how you may have learned to build it in business school is to you as the person not buying the software. The people buying the software who are allowing our market to grow at 30% in aggregate, 44% in America, 40% in U.S. Com and dramatically 40 in U.S. Government and dramatically in U.S. Com are, are, have, are speaking with their feet and their implementations and we're very, very proud of that. And I'm particularly proud to see the warfighter adoption of this. You see every part of U.S. government, including the White House, Congress, Defense, intel, beginning to embrace the application of large language models in infrastructure, obviously something that Palantir is particularly specialized in. And we just, we are really, I think as a company enjoying this phase. When you build a company over long period of time, there are good and bad phases. But to see in fact, our view of what it makes to make enterprises stronger and better show up in these dramatic results is super gratifying and we plan to continue. Ana Soro : Thanks, Alex. We'll now turn to a few questions from our shareholders before opening up the call. We received a few questions on AI. How will Palantir differentiate its AI offerings from others, including the model creators? And how is AIP different? And how will Palantir maintain its competitive edge? Shyam Sankar : Well, Alex talked about how the models yellow arms are commoditized, but if you look at the models, you see that they're getting better, which is awesome. But they're also getting more similar across both closed and open source models, while they're improving, they're converging upon each other, all while the price of inference is dropping precipitously. And that's, so if you even look at these model companies, they have to build applications around these models to extract value. That's where we have a decade long head start. We've been building the forge to create and implement AI applications at scale throughout the enterprise. And that differentiation starts with the ontology. Using the ontology to drive AIP across these applications. When you look at the legacy software companies, I'm not sure they understand it yet, but when you look at the innovative Silicon Valley companies, they recognize the wall of tech investments this implies that's in front of them that's going to act like a great filter. Alex Karp : I would say kind of an addendum to that, it's, it's. Well, first of all, I think people are beginning to recognize we were right and these numbers show it. So that, that creates a dynamic of, okay, well, if you can actually extract value from large language models in any context, then clearly the company that does it is very valuable and a lot of our customers, even a year ago, they were kind of skeptical of can you make these things useful? I would say most of the customers I deal with are pretty skeptical, you can make large language models do anything, but do a science experiment. And in a weird way, even though the models are improving, they're meeting up against greater skepticism among clients because clients have tried them and it's just a high school experiment. And then if you get to -- so it's like there's the market and analyst seem to have put a lot of credibility into the models and we do too. We think they're very valuable when managed correctly, when used in a way that an enterprise can understand. And one of the problems that people have is if you're not involved in enterprise software, it's very hard to understand how an enterprise actually works. You cannot take a large language model that gives you an ELO score of 1200 and use it on targeting on the battlefield. There's a security model. There's a way in which the data is understood. There's certain things you can't share. There's places you would use certain models, but not others. How do you bring that back to your corpus of truth to understand, in a lethal context who dies and who doesn't? And you have very similar use cases in underwriting and in healthcare. And so understanding the actual way, technically Enterprise is driven as embodied by Foundry, as embodied by our abstraction layer on top of Foundry, which includes all those new launches which we call in ontology as powered by AIP are all sorts of things that our clients are being beginning to discover every day. Of course, the main way they're discovering it is, holy shit, (ph) I can do this in an hour that used to take 5 hours or 50 hours or I could have 2,000 people or 20 and 10. And by the way, on the targeting on the battlefield, we've talked about basically two orders of magnitude and reduction of people, but it's also in many cases two orders of magnitude in the production of your ability to do things in efficacious manner. There are whole global events now that would be very different without these, without our ability to manage these things in our infrastructure. And that's obviously generating a lot of excitement internally that spills into our earnings. Ana Soro : Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan, who asks, as Palantir continues to invest in new AI technologies and expand globally, how are you balancing these investments with maintaining or improving profitability and operating margins, especially given the current macroeconomic challenges? David Glazer : We aren't just bouncing, we're excelling. Revenue grew 30% year-over-year in Q3, 44% in the U.S. in the quarter. And you couple that with our expanding margins in the quarter. We did 38% adjusted operating margin, our eighth consecutive quarter of expanding margins and we posted 68 in, 68 in the Rule of 40 score. At the same time, we had an outstanding adjusted free cash flow margin in the quarter, 60%. And so looking forward, we're raising guidance. We're raising guidance for adjusted free cash flow to an excess of $1 billion for full year 2024. We're raising adjusted operating income guidance to an excess of $1 billion, well over that actually, which represents a 39% margin in Q4. And we're doing all this while we're continuing to invest at the beginning of the AI revolution that is -- there is an incredible amount of demand there and we're investing in technical talent and we're continuing to build out world class product. Alex Karp : There's a steel man version of this, which is given how well you're doing, given you've really accelerated to 30%, given the U.S. is growing 44%, why don't you blow up your Rule of 68, which by the way, to my knowledge is the single best in of comparable companies in the world and significantly better than many very strong companies. So an average normal way of looking at Palantir be like, great, you have a 44% growth on $2 billion base in the U.S. and you have a Rule of 68. Get that 68 down to 50 and maybe you can grow. But in fact, that way of looking at a business misunderstands the way in which Palantir builds. We believe that by investing and we know at this point, instead of trying to have 10,000 clients, all of whom hate you, that's kind of what people want, 10,000 clients that hate you, but they can't give you a product. We want a smaller number of the world's best partners that, quite frankly are dominating with our product. And the way you do that is by having by not blowing up your margin and getting 10,000 sales people, it's actually by going deeper on the product. And in fact, what we see is the deeper and the better the product, the more we drive sales, the more we have our cultural singular advantage as Palantir, not as a commodity product. It's like we are not a commodity. We do not want our customers to be commodities, we want them to be individual Titans that are dominating their industry or the battlefield. And we reflect that in how we do things. We are not trying to be your average Harvard Business School preferred company with like that, that crush that reduces the margins, has a thin product and then has a lower rule of 40 and presumably higher growth. By the way, I don't think you get higher growth than what we had, honestly, although we of course are always pushing and want even higher growth. The people who tend to ask these questions are, tend to be modeling companies with 20% growth and lower margins. We have 44% growth in the most important market in the world, arguably not the only, but by far the most valuable market in the world, while having a Rule of 68 i.e. the best in the world. And we are going to maintain the contradiction of having both high margins and high growth. It's not one or the other. They're actually interplayed and they're not a contradiction. They power each other. That's how you have world class products. That's what you see in your numbers. A - Ana Soro : Thank you both. Our next question is from Dan with Wedbush. Dan, please turn on your camera and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Daniel Ives : A great quarter and congrats to you and the team. So my question is with boot camp conversions, has it even surprised you just how quickly from a customer coming into a boot camp, potential customer to conversion to megadeals, what you're seeing and what do you think that says about your process and where we are in this AI revolution where Palantir year sits? David Glazer : Yeah. I think obviously the most indicative of what we're seeing and the impact is the results, 44% year-over-year growth in U.S. Commercial. 54, sorry, 44% year-over-year growth in U.S., 54% in U.S. Commercial the sequential growth we're seeing. I think, I gave examples of boot camps where we're seeing multiple different customers across different industries that are going from, from the initial boot camp to a seven figure ACV deal within a matter of less than two months. We're seeing that, we're feeling that in the conversations we have with customers and then our push to go from prototype to production and the expansions we're seeing at customers. And I'm seeing that, in the conversations, as we said, really, it's going to be, it's going to be the AI haves and the have nots. The haves are moving quickly, making decisions quickly and adopting quickly and I'm feeling that in the conversations we have with them, in the conversions we're seeing. Alex Karp : I would just say that the most surprising thing is just how there's a small number of increasingly large number of customers, meaning that get this and they are just moving really quickly and anyone who's involved in the enterprise. So if you take company XYZ and then five people go to a different company, the first thing they do is pick up the phone and call us. And then and so it just the way in which this just expands in the U.S. quite and in some other countries, but especially in the U.S. from anyone who touch this wants to use it in any part of anything they're doing. And it goes from one person. And then there's this transience in America where people really are moving to different companies a lot and they're talking to each other. And there's just a willingness to take business metrics and use those business metrics against technology. That's not ideological. And if you look at even 10 years ago, there was no form of software that had this kind of adoption and this kind of readiness. And also it was conversely just not possible to show this kind of results this quickly. And we tend to focus on the results on the outside, but in, AI and large language models also allow us to scale our product on the inside. So one of the unfair things about this revolution is if you have business acumen and you have a product that is good or stellar, in my humble opinion, you can make it even better internally and externally. And so that allows us to also scale many, many more people to many, many organizations with the same number of people, as long as they're the best in the world. And so it's really this from touch to expansion. However we do it, some of its boot camps, but some of it's just like, hey, I used to work at a company, I heard really good things about your product, I want it tomorrow. How quickly can you get here? What is the first use case you could do? And then the first thing that they always ask is, well, show me some of the things that you've done in other places like I even cross fertilization between government and non-government, I was at an important government entity a couple of weeks ago and they obviously Maven would be very useful for them. But then they start asking, well, what are you doing for hospitals? Could you use this on FOIA requirements? Could you use the same thing for managing our people? How could you make sure that our people are safe and happy? How do you move parts? How do we do procurement? A lot of the things shams, so there's like a massive cost fertilization even between verticals that otherwise would never talk. In the past, government use cases did not, non-government use cases were just not things we were doing in government and certainly from industry to industry, we did not have this from real estate to supply chain to large hospital things, the use cases that they're doing inside our product, they are technically basically the same for us. Ana Soro : Thank you. Our next question is from Mariana with Bank of America. Mariana, please turn on your camera and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Mariana Perez Mora : Good afternoon, everyone. Alex Karp : Hi. David Glazer : Hey. Alex Karp : We can't see you, but it's okay. Mariana Perez Mora : Okay. New camera and stuff. Alex Karp : Okay. Mariana Perez Mora : So on government, U.S. government is up like 40% and this is in line with what we saw at USA L3Harris, Andrea, Chile, but others were advertising Palantir logos and they were like advertising partnership with you. What change for them to actually want a partner? That's the first one. And then Dave, if you don't mind giving an update on the strategic commercial contracts and how are you thinking about the remaining deal value as we see news about Lilium, but also a recent pickup of some like stock awards as a form of payment from these companies. Thank you. Ryan Taylor : On the first bit here, there's really two dimensions to what we're seeing is acceleration in partnerships on the U.S. government side. The first is something I've talked about earlier, which is mission manager, really how do we take not our software, but our software infrastructure, Rubik's and Apollo as radical accelerants for these companies to get to revenue, to service their existing revenue in a more profitable way and expand their market access. So that's been just a clear win across the board, that's good for the government, it's good for these partners and it's good for us. David Glazer : I don't think Shyam is taking enough credit here or Shyam, Ake and others. So we -- one of our biggest issues in the U.S. Government would be just simply a friction coefficient. And we had the problem that although we are completely focused on helping the U.S. government allies first and our self-second and that's been, that's one of the reasons most of us at the table are still here. There was a general perception a couple of years ago that basically and you see it in our numbers Palantir wins and maybe we win too much and we keep winning and people are like the Palantir makes all this money, someone else has got to make money. And one of the thing Shyam and I would say Ake and others did a tremendous job of it's like look, we're in this for the supremacy of U.S., U.S. and its allies and we're going to prove this by opening up part of our products and allowing you to sit on government data, which is, laypeople assume you could just put a product on government data. You can't do that. There's all these tech products we've built that allow you to safely and securely work directly with the U.S. government. And we begun offering that to all sorts of defense tech start-ups and begun partnering with more established large integrators like L3 and many others actually. And the strategy there was, look, if we actually believe what we believe, let's show it. And this strategy, which, Shyam led and Ake empowered and also kind of spent, did incredible work on has led to a situation where most people involved in tech innovation now view Palantir as their ally. And so instead of going into every meeting saying oh yeah, Palantir is great, but their fearless leader is bad shit, crazy and he might go off to his commune in New Hampshire and whatever they were saying, it's now like, yeah, the products are the best and we have great products. And so that, that's a really important shift and that was a business strategy and it really was done by others and that has shifted our ability to get to market because most people don't want to resist. They don't, they're not hating the player, they're playing with us. Shyam Sankar : Alex, is always a tough act to follow, but the second part of that I'll just close out with is really helping these companies with their production. In the same way that we help Airbus build every plane or Chrysler build every car, how do we help L3 and roll and shield and all of these new entrants and existing primes build their weapon systems better and in particular where they have fixed price drive margin expansion as a consequence of doing that. David Glazer : And then on the strategic commercial contracts, they're a tiny part of the business, right, basically 1% of revenue in Q3, on the forward looking metrics which is even like it's quite de minimis and the program ended three years ago. So we can still answer the question, it's basically not relevant anymore. Ana Soro : Thank you. Alex, we have a lot of individual investors on the line. Is there anything you'd like to say before we end the call? Alex Karp : As usual, we're in it together with you. Besides making America even stronger and better and our allies stronger, better and all of us more lethal, besides protecting Palantirians and most ex-Palantirians that the -- our individual investors are near and dear to our and certainly my heart and I love it that you guys are winning. There always be ups and downs in building a business, but we're definitely fighting for you guys. And the decision to do a DPO where we which is essentially a, was a decision to make sure that individuals got to participate and your willingness to spend time and look at what we're doing and actually look at the facts on the ground and not just to read theory has been crucial to Palantir as a business and it's part of what makes Palantir great and also our nation so great. So thank you and thank you for your support. Ana Soro : Thank you. That concludes Q&A for today's call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ana Soro : Good afternoon. I'm Ana Soro from Palantir's Finance Team, and I'd like to welcome you to our Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market closed and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our first quarter and fiscal 2025 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance, and other statements regarding our plans, prospects, and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation, and other earnings materials are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call. Ryan Taylor : 2024 was nothing short of incredible for Palantir. Our momentum accelerated through year end, closing out 2024 with exceptional Q4 results, including an extraordinary top-line beat and outperformance led by our U.S. business. Revenue grew 14% sequentially and 36% year-over-year in Q4 and 29% year-over-year for the full-year. The AI revolution continues, transforming industries and redefining how organizations operate. AI is a pivotal component in driving innovation and efficiency, something companies need to embrace or fall behind. With the proliferation of AI models, the raw AI labor supply is exploding. While everyone else is focused on the model supply side, we're transforming AI into a measurable stream of high-value finished goods and services. The result, the rapid emergence of quantified exceptionalism for organizations able to unlock the potential of these commoditized models through AIP. A byproduct of our incredible progress, our Rule of 40 score increased to 81 in the fourth quarter. It's a substantial leap to deploy LLMs into production with real impact. Most organizations are currently stuck on the wrong side of the widening chasm, working on their two, five, and 10-year plans, which become obsolete days later failing to ever take action, but not Palantir or our quickly growing customer base. We've taken our position through our decades-long investment in developing the ontology, which allows organizations to seamlessly weave LLMs into their enterprise, unlocking their highest potential leverage. In this AI revolution, anyone looking for a solution that actually works is going to choose Palantir. Last quarter alone, we closed $1.8 billion of TCV across our business, which represents a 56% increase year-over-year. We closed a record-setting number of deals in Q4, including 32 deals worth $10 million or more. Our U.S. business is at the forefront of the AI revolution, growing 52% year-over-year in Q4. Last quarter, U.S. commercial revenue grew 64% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. AIP continues to fuel new customer acquisition as we have nearly 5 times the number of U.S. commercial customers as we did three years ago and significant expansion opportunities at existing customers. Organizations who have crossed the chasm with Palantir are driving real impact quickly. In this AI revolution, the biggest risk is not moving fast enough and organizations are looking to us. With Palantir, as soon as work begins, we're delivering real quantified exceptionalism for our customers. In my conversations, they're excitedly asking how we can replicate this success across their organizations. One of America's largest pharmacies has been a customer since early 2024 and signed a $67 million TCV engagement with us right after the pilot for workflows including automatically load-balancing prescription fulfillment and orchestrating patient outreach. An American telecom company became a customer approximately two years ago and recently signed a $40 million TCV expansion deal to help manage and accelerate their decommissioning of old network technologies and equipment in order to achieve significant cost savings. Last earnings call, we mentioned the leading global insurance organization that deployed AIP to help automate underwriting workflows, reducing a two-week process to three hours. That organization signed a nearly $11 million ACV expansion deal in Q4. Panasonic Energy North America is seeing the effects of its AIP expansion as they've created a maintenance assistant to help 350 technicians in making 5.5 million batteries per day, resulting in reduced machine downtime, greater throughput, and rapid onboarding of new technicians. In Q4, we also announced the customers in the inaugural Warp Speed cohort, which are using Palantir's Warp Speed to gain an advantage in aspects of their manufacturing operating system, including automated visual quality inspections and dynamic production scheduling. Anduril CIO, Tom Bosco, noted \u201cby using the software, we've seen up to 200 times efficiency gained in our ability to anticipate and respond to supply shortages\u201d. Our U.S. government business, the foundation on which Palantir was built is exceedingly strong with revenue growing 45% year-over-year last quarter. We take pride in supporting the critical missions we're delivering against. Notable deals included the U.S. Army extending its long-standing partnership with Palantir to deliver the Army Vantage capability in support of the Army Data Platform for up to four years. We also announced our recent contract expansion with U.S. Special Operations Command, marking the first deployment of Mission Manager to U.S. Special Operations Forces units. Our international commercial business continues to see pockets of growth alongside the large renewals of some of our long-standing customers. For example, Rio Tinto extended their partnership with Palantir for an additional four years, noting AIP is making their unstructured data accessible, allowing them to quickly attack problems previously deemed too complex. Using our software, network rail specialists coordinate 53 driverless trains, each with 240 wagons, ultimately improving throughput and safety. Our International Government business also achieved strong growth. Revenue increased 26% sequentially last quarter, driven in large part by the U.K., including our work with the NHS to roll out the Federated Data Platform as 87 Acute NHS Trusts and 28 integrated care boards have signed up to use it as of November 2024. We accelerated through the end of the year and we remain full throttle. We're at the dawn of this AI revolution and in this winner take all AI economy, Palantir leads the way. I'll now turn it over to Shyam. Shyam Sankar : Thanks, Ryan. For the last two years, we've been saying that even while the LLMs are improving, the models across both open and closed source are becoming more similar and performance will converge, all while the cost per token for inference continues to drop substantially, and that's because the market has been focused on AI supply, the models. With the release of DeepSeek-R1, that has gone from a contrarian position to consensus. It's now blindingly obvious to everyone. Our foundational investments in ontology and infrastructure have positioned us to uniquely deliver on AI demand. From the beginning, AIP was built for this reality. Chat was always a dead end. Instead, we viewed LLMs as a new runtime for the AI labor to capture the productive value of this AI labor, you need an intermediate representation of your enterprise that AI can actually interact with. How do you allocate inventory, onboard customers, process claims, call for prior authorization, and the like? That intermediary representation that makes all of that possible is ontology, and that's why it's been the secret to our meteoric rise. We are convinced the normative value for AI is enterprise autonomy, the self-driving company. Users go from performing the workflow to supervising an army of agents, teaching them how to handle edge cases and reducing 12-time, this is where we are maniacally focused with our customers. We've been working with a large multinational bank to automate core back-office processes. What used to take five days now takes three minutes. Much more than the labor savings, this improvement eliminates historical constraints on the middle office and now enables the bank to create entirely new and differentiated financial products. We're working with a top engineering and construction firm to automate the identification of risks across tens of thousands of pages of technical documents, replacing months of arduous manual reviews with AI labor that can flag major risks to engineers in minutes. And we're working with a large power systems company to automate the understanding of technical diagrams to turn them into quotes into orders. And finally, we're working with an automotive supplier to analyze CAD files for component designs to have AI labor validate engineering standards and manufacturability checks. That is a 100-hour process for human engineers, now automated and serving up exceptions for human review. The before and after with AI is stark and the speed of implementation is accelerating. You can divide companies up into two categories, the quick and the dead. Turning to Warp Speed, Palantir's modern American manufacturing operating system, it continues to move at Warp 10. Our nation is in the beginning of a great reindustrialization as we compete with China to secure a free world and individual liberties. This is a competition we cannot afford to lose. We announced our first cohort of Warp Speed customers, including Anduril and L3Harris. The response has been exceptional and the pipeline is swelling. Warp Speed integrates engineering, test, production, quality, and operations so that manufacturers can build better and build faster. Our FedStart Offering hit a major milestone with the approval of our FedRAMP High Environment for FedStart customers. This is radical acceleration, both in reduction of time and costs of market access for software companies in the federal space. Finally, in U.S. government, our deep investments in CJADC2 continue to deliver results. Maven continues to see significant adoption in his path finding new AI capabilities throughout the kill chain. Substantial new investments integrating contested logistics into MAVEN's AI-enabled kill chain met their moment in exercises in Q4. Adoption continues within the military departments, specifically Army, Air Force, and Space Force, as well as at the combatant commands with expansions at Spacecom, SOUTHCOM, AFRICOM, and Stratcom. While Hurricane Helene response galvanized the adoption of MAVEN on unclass beyond just the secret and top-secret networks, the adoption has continued to grow as MAVEN is used for securing our nation's border and securing our nation's airspace by enabling drone domain awareness. And MAVEN is reaching our allies and partners via U.S.-supplied capabilities called MAVEN REL, all spurred by real-world events and the need to collaborate in real-time in crisis. We are really just getting started with MAVEN and have an ambitious roadmap and a set of customer opportunities in front of us to deliver the unfair advantage our warfighters deserve. I'll turn it over to Dave to talk us through the numbers. Dave Glazer : Thanks, Shyam. We had an outstanding fourth quarter. Revenue growth accelerated to 36% year-over-year, exceeding the high-end of our prior guidance by over 900 basis points and representing a 1,600 basis point increase compared to the growth rate in Q4 of last year. America continues to rapidly embrace the AI revolution, and we saw this unrelenting demand drive impressive outperformance in our U.S. business, which grew 52% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Our U.S. Commercial business grew 64% year-over-year and 20% sequentially and our U.S. government business grew 45% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. On the back of this continued strength, we are guiding to a full year 2025 revenue midpoint of $3.749 billion, representing a 31% year-over-year growth rate. We delivered these outstanding top-line results while expanding adjusted operating margin to 45%, the strongest adjusted operating margin in the company's history. Our revenue and profitability drove a 13-point sequential increase to a Rule of 40 score from 68 in the third quarter to 81 in the fourth quarter. We also had an exceptional cash flow quarter with adjusted free cash flow of $517 million, representing a margin of 63%, and $1.25 billion in adjusted free cash flow for the full year, representing a margin of 44%. Turning to our global top-line results. Fourth quarter revenue grew 36% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $828 million. Full-year revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $2.87 billion. Full year U.S. revenue grew 38% year-over-year to $1.9 billion. Excluding impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, fourth quarter revenue grew 39% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, and full year revenue grew 32% year-over-year. Customer count grew 43% year-over-year and 13% sequentially to 711 customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. Fourth quarter trailing 12-month revenue from our top-20 customers increased 18% year-over-year to $65 million per customer. Now moving to our Commercial segment. Fourth quarter commercial revenue grew 31% year-over-year and 17% sequentially to $372 million. Full-year commercial revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $1.3 billion. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, fourth quarter commercial revenue grew 37% year-over-year and 18% sequentially, and full-year commercial revenue grew 36% year-over-year. We had a strongest quarter of commercial TCV booked at $995 million, representing 42% growth year-over-year and 63% growth sequentially. Our U.S. commercial business is seeing unprecedented demand with AIP driving both new customer conversions and existing customer expansions in the U.S. Fourth quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 64% year-over-year and 20% sequentially to $214 million. Full year U.S. commercial revenue grew 54% year-over-year to $702 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, fourth quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 76% year-over-year and 19% sequentially, and full-year U.S. commercial revenue grew 69% year-over-year. We also had our strongest quarter of U.S. commercial TCV booked at $803 million, representing growth of 134% year-over-year and 170% sequentially. This exceeded our next highest quarter of U.S. commercial TCV book by nearly $400 million, highlighting the increased demand for AI production use cases. Total remaining deal value in our U.S. Commercial business grew 99% year-over-year and 47% sequentially. Our U.S. commercial customer count grew to 382 customers, reflecting growth of 73% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. Fourth quarter international commercial revenue grew 3% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to $158 million, partially driven by revenue catch-up from a customer in Asia. Full-year international commercial revenue grew 9% year-over-year to $594 million. For International Commercial business, we continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East, and beyond, but remain focused on accelerating our growth in the U.S. Commercial business. Revenue from strategic commercial contracts was $9.6 million for the quarter. We anticipate first quarter 2025 revenue from these contracts to decline -- to between $4 million to $6 million compared to $24 million in the first quarter of 2024. We anticipate 2025 revenue from these contracts to be approximately half of 1% of full-year revenue. Shifting to our government segment. Fourth quarter government revenue grew 40% year-over-year and 11% sequentially to $455 million. Full year government revenue grew 28% year-over-year to $1.57 billion. Fourth quarter U.S. government revenue grew 45% year-over-year and 7% sequentially to $343 million. Full year U.S. government revenue grew 30% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. This acceleration was driven by continued execution in existing programs and new awards reflecting the growing demand for AI in our government software offerings. Fourth quarter international government revenue grew 28% year-over-year and 26% sequentially to $112 million, bolstered by our continued work in U.K. healthcare and defense. Full year international government revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $372 million. Fourth quarter TCV book was $1.79 billion, up 56% year-over-year and 63% sequentially. Net dollar retention was 120%, an increase of 200 basis points from last quarter. The increase was driven both by expansions at existing customers and new customers acquired in Q4 of last year as we see the effect of the AI revolution. As net dollar retention does not include revenue from new customers that were acquired in the past 12 months, it is not yet fully captured the acceleration and velocity in our U.S. business over the past year. We ended the fourth quarter with $5.43 billion in total remaining deal value, an increase of 40% year-over-year and 20% sequentially, and $1.73 billion in remaining performance obligations, an increase of 39% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business. Turning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense was 83% for the quarter and the full-year. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes was $373 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 45%. Full-year adjusted income from operations was $1.13 billion, representing margin of 39%. Q4 adjusted expense was $455 million, up 1% sequentially and 14% year-over-year and full-year adjusted expense was $1.74 billion, up 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by our continued investment in AIP and technical talent. We expect to see a more significant increase in expense in 2025 as we invest in technical hires, the product pipeline, and continue our focus on AI production use cases, all while delivering our goals of sustained GAAP profitability. On the back of the strength of our results, we want to congratulate our employees for the successful delivery of their market-vesting stock appreciation rights or SARs. As a result of this achievement, we accelerated $131 million of one-time expenses in the fourth quarter related to these equity awards. Fourth quarter stock-based compensation expense was $282 million and employer-related equity tax expense was $80 million. Full year stock-based compensation expense was $692 million and employer-related equity tax expense was $126 million. Fourth quarter GAAP operating income was $11 million, representing a margin of 1%. Fourth quarter operating income, when excluding one-time SAR-related expenses was $142 million, representing a 17% margin. Full-year GAAP operating income was $310 million, representing an 11% margin. Full-year operating income when excluding one-time SAR-related expenses was $442 million, representing a 15% margin. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $79 million, representing a 10% margin. Fourth quarter net income, when excluding one-time SAR-related expenses was $165 million, representing a 20% margin. Full-year GAAP net income was $462 million, representing a 16% margin. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share was $0.03 and earnings per share when excluding one-time SAR-related expenses was $0.07. Full-year GAAP earnings per share was $0.19. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.14. Full-year adjusted earnings per share was $0.41. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 81% in the fourth quarter, a 13-point increase to our Rule of 40 score from the prior quarter. Turning to our cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we generated $460 million in cash from operations and $517 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing margins of 56% and 63%, respectively. For the full-year, we generated $1.15 billion in cash from operations and $1.25 billion in adjusted free cash flow, representing margins of 40% and 44% respectively. Through the end of the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares as part of our share repurchase program. As of the end of the quarter, we have $936 million remaining of the original authorization. We ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. treasury securities. Now turning to our outlook. For Q1 2025, we expect revenue of between $858 million and $862 million and adjusted income from operations of between $354 million and $358 million. For full-year 2025, we expect revenue of between $3.741 billion and $3.757 billion, U.S. commercial revenue in excess of $1.079 billion, representing a growth rate of at least 54%, adjusted income from operations of between $1.551 billion and $1.567 billion, adjusted free cash flow of between $1.5 billion and $1.7 million, and GAAP operating income and net income in each quarter of this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks, and then Ana will kick off the Q&A. Alex Karp : Welcome to our Palantir Revolution, otherwise known as our earnings call. There really is a lot of debate about with these numbers, if you even should have an earnings call, but there was also a lot of debate around which number is the best internally. We were undecided whether our 29% growth in aggregate, our 38% growth in the U.S., our 54% growth in U.S. Commercial, our Rule of 81 -- they may have to redo the rule because when you're doing twice the rule, of course, maybe the rule isn't fair to other companies, we may have to have a different rule, the rule of 70 or something, but we blew through that over twice the Rule of 40. To say we did it our way is a minimization of what that meant. We have taken a long bet over decades around the assumption that if we built the products that our partners, most importantly, our partners in the West, most importantly, our partners in the U.S. ought to build, not what they wanted us to build, not what they mandated we should build, not what investors, venture capitalists or analyst were saying they would reward us for building that company would generate so much value and that we would get a small percentage of that and we would end up as a massive significant, and much more importantly, impactful company that could power the West to its obvious innate superiority, expose things that weren't working, rebuild the whole infrastructure of a company. We did that with many platforms most successfully, however, was our interest in figuring out how to power human-driven analytics with the assumption that what ought to come would not be human-driven, i.e., would be AI at some point, and that AI potentially could be something like a large language model. And what we've delivered to the market is a symbiotic relationship between data, computer, LLMs, organized, powered, made possible, made valuable by something we dared to call an ontology, which was in the beginning viewed as a highly obnoxious anti-chromatic team that people thought we were using to obfuscate bad financials. And that ontology and our willingness to stick to our guns, again, because there's been billions and billions and billions of dollars invested in large language models, the idea that you could dare to build a product that was built on the assumption that the power of large language models would be in their operas, the ability to operationalize them in the context of the enterprise in common language. So that was a revolution that we saw that we built against, that we've led, that we've got off the ground for us in America. We have 54% growth in U.S. Comm. We -- by the way, USG is now reaccelerated, it grew 30%. We are guiding above 30%, at 31%, and we're doing this in a very, very complicated environment. The part of the reason we've done so well is the experts look to the past as an indication of the future when we're looking to the future as an indication of the present, and it's very, very hard to figure out what's going to happen. We see as much as I personally care about the broader West, including Continental Europe, despite our best efforts and working on every day, it's anemic. We're growing around 4% on 13% of our company. It does look like the continent of Europe will look to the past as a way of getting to the future, struggles with the idea that all the valuable technology in this area is built in America. Perhaps struggles with the fact that to make LLMs work, you have to find a way to build something like an ontology. There's one available at Palantir. We have rejected all the way through anti-numericocratic concepts, anti-transparent concepts, we're at the forefront of civil liberties. One of the reasons ontology is so valuable is because the concepts that we built into PG that we built into foundry that are expressed in branching are concepts that both accelerate revenue, it get -- and decelerate, control CapEx, i.e., make the margins something like what you would find at Palantir, but do it in a way that actually make the enterprise better, healthier, more ethical. We at the end of the day at Palantir are exporting our culture and way of doing things to enterprises, especially in America, by allowing enterprises to capture their tribal knowledge in a way that they can utilize LLMs, i.e., take the commodity side of LLMs and hypercharge or specialize their secrets of their enterprise using the secrets of our enterprise, namely, how do you build product? How do you end up with ontology? How do you implement it? And last not least, we believe we are making America more lethal, making our adversaries increasingly afraid of acting against the interests of America and especially Americans and we are proud of our moral stance and we are very long on the U.S. and what's happening and what will happen in the future. And with that, we should open up our earnings call. This is obviously a very, very special time to be at Palantir. Palantirian\u2019s are very excited and I am -- yes, it's by far the best time to be at Palantir. One of the things that's crazy important about our time at Palantir now is, it's actually the vibe internally, the vibe with our clients, the vibe with inside of our products is, we are at the way beginning of our trajectory. We are at the way beginning of revolution and we plan to be a cornerstone, if not the cornerstone company, and driving this revolution in the U.S. over the next three to five years. Thank you. A - Ana Soro : Thanks, Alex. We'll now turn to a few questions from our shareholders before opening up the call. Our first question is from Christina, who asks, what is so unique about the ontology? How does it give you an edge over your competitors and why wouldn't any of them be able to recreate something similar? Shyam Sankar : Well, thank you, Christina, for the question. I think we could start by thinking about, if I was building software to solve problems for one company, well, you don't need an ontology, you just take the shortest path between A&D and that doesn't involve ontology. You could think about, okay, what if I'm building enterprise software for many customers in a traditional way, not a forward deployed engineering way where I have -- I'm thinking about it deductively, I have large multi-year implementations, never mind that those things never work, but the traditional software industrial complex, you're not even going to conceive of ontology. But if you have the ambition to build software that works across government, across 50 different industries, you have to build ontology, it is absolutely the longest path between Point A and Point B, but it gives you superpowers when you show-up to your customers, and it gives your customers superpowers when they're managing the change in their enterprise, mergers and acquisitions, finding the entropy of the universe, competing in the market. But what makes ontology essential is AI? Ontology ends up being the intermediary representation that makes your enterprise accessible to AI in a way that's governed and secure and provides you the observability that you need, so you can actually trust the AI, but more importantly, the observability your regulators need so they can trust in your transition to being a self-driving company. Alex Karp : Yes. And it also allows you to manage them so that the actual taxonomy and ability to put the large language model where it can be more exact, so it can be managed at scale. You could think of it as what we do on the foundry back end where we have to create pipelines is basically anti-segmenting the data. To get the AI to actually work in an enterprise, you have to re-segment, re-concatenate the large language models in a way where the use-case is thin enough that they can actually provide exact enough information and the concatenation of that is exact enough to provide real results in an enterprise context, meaning you can rely on the large language model to do the same thing 500 people would be doing who are experts in dealing with text and you can do that with three people. And then the question that Shyam is getting -- is answering is also, but why is it hard to build it? So now we know that Palantir is succeeding and has this pick your stat Rule of 81 growth with no basically a nascent salesforce, it's actually very hard to build, because in order to have an idea how to do this, you would have to have taken all the lessons of every single-product we built, including security models, including how do you interact with the data of an actual enterprise, how do you impose branching. And then you'd have to interact with that and build something to work with the large language models, not as they -- not as you thought they were, not as you'd like them to be, but as they are, and that process probably will begin for lots of companies now. It is a very long and hard process to do this in a productized form. And one of the reasons people didn't figure this out is, because tech companies don't actually need this because they have one company and/or they have something, but it is not a product. Taking this from one company to a company that can install us anywhere requires a very specialized dedicated product building culture with deep understandings of understanding the enterprise. Last not least, in order to be able to teach large language model to get more exact precise information, you would have to have a secure and clean access to the underlying data of the enterprise. No other company in the world has that kind of access like Palantir, and that's why -- that's why we're completely uniquely positioned to do this. And luckily for the world, we're very long America and we're doing it primarily here, because it's powerful as [Indiscernible]. Ana Soro : Thank you, both. Our next question is from Kamal who asks, how will the new Chinese AI model DeepSeek impact Palantir and how can Palantir mitigate its impact? Shyam Sankar : Well, I think one of the obvious lessons of DeepSeekR1 is something that we've been saying for the last two years, which is that the models are commoditizing. Yes, they're getting better across both closed and open, but they're also getting more similar and the price of inference is dropping like a rock. But I think the real lesson, the more profound one is that we are at war with China. We are in an AI arms race. And I got into a disagreement with Sam Altman about this at the Senate AI Summit over a year ago, where I was arguing that we are in an AI arms race and there's an opposing view that we can all get along and we can cooperate on these things, and I'm sure the other side feels quite different realizing that their IP has been stolen in this process here. But this war started long ago, it is an economic war with the ascension of China to the World Trade Organization, the greatest IP theft in history, the greatest wealth transfer in history, it is an opium war. The number one cause of deaths of 18 to 45-year-olds in this country is fentanyl. That is coming from China. It is a diplomatic war. The Belt and Road initiative is basically indentured servitude for other countries to the CCP here. And the unprecedented Phase Zero Gray Zone operations of the CCP, how many times are we going to believe that anchors are dragged across the sea that cut undersea cables here? But I think one of the things, China knows they're at war, the question is we kind of equivocate on it as a peace-loving nation. But one of the things I want to make sure we all do realize is that the engineering in R1 is exquisite. The optimizations that they've done are really impressive. And I don't think you can get away with the facile explanation that the Chinese just copy and we're the only innovators, we have to wake up with the respect for our adversary and realize that we are competing, but they absolutely did steal a lot of that through distillation of the models and perhaps they stole even more. And then you can look at the GPU sales growth in Singapore. It's a tiny island nation. I'm pretty sure there's some sanction invasion going on there, and we have to realize that the AI race is winner-take-all and it's going to be a whole of nation effort that extends well beyond the DoD in order for us as a nation to win, and that M day was yesterday, the time to mobilize has come. Ana Soro : Thank you, Shyam. Our next question is from Dan with Wedbush. Dan, please turn on your camera and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Daniel Ives : Thank you. [Technical Difficulty] talk about, are you surprised at all? Shyam Sankar : Can you repeat the question? We didn't hear you. Thank you. Daniel Ives : Yes. Are you surprised at how quick these sales cycles are actually taking place from when a customer first meets Palantir to now deploying AI initiatives? I mean, does that surprise the team at all? Ryan Taylor : I would say I'm not surprised because of the energy we feel on the ground in talking to customers and the impact. You know, Shyam, shared some examples taking a back office process from the largest banks from five days to under three minutes, taking what used to automating a process for an automotive supplier from what used to take 100 hours to be automated with just a human check and seeing the reactions of those customers when those are implemented and seeing the impact and seeing them wanting to move quickly, seeing them wanting to start quickly, expand quickly, and essentially stay ahead of their competitors like feeling that energy and feeling that reaction on the ground, I'm not surprised because you feel it, it's tangible. Alex Karp : What surprises me a lot is just, customers and especially countries are just reacting completely differently. So in broad swaths, American companies have approached this revolution in a very pragmatic way, which is, so we had all these experts saying that what you ought to do is buy a large language model and install it on your enterprise, and customers are like, great, we'll try that, but we're also going to try Palantir, and there's really no ideology in this -- in aggregate in this country defining how people do things, it's about output, how quick is that output, what is? And there are just -- there's a lot of communication between enterprises in America, especially in sectors. So people talk about what's working and what's not working. And in contradistinction, if you look at Europe with 13% of our business and 4% growth rate last year. So compare that, it's like more than 10 times better in America in U.S. Comm, right? And what's really happening there is people are reading literally basically PowerPoints of how you did tech installations in the 50s and that's what they're doing. And what is jarring to me is that you just see adoption, radical adoption, from some clients. Again, you do have some people in America who are still doing science projects, but it's -- how could it be that one set of companies in one geography adopts and in a very culturally similar geography, people are just like, okay, great, but that's not how we do it. And so it's -- and this, by the way, is not just we talk a lot about U.S. Commercial because we can't really talk in detail what's happening on the battlefield. But the battlefield -- you know, Shyam could talk about this basically forever that this is basically we enjoy, it's equally divergent. It's like you have cultures that are like we have to fight in a way that suits our culture, that suits our ethics, where we have a primacy of winning and a primacy of maintaining our values, and those cultures are rebuilding how they fight, rebuilding the things that they think are valuable, looking at the evidence of what worked, what didn't, what was the cost structure. And meanwhile, there's just a lot of people who are just like, yeah, but that could get away in the way of vacation. And so it is really, really jarring. I think one of the things I am sympathetic with when investors look at Palantir is like, yes, but it's very hard to know because people are going on different paths, but yes, in America in aggregate, the response is, I expected this to work in X amount of time, you got it to work and beat what I was expecting in 110th, 120th, 150th of the time. And by the way, the other thing that is super surprising is, two, three years ago, when we were doing foundry or even some of our kind of more sensitive things in the military, I believe we were delivering results that were in six months would have taken 10-years and they were things that people couldn't do, but now because of the time and the power, you can't really hide it as easily in some department of your enterprise. So what would happen to us in the past is we would do a -- we do an enterprise thing and because obviously people didn't appreciate our -- my charm and there were no steak dinners and we weren't laughing at your jokes and we were probably saying the wrong things at the wrong times, that thing got stuck in some part of the enterprise. Everyone knew is the most important thing about the enterprise, but no one would acknowledge it. And now it's just too powerful. People are like, yes, yes, don't particularly like them. They don't have to dinners, they don't wear suits, charms, hard to understand for me, but the results are massive and that's what's driving the results in the -- that's what's driving the 54 number that we're guiding that we did last year and we're guiding to this year in U.S. Commercial, that's what's driving the beat. That's what's driving our ability to really maintain our culture. By the way, it's also the Rule of 81 really comes from this reaction to our company, but also because we can stick to our culture, our ontology of Palantir. We do not need 500 extra people a quarter. We just -- we can really power these things because the pull when people actually see it is enough to breakdown the institutional barriers, the political [Indiscernible] that often we were not able to break through in the past. Ana Soro : Thank you. Our next question is from Mariana with Bank of America. Mariana, please turn on your camera and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Mariana Perez Mora : Good afternoon, everyone. So my first question is about disruption. Volunteer has been like actually thriving when there is disruption from the very beginnings of the company, 9/11, Coronavirus, supply chains, LLMs, now everyone is really concerned about Dodge with the change of administration, I could imagine like, focus on efficiencies, focus on software modernization, digitalization could actually be a really good opportunity for you. I don't know if you can deep dive on like how is Palantir positioned to that? And my second question probably to Dave, but like I know Shyam as well, when you see this demand, where do you invest to make sure that you are prepared to actually execute on it? Like is it talent, is it sales? Is it engineers? Is it partnerships? Like what do you do to make sure that you can actually capture this opportunity? Shyam Sankar : Thank you. Well, on the first question here, I mean, I think no one really knows, but -- and we sense a huge amount of fear amongst the traditional system integrators and providers here, the traditional providers of the monopsony, but we're pretty optimistic. And I think if you look at my comments over the past, even my recent Senate Armed Service testimony last week, Palantir's real competition is a lack of accountability in government. These forever software projects that cost an insane amount that don't actually deliver results, they're sacred cows of the deep state. You can think about D6A, it cost billions of dollars and it didn't work. Soldiers and -- Soldiers in war zones preferred Palantir because it worked and it happened to only cost millions of dollars. And I think Dodge is going to bring meritocracy and transparency to government and that's exactly what our commercial business is. The commercial market is meritocratic and transparent and you see the results that we have in that sort of environment and that's the basis of our optimism around this. I think the work that we've done in government, it's deeply operational, it's deeply valuable, and we're pretty excited about exceptional engineers getting in there under the hood and being able to see that for a change. Alex Karp : We love disruption and whatever is good for America will be good for Americans and very good for Palantir. And I think you got it exactly right. Disruption at the end of the day exposes things that aren't working, there'll be ups and down. There's a revolution. Some people get their heads cut off, like -- it's like we're expecting to see really unexpected things and to win basically, that's what we're going to do. See unexpected things, report expected things, and win. And we're planning to do that, and we're pretty optimistic about the U.S. environment. Dave Glazer : And on the investing front, it's like it is quality engineering, right? It's quality engineers and you can see it sort of how we set up our comp programs, sort of -- and obviously, that does mean headcount is going to grow somewhat, but really it is a quality engineers more than -- more than the quantity and you'll continue to see us do that this year. We did it last year, particularly in the back half and you're seeing it sort of in the numbers in Q1 and beyond. Shyam Sankar : Yes, you also, by the way, for the first time, people want to partner with us. There used to be partnership meetings were complete waste of time in BS, like largely so people could fill out a report that they met with us kind of thing, you know, like high-school dating for nerds. I met with them, perfect, I'm not going out with them. That was our experience with partnerships now. Like in the last -- even the last couple of weeks, I've had real partnership discussions because a lot of these people own verticals have to deliver. They're under a lot of pressure and people know how good our products are. And last not least, what we're really investing in my view is, we have a truly unique culture, I visit with companies every week. I've been doing it for 20-years. I've never seen a company or a culture anything like ours. And that's what we have to fight to keep. And every single Palantirian is special, everyone here is doing something unique, we need to continue to attract and retain people who are different, think differently, are different, and get them focused on the world's most important missions, building products the way we know how to build them and that's our primary investment. It's not actually a question of money, which means that that's how we crush the margins. It's about talent and just building really great things, the things you ought to build, not the things you're supposed to build, and getting them to the front line. Operator : Thank you, all. Alex, as always, we have a lot of individual investors on the line, is there anything you'd like to say before we end the call? Alex Karp : We're doing it. We're doing it and I'm sure you're enjoying this as much as I am. Let's not talk to analysts about the burden of being right, our burdens of investing in ontology, our burdens of actually looking at the math, the burden of reading what the Rule of 40 is, the burden of being honest about what an enterprise software company is or the burden of explaining to your friends that you're really happy. Maybe we should just start talking about, I'm very happy to have you along for the journey and you are partners for us. Every Palantirian, we are crushing it. Everyone else is listening. We are dedicating our company. We have dedicated our company to the service of the West and the United States of America and we're super proud of the role we play, especially in places we can't talk about. And we love our success in the U.S. and globally. Also, we are doing in United Kingdom and many other places, Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions, we partner with the very best in the world and when it's necessary to scare enemies and on occasion kill them. And we hope you're in favor of that. We hope you're enjoying being a partner, and we're really happy and very, very focused on what we're doing. Thank you for your time. Ana Soro : Thank you. That concludes Q&A for today's call.",
