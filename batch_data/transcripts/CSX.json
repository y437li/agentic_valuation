Baird Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities David Vernon - Bernstein Walter Spracklin - RBC Justin Long - Stephens Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the CSX Corporation\u2019s First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations for CSX Corporation. You may begin, sir. David Baggs : Thank you and good morning everyone. And welcome again to CSX Corporation\u2019s first quarter 2014 earnings presentation. Presentation material that we\u2019ll be reviewing this morning along with our quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at csx.com under the Investors section. In addition, following the presentation, a webcast and podcast replay will be available on that same website. Here representing CSX this morning are Michael Ward, the company\u2019s Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Clarence Gooden, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; Oscar Munoz, Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, Chief Financial Officer. Now, before we begin the formal part of our program, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company\u2019s disclosure in the accompanying presentation on slide 2. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, let me also remind everyone that at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. That said, with nearly 30 analysts covering CSX today, I would ask, as a courtesy for everyone, to please limit your inquiries to one primary and one follow-up question. And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation\u2019s Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael? Michael Ward : Thank you, David and good morning everyone. Last evening, CSX reported first quarter earnings per share of $0.40, down from $0.45 in the same period last year. These results reflect the challenging winter conditions faced by CSX and the broader transportation industry this quarter. In that regard, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the talented and dedicated men and women of CSX who worked tirelessly to one of the worst winters on record to keep the network running as fluently as possible. I would also like to thank our customers for their patience and support as we work through the service impacts to meet their needs. Looking at the quarterly results, revenue increased 2% to $3 billion on a 3% volume increase. The underlying economy remained strong supports continued gain in CSX\u2019s intermodal and merchandise markets, which more than offset the decline in coal business. At the same time, as Oscar will discuss in more detail later, we took many steps during the quarter to keep service levels as high as possible in a challenging environment. Dealing with these challenges also had the effect of increasing costs. As a result, operating income decreased 16% to $739 million and the operating ratio increased 520 basis points to 75.5%. As we look forward, we have the resources in place to support a gradual service recovery while also capitalizing on the market opportunities created by broad economic strength. We see the first quarter headwinds transitioning to longer-term positive momentum in the back half of the year as the economy drives additional growth in our merchandise and intermodal business coupled with an improving environment for domestic coal this year based on increased electrical demand, higher natural gas prices and reduced stockpiles across much of CSX\u2019s service territory. Given these opportunities, we will more than offset the challenges of this quarter. For that reason, our earnings fit to remain intact with modest growth expected for full year 2014. Now I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Clarence, who will take us through the topline results in more detail. Clarence? Clarence Gooden : Thank you, Michael and good morning. This was a challenging quarter with the impact of the severe winter masking the underlying strength of the economy and the strong demand for our service. As you can see on the left side of the chart, total volume grew 3% and surpassed 1.6 million loads in the quarter with growth in merchandise and intermodal more than offsetting the decline in coal. As a result, merchandise and intermodal now combine for 82% of CSX\u2019s total volume. Moving to the right, total revenue increased $49 million to over $3 billion in the quarter, reflecting overall volume growth and increased pricing across most markets. Here merchandise and intermodal now account for over three quarters of CSX\u2019s overall revenue. Next the average, revenue per unit was down slightly, the impact of core pricing gains and liquidated damages was offset by the unfavorable mix impact related to growth in intermodal versus the decline in coal. Finally, coal pricing on a same-store sale basis remains solid across nearly all markets. Recall that same-store sales are defined as shipments with the same customer, commodity, and car type, and the same origin and destination. These shipments represented 75% of CSX\u2019s traffic base for the quarter. On this basis, all-in prices was 0.5% in the quarter, primarily reflecting continued rate pressure in the export coal market. Since we continued to have greater variability in both our export and domestic coal business reflecting global market conditions and our fixed variable contract structure and since our merchandise and intermodal markets are becoming a larger portion of our business, we have again provided you with the same-store sales pricing for these two markets on a combined basis. At the bottom of this panel, you can see pricing for merchandise and intermodal averaged 2.6% for the quarter. This increase is less on a year-over-year basis, but still represents a solid spread over rail inflation. That said, we remain confident that the value created by our service product for our customers provides a solid foundation for growth and pricing above rail inflation over the long-term. Now let\u2019s look at the individual markets in more detail, starting with merchandise. Overall, merchandise revenue increased 4% to nearly $1.8 billion in the quarter. Volume in the agricultural sector was up 4%. Feed grain shipments, both domestic and export, increased sharply due to a strong 2013 harvest. In addition, ethanol shipments grew as lower corn prices resulted in higher ethanol production levels. The construction sector declined 2% overall as weather-related challenges more than offset the continued recovery of the residential housing market. Finally, the industrial sector was up 3%, strength in energy-related commodities including crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas more than offset lower shipments in the metals and automotive markets impacted by the severe winter weather. Moving to the next slide, let\u2019s review the intermodal business. Intermodal revenue increased 4% to $421 million. Total intermodal volume grew 5%, setting a new first quarter record. Domestic volume was up 7% also setting a new first quarter record driven by continued highway to rail conversions. International volume was up 3% year-over-year reflecting continued economic growth. Total intermodal revenue per unit declined 1% as continued core pricing gains and higher fuel recoveries were offset by unfavorable mix. Volume associated with our domestic door-to-door product, which has higher revenue per unit was more severely impacted by the weather. Finally, we continued to focus on the intermodal product by adding new service offering and making strategic investments. These investments include the new terminal in Winter Haven, Florida, which opened early this month; the Montreal terminal, which will open later in the year and the ongoing expansion of the Northwest Ohio facility. Moving to the next slide, let\u2019s review the coal business. Coal revenue declined 9% in the quarter to $662 million. Export coal tonnage declined 15% as global market conditions for both thermal and metallurgical coals continued to soften. The API2 benchmark for thermal coal recently fell to $75 per ton, a level where U.S. coals were more challenged to compete. The Queensland metallurgical coal benchmark has also fallen to low levels of $120 per ton. Domestic coal tonnage increased 8% driven by increased northern utility shipments including a competitive gain. Finally, total revenue per unit was down 8% with lower export pricing and unfavorable domestic mix negatively impacting RPU. Moving on to the next slide, let\u2019s take a look at the macroeconomic environment. The underlying macro economy remains constructive for growth. The purchasing managers\u2019 index increased to 53.7% in March. Rating above 50 indicates the manufacturing economy is expanding. This is the 10th consecutive month that PMI index has signaled expansion. Meanwhile, the customer inventories index declined to 42 in March. Rating below 50 indicates customer\u2019s inventories are low. This is the lowest ratings since May of 2011 when the customers\u2019 inventory index registered 39.5. On the right side of the page, both the GDP and IDP projections remain strong and show continued growth throughout 2014. This is consistent with what we see in the marketplace and what we hear from our diverse customer base. Now let me wrap up with the outlook for the second quarter. Looking forward, we expect the overall volume outlook for the second quarter to be positive with favorable conditions for 83% of our markets and stable conditions for the remaining 17%. Looking at some of the key markets, agriculture is favorable with higher year-over-year crop yields supporting continued growth in grain shipments. We expect growth in chemicals as we continue to capture opportunities created by the expanding domestic oil and gas industry. The continued expansion of the U.S. housing and construction markets will drive growth in the forest products and mineral markets. Strong intermodal growth will continue as our strategic network investments and service reliability support highway to rail conversions. We expect domestic coal volume will grow in the second quarter as inventory levels have normalized and gas prices have increased to levels where most coals are more competitive fuel source. Export coal volume is expected to be neutral in the second quarter and our best estimate of 2014 volume remains in the mid 30 million ton range, reflecting soft global market conditions particularly in the thermal market. At the same time, rail pricing will likely continue to reflect the weak global market conditions. The automotive market is stable with North American light vehicle production expected to grow 1% in the second quarter. The U.S. economic expansion is expected to continue in 2014 with projected GDP and IDP growth of 2.9% and 3.2% respectively, producing a macroeconomic environment that supports growth. The value of the service we provide supports not only growth, but also pricing above rail inflation over the long-term. Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Oscar to review our operating results. Oscar Munoz : Thank you, Clarence and good morning everyone. Well, as most of you know or heard by now, this past winter season was one of near historical portions in terms of the duration, the coal, the snow and ice and the corresponding impact on not only rail, but truck and airline transportation systems, their supply chain and frankly the overall economy was pretty significant. We at CSX certainly felt the impact of the severe weather and despite the best efforts of our operating employees, lost and worked around the clock to ensure we were able to deliver freight even in the worst of conditions. CSX\u2019s operating performance this quarter was not at the high levels we\u2019ve all come to expect. We assure you that the team is fully engaged to support both the gradual recovery and the strong demand that Clarence just discussed. Now looking at the operating results in the first quarter and beginning with safety. While CSX still remains a leader amongst the class one railroads, we did experience an increase in both personal injuries and in train accidents. The personal injury rate was up to 0.6 and the train accident rate rose to 2.35, both up from near record low levels in the first quarter of last year. Adverse operating conditions were a factor of these results, but we remained focused on prevention with the specific emphasis on avoiding catastrophic injuries. Let me now turn to the company\u2019s service performance on the next slide. Our operating measures echo the challenges of the North American transportations we faced in the first quarter; originations, arrivals, velocity and dwell are all well off the record levels over the last two years. But as you\u2019ll see later on in the presentation, service measures are stabilizing and beginning to improve. Turning to slide 15, I will highlight some of the specific challenges we faced from the severe weather in the quarter. While the impact of CSX network was most keenly felt in the Midwest and Northeast, which is a network business and as you can see on the map on the left of the chart on-time originations were negatively impacted as far as South as the State of Georgia. Of course our Northern region clearly faced the worst of the storms, resulting an on-time performance for the quarter of just above 50%. On the right side of the chart you can see heating degree day, an indicator of the severity of cold temperatures were up over 17% on a year-over-year basis. And snowfall was more than doubled prior year levels in most of our Northern service territory. Now in a normal winter, when a storm approaches, we make adjustments to the operating plant, move development resources to the area to accommodate the disruption and then usually have a little time to return to normal operating plans after the weather has passed. This year 25 storms came back to back over several months, which means the operating plant have to be constantly adjusted to serve customer needs. These adjustments require more resources and can also stress our line of road and [yard] capacity. Now as the worse of the weather seems to be behind us and we are beginning to see fluidity recover, however given the duration of the storm season and the backlog of freight it created along with the increased demand we are seeing, our complete service recovery will be gradual. Now let me turn to next slide and I will discuss the effects on the operating costs of business. Now while Fredric will provide more specifics on where these impacts were in the quarter and what to expect going forward, let me give you some details on key operational impact. If you look at the chart and on the left, the number of relief starts doubled year-over-year and overtime across the entire operating department was up nearly 50%. Reposition maintenance of the way and signal employees around the clock along our critical routes to ensure traffic can move safely and efficiently through these effective areas. Mechanical employees worked extra shifts to ensure locomotives and freight cars were available to help catch up and meet customer demand. In the transportation department labor to ensure terminals remain fluid and trains ran as close to schedule as possible. Moving down the chart, average freight car cycle days were up 9% reflecting the additional time it took to move cars to and from customer facilities. We also placed additional locomotives into service; the result was a 7% increase in the average locomotive count. With this many additional locomotives and the harsh conditions, fuel efficiency was impacted. I am encouraged however that we only saw 2% set back in this measure as the underlying technology and processes we have in place to drive fuel savings are still yielding results. Finally our active T&E Crew was flat on a year-over-year basis. Crews worked extra hard to run the network through this harsh winter and I am pleased to say that crew availability remains high and the team was able to support solid volume growth even through the operating challenges. To recapping maintaining network fluidity in these extreme conditions drove a significant short-term cost impact what was necessary to serve our customers. Now let me turn to slide 17 and discuss our recent service trends. CSX is stabilized and is beginning to recover. A last of the significant storm systems came through about a month ago and as you see depicted on the chart on the left of the slide on-time originations is trending up and dwell is declining since that time, while with positive signs. As Clarence reviewed, traffic levels are also increasing. In support of this growth, we expect our current high level of locomotives to remain in service for the foreseeable future and we have new crew members in training to meet this rising demand. The recovery in Chicago specifically will likely take longer to meet the amount of interchange traffic with other railroads and the complexity of the rail network there. Nevertheless the rails are in close coordination and we\u2019re beginning to see some [headways]. As we look forward, we remain confident in our progress. So, it is clear the recovery and related additional costs will extend through the second quarter with more meaningful improvement in the second half of the year. Now let me wrap up on the last slide. As I discussed the effects from the winter storms were wide and significant driving an increase in cost and impacting service levels. Nevertheless, CSX is confident in the ability of this operating team to steadily return service to the levels our customers have come to expect. We\u2019re adequately resourced recovery and our operating measures are headed in the right direction. On a productivity perspective, while it\u2019s too early to give you an update, estimate for the full year, it\u2019s pretty clear we\u2019re not going to be able to deliver our normal $130 million savings, but we\u2019ll update you on that later on in the year. So, at this point, let me echo Michael\u2019s comments and thank each of our employees for the skill and dedication and safely and efficiently serving our customers through this challenging winter. With that let me now turn the presentation over to Fred to review the financial. Fredrik Eliasson :  Thank you Oscar and good morning everyone. As Clarence mentioned earlier, revenue increased 2% in the first quarter as declines in coal revenue were more than offset by gains in merchandise, intermodal and other revenue. In the quarter, other revenue included $55 million of liquidated damages, an increase of $22 million versus the prior year. Looking at the remainder of 2014, we expect liquidity damages to be about $10 million for each of the remaining quarters. Expenses increased 9% versus last year driven primarily by the adverse impact of winter weather that Oscar mentioned and the cycling of real estate gains, both of which I will discuss in more detail in the coming slides. Operating income was $739 million, down 16% or $141 million versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense was down $7 million versus last year driven by favorable interest rates on debt that was refinanced in 2013 and modestly lower debt levels. Other income was $7 million and income taxes were $208 million in the quarter for an effective tax rate of approximately 34%. This included the stated legislative tax change, which benefited earnings by $0.02 per share. Without this change, the effective tax rate would have been 37.6%. Overall, net earnings were $398 million and EPS was $0.40 per share, down from $462 million and $0.45 respectively from the prior year period. Now before we move on, let me take a moment to summarize the total impact that weather had on our first quarter financial results. We estimate that weather impact on the first quarter expense was around $90 million or $0.06 per share. Revenue impact is more challenging to quantify, but we estimate there was about $0.02 to $0.03 per share in revenue contribution that we were not able to recover in the first quarter due to weather disruptions. With that let\u2019s turn to the next slide and briefly discuss how fuel lag impacted the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the effect of the lag in our fuel surcharge program was $4 million unfavorable. This reflects $9 million of negative in-quarter lag during the first quarter of 2014 versus $5 million of negative in-quarter lag for the same period in the prior year. Based on the current forward curve, we expect the year-over-year fuel lag impact to be negative in the second quarter, similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Turning to the next slide, let\u2019s review our expenses. Overall expenses increased 9% in the quarter. I will talk about the top three expense items in more detail on the next slide, but let me first briefly speak to the bottom two on this chart. Depreciation was up 5% to $283 million due to the increase in the net asset base. Going forward, we expect depreciation to increase sequentially a few million dollars per quarter, reflecting the ongoing investments in our business. Equipment rent was up 6% to $101 million due to the weather\u2019s impact on the network and higher locomotive lease expense as active fleet was increased to minimize service disruption. Now turning to the next slide, let's discuss our other expenses. First, let me highlight the impacts that we have attributed to weather disruption across each of these expense categories. As I previously mentioned, we estimated first quarter weather impact on expense was $90 million. Of that, $35 million is attributable to labor and fringe driven primarily by overtime and relief crew starts. $35 million in MS&O due to an increase in active locomotives and higher utility expense, $15 million is in fuel driven by loss of efficiency and an increase in non-locomotive heating fuel. And finally, there was $5 million of weather impact in equipment and rent expense, which I covered on the previous slide. Looking ahead at the second quarter, we expect to incur additional cost associated with recovering from the weather disruptions, although not to the same degree as seen in the first quarter. That summarizes the weather impact on our first quarter expenses. Now let me discuss the other drivers for each of expense categories, beginning on the left with labor and fringe. Total labor and fringe increased 6% to $47 million versus last year and included $14 million of inflation. Going forward, we expect labor inflation to be around $15 million on a year-over-year basis for the remaining quarters in 2014. At the same time, we expect headcount to remain roughly flat to our first quarter level, although as we have consistently demonstrated we will continue to adjust resources to reflect current volume levels and drive efficiency. Moving to the right on the slide, MS&O expense increased 24% or $122 million versus last year. This included a cycling of $49 million of real estate gain, a $12 million increase in expenses related to train accidents and $9 million of inflation. In addition, there was $17 million increase in other MS&O, [setting] multiple items none of which were significantly by themselves. Looking ahead, MS&O expense will continue to be impacted by this cycling of real estate gains, which as a reminder totaled $36 million in the second quarter of 2013. However, there are no further gains to be cycled in the second half. In addition, we continue to expect high year-over-year expenses in the remaining quarters related to inflation and volume growth. Finally, fuel expense was essentially flat to last year as favorable price driven by a 5% decline in our fuel cost per gallon was offset by volume and weather headwinds. That concludes the expense review for the first quarter. Turning to the next slide, I am pleased to announce that we\u2019ll be increasing our dividend. CSX will pay a dividend of $0.16 per share starting in the second quarter, which reflects the 7% increase versus the prior year. While this results in a dividend payout ratio slightly above our target range of 30% to 35%, it is important to note that weather-related headwinds we experienced in the first quarter are not indicative of the core earnings power of the business. We expect our full year EPS to better reflect the [true] earnings power and to support a 30% to 35% dividend payout range in 2014. Our second quarter dividend increased builds on the 11 increases we have made over the last 8 years representing a 20% CAGR in a dividend over that period. Now let me wrap it up on the next slide. First, the core earnings power of our business remains strong. Despite the very challenging operating conditions that we faced, we delivered top-line revenue growth of 2% and grew volume by 3% in this first quarter. Across the portfolio, we generally have a positive outlook on the growth trajectory for our merchandise and intermodal market. In addition, we expect 2013 was the low point for domestic coal and that volume will grow this year, whereas the export coal market continues to be volatile. Our near-term focus is to restore superior service levels across the network as quickly as possible. We experienced significant incremental operating expense in the first quarter from weather disruptions and expect some of these costs to continue into the second quarter. While we plan to recover a portion of this loss productivity during the remainder of the year, our first priority is to restore higher service levels. For the full year 2014, we expect to see modest earnings growth despite first half headwinds from weather and the cycling of real estate gains. We have visibility to 7 million new tons of utility coal as a result of the cold winter and higher natural gas prices, which will more than offset the incremental cost incurred in the first quarter. Looking at 2015, it is still not clear whether projected 2015 growth rate will be strong enough to deliver 2 year EPS CAGR of 10% to 50% across 2014 and 2015 given the modest growth expectations we have for this year. That said we feel confident that CSX can sustain double-digit EPS growth as we get through this year. That earnings growth which will be more balanced between volume, price and efficiency will also contribute to an improving operating ratio which we expect to be in the mid 60s longer term. With that let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks. Michael Ward :  Thank you, Fredrik. As you\u2019ve heard this morning this first quarter was certainly more challenging than most. And again I thank our employees and customers for their perseverance and patience over these past few months. As I look ahead, we have the right people and resources in place. And we\u2019re working hard to return our network to the high levels of service and reliability that we have consistently produced for our customers while remaining a leader in one of the nation\u2019s safest industries. With that as a foundation, I\u2019m confident in the company\u2019s ability to deliver modest growth for the full year 2014 and become more effective serving broad markets that will put the company in a position to sustain positive earnings momentum over the long haul. In that regard, we are particularly optimistic about the opportunities and plans to support increases in the intermodal and merchandise markets. Put another way, the underlying strength of our network and team coupled with a more stable domestic coal environment and a growing economy gives us confidence that in 2015 and beyond, CSX should again sustain margin expansion and double-digits earning growth. With that, we\u2019re pleased to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Your may ask your questions. Michael Ward : Good morning Bill. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Yes. Hi, good morning. Fredrik, can I ask you for a little bit of clarification on your guidance commentary, particularly as it relates to \u201815, because I think most of us recognize there are some extraordinary events so far this year. And so there is not -- we don\u2019t have the same kind of expectations for this year. But in \u201815, when you think about that double-digit growth rate, what kind of gives you confidence in it? Can you kind of maybe walk us through a little bit of the assumptions behind it maybe, because obviously there are still concerns about how long export coal could be weak and these sorts of things. So I think it would be helpful to know kind of what goes into that comment? Fredrik Eliasson : Sure. So, just take a different year, so first of all, we said modest earnings growth for 2014. And while we feel strong and have good confidence in what we see for 2015 as the year by itself, we\u2019re pretty bullish about the macro factors that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re pretty bullish about the fact as we get the network running better again, but 2015 by itself will be very strong year. The question is, will it be strong enough to make up for the fact that we\u2019re only making modest gains this year. And that\u2019s left to be seen. Clearly the domestic market on the coal side has gone stronger over the last few months. But at the same time, we continue to see the export coal market deteriorate. So it\u2019s a little hard at this point to be too bullish about that part of the market. And so, instead of getting into individual component, what I have said throughout the quarter has been, so I am overseeing things right now for 2015, we are going to need some help as we think about this thing from a bottoms up perspective. And that help in coming different forms are going to come in terms of export market firming up, a little bit more domestic coal, little bit better pricing, more productivity, we just don\u2019t know. But overall 2015 by itself would be very strong year and it\u2019s just not sure it\u2019s going to be as strong enough to make up for the modest earnings growth we are seeing here in 2014. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Yes. One point of clarification there, another comment you have made in the past I think on \u201815 has been sub-70 OR so a high 60s OR in 2015, are you walking away from that? Fredrik Eliasson :  I think the same thing holds true there in order to get to that sub 70 offering ratio, we are going to also need some help from where we are seeing things today. It doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t get there, we certainly going to -- we certainly target it, we are trying to get there but we are going to need some help from where we are seeing things today. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Does the change to fix variable cost do anything to pricing there, if the domestic coal comes back, does this make pricing sort of weaker and does that effect of you? Fredrik Eliasson :  It doesn\u2019t really impact the overall trajectory. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Okay, alright. Thank you for the time. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Michael Ward :  Good morning, Ken. Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch :  Good morning. Michael, you mentioned a couple of times that you are prepared for a gradual recovery, Oscar mentioned a little bit about maybe not hitting the $130 million recovery this year because some costs are coming in. What if we -- I mean we have seen volumes already up 11% quarter-to-date, what if we get a little bit of a sharper recovery in terms of volumes, what does that do in order to flex the network and stress test, what your infrastructure is? Oscar Munoz :  Ken, so that was a couple of questions, specifically your -- restate your question a little bit if you could? Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch :  I am just wondering because you mentioned, Michael mentioned a couple of times and I think as did you in terms of a gradual recovery you are prepared for that. What if we see, I mean you have already seen volumes up 11% starting off second quarter pretty robust, what -- how are you prepared if the recovery is a little bit stronger than that? Does that mean you\u2019re fearful that if we get too much volume, it\u2019s going to stress the network too much and you would be prepared just because you mentioned the word gradual recovery so many times? Oscar Munoz : Yes. Thank you, Ken. I appreciate that. So, the gradual recovery is based upon exactly the volume that we are seeing, so both backlog as well as the increased demand and again, our balance between productivity and ensuring superior service levels. And so we\u2019re making sure that everyone understands that we -- our balance is geared towards our customer. And the volume that we\u2019re seeing today is if you think of our sort of annual peak periods weeks 9 through week 23 is kind of at the peak of it. So right now we\u2019re probably in the highest point of workload we\u2019re going to have in the course of the year and we\u2019re slightly improving. So we feel pretty confident around that. Now given that fact we\u2019re bringing on some more locomotives, we continue to bring crews out of training and of course doing the hiring if required. But now the volume is a very welcome event for us after a couple of years of being in relatively dry. Michael Ward : Ken, it is Michael. The other thing I\u2019d add to that is obviously with that demand which I think we\u2019re doing a reasonable job of handling, it does slow your ability to recover. And I think the other thing I would point out, the Chicago as you know is a key interchange. And I think all the major carriers have issues around Chicago and those will take time to work through. And it does have a cascading impact on the rest of the network. So, we will continue to improve. I think the reason we used gradual several times, because we don\u2019t think this is going to snap back immediately and that\u2019s [to] try to make people understand that. Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch : But I guess if we see a little bit stronger, is that something that you need to then reengage that, the one plan from years ago, is it evolutionary? I am just trying to understand is that something that could make this look even a worse if you get a little bit faster growth? Michael Ward :  Well, we used our reengaging one plan, we still use the one plan to run our railroad, but I\u2019m not overly concerned. I think the demand levels we\u2019re seeing out there we can handle, we will work through. So I don\u2019t see that as a major risk. I think it really adds more like as Oscar said, it\u2019s an opportunity for us to help regain some of that lost earnings in the first quarter. Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch :  Wonderful and then just a follow-up on kind of Bill\u2019s question there on the coal RPU. If you exclude the liquidated damages, how should we think about coal yields for the rest of the year? Fred, is that something we\u2019re going to see accelerate on the declines given the change in contract structures or maybe you could just walk us through your thoughts a little bit on that? Clarence Gooden : Ken this is Clarence. I think you will see the coal RPUs will be very similar to what you saw in the first quarter. Our utility north business was up about 22% in the first quarter and that tends to carry a lower RPU; our southern utility was down about 6% in the first quarter and our rates on our export coal as we mentioned were slightly down. So that mix that particular mix will tend to carry through here in the second quarter, so you will see something very similar on the RPU going forward. Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch :  Great, I appreciate the insight and time. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. You may ask your question. Michael Ward :  Good morning Brandon. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays: Yes, good morning everyone. And it\u2019s still snowing in New Jersey by the way, so it\u2019s a pretty tough spring as well. Michael Ward :  Never ending. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays: I just want to ask a longer term question, Michael. I mean coal revenue used to be 30 plus percent of your mix, it\u2019s down to close to 23%, 22% this quarter. We\u2019ve seen your non-coal volume expand 3% to 4% for the last few years. What are some of the impediments that keeps that non-coal growth from driving better operational margins and I know you\u2019ve been talking about the quarter, but just thinking longer term, how do you get that base of revenue to drive better margins and better earnings growth looking forward? Michael Ward : Well, as Fred alluded to one, obviously the coal is a high margin business and our portfolio has changed. But we\u2019re very optimistic, if we look at our intermodal and merchandise growth, it is good margin business. And we think as we go forward, if you look at our value creation we drove in the decade prior to this, it was about two-thirds price and one-third productivity. As we look at the company going forward, we still see strong value creation opportunities that are being more balanced, not exactly a third; a third; a third, but it\u2019s going to be continued productivity, continued pricing above rail inflation and adding the element of growth. The intermodal margins are very nice now that we have basically double stack economics and the density of lanes and the other business we\u2019re growing the crude by rail, the growth in our other merchandise businesses are all good margin businesses that will help drive us to that mid 60s operating ratio long-term. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays: Okay. I mean at what point though, do you need still coal revenue stabilization in order to just overall expand margins for the business; is that what we\u2019re hearing today? Michael Ward : Well, we do need the coal to stabilize and we think we\u2019re getting fairly close to that point now. This cold winter, the early blessing of this cold winter is a big drawdown to the stockpiles. Actually as Clarence alluded to, the demand in the north is very strong and actually the stockpiles are below where they ideally would like to have them. And the overhang we\u2019ve been living within the south for the last couple of years, about three quarters of that was eliminated here. So, we really do see that domestic is very strong\u2026 Oscar Munoz : Yes. Just to add to that that Brandon also, in terms of the underlying core earnings power of our company over the last two years, it\u2019s been pretty strong. I mean we\u2019re still thinking of double-digit earnings range. The issue has been $800 million of coal revenue that has gone away. And in this year we are still seeing some headwinds in coal, which is why we only feel that we are going to have modest earnings growth. But we are pretty confident as I said once we get through this transition that we are going to return to the more normalized earnings growth going forward. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays: Okay, appreciate it guys. Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. You may ask your question. Michael Ward :  Good morning, Chris. Chris Wetherbee - Citi:  Hey, good morning, guys. Clarence, could I just ask for a little bit of clarification on your comments around the export coal market? I think you included it in the neutral category in the outlook. And I just want to get a rough sense of how you think about that relative to the sort of full year target. I think you still said in the mid 30 million ton range. Should we expect a bit of an absolute tonnage step up in the second quarter which I guess would be a little bit more neutral or is that still going to be a little bit under pressure on a year-over-year basis? Clarence Gooden :  Well, it\u2019s a little too soon Chris to sort of see what this export coal business going to do. Frankly it\u2019s a lot stronger this first quarter than I anticipated that it would be. So, we are sticking with sort of mid 30s throughout the year. We have got in the second quarter right now about 80% of what we project for the quarter is tied up under contracts. And that\u2019s obviously subject to market conditions. We think we have hit pretty much the bottom of where the global price of coal is going to be. The thermal is very low right now in Europe; the metallurgical prices are very low over in Queensland right now. So, as we move towards the middle of the year, we expect to see a more firming in the rate structure, and we can tell you a little bit more towards the middle of the year what it looks like. But right now, we are sticking pretty much to the mid 30 ton, mid 30s in the export market. Chris Wetherbee - Citi: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. And then Fred, I think three months ago, you sort of mentioned that the first half of the year when we thought about 2014 was going to be the where you were lapping some of the real-estate gains and other stuff yet in 2013. When you look at the second quarter with the volumes bouncing back with still some cost lingering, is that still the right way to think about the first half is going to sort of be a bit, sort of flat to downish on a year-over-year basis and then maybe you get a little bit of upside, is that sort of how your plan is building as you think about 2014 showing modest growth? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes. I would say that probably flattish is a good way to think about the second quarter. I think we feel very good about the top-line. I think that you have still those things to cycle that you talked about real estate gains based on that what I said earlier liquidated damage probably down a little bit in the second quarter as well. And then we will have some lingering cost there for a period of time because of the fact that our network is not running as well, but offsetting that is a more vibrant top-line especially in the coal side and we expect it. So I think flattish is probably good place in the second quarter and then from there, we have to produce earnings growth for the rest of the year to get into that modest earnings growth for the year. Chris Wetherbee - Citi: Do you think you mostly cut up on volume by the end of the second quarter, is that how the plan would sort of trend? Fredrik Eliasson : I would think that based on what you\u2019ve seen here in the last few weeks where volumes are up double-digit that that would be a good assumption. Chris Wetherbee - Citi: Okay. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning Allison. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So, I wanted to ask the question about core operating margins. And if I am adjusting both this quarter and the prior year for all the unusual items including weather or liquidated damages, real estate gains, the fuel lag et cetera, it doesn\u2019t appear that there was very much operating leverage on the 3% volume growth during the quarter. So, I wanted to ask how we should think about contribution margins for the balance of the year, considering both the rate cuts on the export coal side and the fact that you plan to bring on additional locomotive and people. Fredrik Eliasson :  Yes. So obviously it was a noisy quarter in terms of the ins and outs. But I think you are right, if you do adjust for the real estate gains in both the years, you adjust for the fact that you did have weather impact here, and you will see that you had modest earnings growth year-over-year. And now that\u2019s an even factor in also the fact that we had taken our export rate down quite significantly. So once you adjust for all these things, we as I said in my previous answers, the core earnings growth of our company and margin expansion is still very healthy, we\u2019re just dealing with a lot of factors right now that we have to cycle through. And as we get through this, real estate gains will be behind us here as we get through the second quarter where the tail end I think of what we reasonably can do on the export side; and the rest of the business is doing good; coal on the domestic side is coming back. We feel we\u2019re going to return back to normal incremental margins going forward. But it\u2019s just a lot of noise right now that prevents us from coming down to the bottom line. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse :  Okay. And a follow-up question on the tax rate benefit during the quarter. I did notice that there was a comment in the earnings review that the future corporate tax rate would be reduced. I mean should we expect sort of a similar tax rate as we saw in 1Q or is there any sort of prior period catch up? Fredrik Eliasson :  No, we had a -- this is a state legislative tax change that impacted our earnings by $0.02 here in this quarter that made effective tax rate 34%. If you just ask for that, we were right at 37.6%. So, our guidance has always been somewhere around 38%, that\u2019s very conservative place to be and then we think that we should be the place going forward as well. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Okay. So, I guess in terms of the comment that said that this will reduce the future corporate income tax rate, is that\u2026 Fredrik Eliasson : I don\u2019t know about that comment. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Okay. Fredrik Eliasson : So maybe David will talk about it later, but there is -- nothing has changed in terms of our overall tax and we would like to of course have a lower tax rate. But nothing is imminent around that. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Perfect. Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning Rob. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Fred you had called out about 7 million incremental utility coal counts you guys are going to be taking on that you have got now line of sight into the back half of the year. How should we think about this as we look out to 2015 as well? Does this give you guys conviction that we\u2019re going to see utility coal point that we stabilize to growth as we look out even in spite of some of the, I think the 4 million tons that you\u2019re expecting to go in \u201814 and \u201815 from some plant closures? Fredrik Eliasson : Well, a couple of things there in your question just to clarify. So first of all, we do see several million tons of incremental demand here this year, because of the cold winter. Then I think your question was around 2015 and beyond the impact of map. And what we have said is that as we look at the movement of coal for 2013 into plants that we expect to be close, because of map, we have identified 7 million tons that we think is going to come out between \u201814 through \u201818 essentially. 4 million of those tons we think is going to come out in \u201814 and \u201815 and the remaining 3 million in the years beyond that between \u201816, \u201817 and \u201918. Does that answer your question? Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : That answers that question with regard to the several million tons that are coming out in the back half of the year. Will we have continued -- are you expecting that, do you have line of sight in terms of that traffic looking out \u201815 as well where you have got a lot of conviction that utility coal volumes, how that be stabilized and are growing as we look out over the next several years? Clarence Gooden :  Well Rob, this is Clarence. We expect that our growth in coal continues in through 2015. In fact the growth for the rest of this year in utility coal will be in the mid to the high single digits as a lot of those plants that Fredrik has talked about is that will be closed in those years in terms of tons, the other plants that will remain open will simply run harder to absorb those tonnage. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : Thanks, appreciate the color. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. You may ask your question. Michael Ward :  Good morning. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna: Good morning, guys. One for Clarence here, we\u2019ve talked pretty extensively about export coal pricing pressure over the last couple of years. And you said again today that you kind of [have been] to what you can do to help incentivize your customer\u2019s competitiveness in that market. If my math is right, it looks like that yields have come down a bit on domestic side of business over the last few quarters as well. I know you called out mix earlier but can you directionally kind of walk us through what\u2019s driving that drop in domestic yields between mix and any pricing or fuel that\u2019s in there as well? Clarence Gooden :  Well as I said earlier on the mix side, the [plus point] preponderantly in the mix, the utility coal which carries a much lower rate than those, the northern utility coal which carries a much lower rate than the southern utility coal is up about 22% this year. The southern utility coal which carries a considerably higher rate due to the much longer length of haul was down about 6% then when you put it in the export coal which we said has been slightly down in terms of rates. Those three combinations that put down have led to the lower RPU, very little of that has been driven at all by the fixed variable charges in our coal rates. So, that\u2019s the principle preponderant drive. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna: Okay. And a bit more broadly on the similar theme, you talked about competitive gains helping your domestic coal volumes this quarter. What\u2019s the competitive dynamic like in that business today and has the volatility we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years given you more opportunities to go after your competitors\u2019 business and vice versa than after yours? Clarence Gooden : Not really, it was a single account in the north that the customers put up more competitive bid and involved the one-time issue. So, we really haven\u2019t had many opportunities in that area at all. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna: Is there any way to quantify how much of that is driving your domestic gain which you talked about in the previous question? Clarence Gooden : Very little is driving our domestic gain in that area, most of it has been a result of a burn in the northern utilities and their stockpile depletion. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna: All right. Thanks for the time this morning. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Jeff Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham: Hey, good morning everybody. Thank you very much. I think the point on the weather has been well made. But I have a question concerning some of the noise we\u2019ve been hearing on the regulatory side. And I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re prepared to comment, but there recently were hearings on the competitive switching, they\u2019ve put out some requests for recommendations on the revenue adequacy questions. How do you view the regulatory environment right now? And what are your thoughts out there on some of the discussions? Michael Ward : Yes Jeff, this is Michael. So, on the export of 7/11 which is the [met leave] proposal as you\u2019re well aware, we did testify at the March 26th hearing opposing that proposal, because it basically provides no public benefit at all. The early possible beneficiaries -- and you may recall there is a study commissioned by the STB a number of years ago by the Christensen Group is that very few shippers would benefit to the detriment of everyone else and we think that\u2019s still true. It would degrade service, it would introduce uncertainty in the marketplace, disrupt our plans for growth and capital investments, strain prior investments. And if you think about it, our witness Cressey Brown that day at the hearing did say that you could introduce a perpetual winter like we\u2019ve just seen because you\u2019ve been putting unnatural moves in there. So, we\u2019re hopeful that the STB in its wisdom will not do anything to disrupt what is working quite well today for our customers. On the side of the revenue adequacy piece, we actually welcome that examination. As you know, that\u2019s an issue that\u2019s I think right for examination in that, no time of the past [leveraging] but anywhere close to revenue adequacy. Some of us are approaching that, but those issues around what is sustained revenue adequacy, how many years do you have to be doing it through a business cycle, what is the appropriate criteria. And we really welcomed that examination to try to bring better clarity to what will happen as the railroads continue to grow in their financial health. And you\u2019d like to bring a question of replacement cost into that equation, because we do have to replace old assets with new dower. So, we think that\u2019s really right one and we\u2019re glad that they call for it. Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham: Okay. Well, thank you very much and congratulations. Michael Ward : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning Scott. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Just want to clarify one think Clarence, did you guys have to take the export rates down further in 2Q as the new benchmark kicked in? Clarence Gooden : Scott we did in a couple of lines with a couple of customers to make them competitive, yes. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : Okay. On the intermodal side so nice volume growth, but still some pressure on the yields and wondering if that's a pricing thing, is that mix. I wouldn\u2019t think it's mix just with domestic growing faster than international, but maybe it's mix. And then with the truckload pricing that's really starting to get better, should we start to think about your intermodal pricing getting better going forward? Clarence Gooden : Two answers, it was definitely and specifically weather related, it was definitely a mix, it was in our door-to-door product, it had almost 2.5% impact, it was in the spot market where we couldn't price because of the weather-related issues this quarter. The other pricing, the other areas was positive. Yes, we are seeing a firming in the spot market with truck capacity tightening up in the U.S. in just about every regional area that we serve. So, you are seeing a more firming in the truck pricing. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : Okay, great. And then just last thing maybe for Oscar or Michael, you guys have done such a great job taking resources out of the network following \u201808, \u201809 after a winter like this and maybe with volumes getting better. Are there longer term implications or do you need to spend more capital or bring back on a more sustainable basis more people or equipment? Oscar Munoz : Yes. Hi Scott, it's Oscar. Seeing the operations no longer the financial guy can always use a little more capital here and there. But generally we had adequate level of resources; it\u2019s just that the winter conditions were harsher than in a long, long period of time, which created a little bit of a log jam. I think there is a high level of learnings we\u2019ve had operationally that we\u2019ll obviously include, but we went into the year, into the start of the year with low locomotives, we\u2019ve done a lot of the work on the plan of road over the course of time. And so from a long-term perspective, there are places that we will strategically sort of review with the coming thing, but nothing immediately evident that would have been that helpful. Chicago land terminal, which as you know is the interchange between all of the different railroads that\u2019s where the [create] project is really making a lot of that investment. And I think continuing that is probably the biggest investment the industry can make to make that fluidity in that location better. Scott Group - Wolfe Research :  So, any implications on capital, it sounds like not really? Oscar Munoz :  Not now. Scott Group - Wolfe Research :  From CSX\u2019s perspective. Okay. All right, thanks for the time guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. You may ask your question. Michael Ward :  Good morning, Jason. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company:  Good morning, guys. Two quick questions here. One for Oscar, I\u2019m sorry one for Clarence. Clarence you mentioned you guys had to bring down some of the export rates due to the benchmark weakening a bit. If the benchmark starts recovering, how quickly can you bring those rates back up? Clarence Gooden :  Within a quarter. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company:  Within a quarter. Okay. And the last question is for Michael. Michael I have done this a while and Chicago has always been a major interchange issue for the rail industry. It should have improved I guess over the last 10 years with (inaudible) [EJ and E&N] and taking some pressure off of sort of that downtown area? What\u2019s the need in going forward in terms of capital investments by the railroads maybe as jointly or with some help from the government because it\u2019s pretty much still sort of playing after all these years? Michael Ward : Two things; one, you\u2019re certainly correct that we need to put some better infrastructure and that is the create project which we\u2019re in the process of working and there is money from the railroads, from the state of Illinois and federal money to improve the fluidity in Chicago. But I will remind you though, friendly we looked at the statistics in Chicago going back to I think it was 1871, they kept records from then. Normally you can have a cold winter or you can a snowy winter, you\u2019d rarely have both. This was the third snowiest winter in Chicago, the third coldest winter in Chicago. I think they had 32 snow days, they closed schools in Chicago, which is really rare. So, this is an extraordinarily tough winter that exacerbated some of the natural challenges in Chicago. So yes, as an industry we are putting more capital in there, but I think we do need to put the context of how severe this winter was when we think of what happened this year. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company: And what happened this year, maybe accelerate some of the industry\u2019s plans to pick Chicago? Michael Ward : Well, quite frankly the railroad piece, the money for the railroad elements of it because create not only helps the rail freight infrastructure; it also helps the commuters, it also helps the interface at [gray] crossings and those sorts of things. The money related to the rail freight infrastructure is being provided by the rails today. The federal and state money for the other aspects, the commuter and the interface, crossings et cetera is coming a little bit slower just because of some of the budget challenges in those states comparatively. So, that\u2019s moving at a slower pace, but the freight piece is moving forward faster. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company:  Okay. Gentlemen thank you for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning Ben. Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird: Hey, good morning guys. Just want to circle back Fredrik, we addressed this earlier in the Q&A but in terms of abandoning that sub-70 OR target for 2015. I want to understand the reasons I believe it\u2019s on the export coal side, specifically on the pricing side, but Clarence I think you as well have made a comment about volumes frankly in the first quarter being slightly stronger than you guys had anticipated and we know that the settlement prices are lower here on the margin in the second quarter. So Fredrik maybe if you could provide just some context into really what is driving the lack of confidence there for 2015, in terms of that line of sight to the sub-70 OR and when you say that you will need some help, is it simply on the export coal pricing front or are there other opportunities even at current pricing levels in the export market that would allow you that would provide for that help to get back into that sub-70 OR for 2015? Fredrik Eliasson :  Sure. And I won\u2019t say we have abandoned it, what we said is that we need some help from where we see things today. As we do a bottoms up view of thing, we are going to need some help and that help can come from different places, it doesn\u2019t have to be from export coal, but particular to that while Clarence up, you are right, our export coal market has done better than we\u2019ve thought from a volume perspective, as you also heard, we will continue to make adjustments on the right side to make sure we optimize our bottom line and of course try to do what we can to keep the U.S. producers in the business. At these low levels in terms of underlying commodity prices, it is unknown to us or it\u2019s difficult for us to predict, how long this would be able to sustain, how long will the producers be able to be competitive in marketplace. So until we see some sort of an uptick there, it\u2019s hard to be too bullish on 2015 in terms of what our overall volumes will do. But it's not defined to that, if we can as I said earlier get help from other places as well in terms of more price, more productivity, the economy is doing well. And so we continue to target, we continue to think that that's where we want to be. At the same time, one of the things that we try to do as a company is to be very transparent about how we see things and that's really I think pretty consistent with the two public appearance I had in the quarter in terms of saying what we need in order to be able to get there. We certainly haven't given up volume, we certainly haven't abandoned it. Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird: Of course, okay. And then if I can ask a follow-on in terms of the mid 60s OR target longer term. Do you have comfort that at current global segment prices on the export coal market that you can -- that this mid 30 million tons run rate is an appropriate run rate going forward. And that with the component of productivity gains and volume growth and coal price growth, you have visibility overtime to be able to get to that mid 60s OR that how we should look at that longer term target? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, we think about pulling the three levers that we have, price, volume, productivity, so we do a long-term modeling. We still feel comfortable that we will be able to get that mid 60s level, obviously it\u2019s taken longer than we expected for that, because of the fact that we have lost $800 million from coal revenue in two years alone here and we still have some headwinds, we're facing this year. But even at the current levels as we model things out, we will get there overtime, it\u2019s just look at longer than we had anticipated originally. Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thanks. Our next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Your may ask your questions. Michael Ward : Good morning Cherilyn. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities : Thanks very much and good morning. In your testimony before the STB last week I think I heard Cressey Brown indicate that you had recently acquired a new route through Chicago. And just given all of the focus on Chicago currently, I just wondered if you could give a bit of color on that and how it might be strategic to you going forward? Michael Ward :  Yes Cherilyn, this is Michael. We acquired the Elliston sub of this Canadian National in our swap ratio. When they acquired the EJ&E, they didn\u2019t need that route any more. So, we acquired that from them and we are currently once this weather is broken we are making improvements to that route to allow additional fluidity in the Chicago area. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities : And how long would you expect those investments to take before you start seeing some benefits? Oscar Munoz :  Those are -- Cherilyn, this is Oscar. By mid-year, let\u2019s say July we should be fully operational. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities : Okay. And then just one last quick question; in terms of the double-digit volume growth that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple weeks in your carloads, do you have any feel for how much of that is pent-up demand versus real organic traffic growth? Oscar Munoz :  I think a lot of that is pent-up demand, but at the same time though we still feel that the economy, as I said in prepared remarks, continues to be very vibrant and we are also seeing our coal business now finally is picking up. So the underlying volume trend is also very positive, but there is no doubt that there is a fair amount of that double-digit volume growth that is related to just catching up of things we didn\u2019t move in the first quarter. Michael Ward :  But I would add to that, the economy is forecast to grow let\u2019s call roughly 3%. We think our merchandise and intermodal business we can grow faster than that rate as we did last year, we will do this year as well. So we will be some amount above what that economy is doing with the great service product we\u2019ve been providing. So, we do need to temper down a little bit, because it is pent-up demand, but it\u2019s also a strong demand in the base business. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities : Great, thank you. That\u2019s all from me. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Hi David. David Vernon - Bernstein: It\u2019s David Vernon with Bernstein. Michael Ward : Hi David. David Vernon - Bernstein: Hey good morning. Just maybe a higher level of question, if you think about the slower rate of operating margin development and keeping CapEx is higher, is there a point where you need to start thinking about the capital budget a little bit differently just to ensure overall returns are kind of getting to an upward trajectory? Michael Ward : David, this is Michael. One, I think what I think is the slower operating margin growth; I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d necessary agree to that base premise. I mean if we look at our business and strip out the effect of the loss of that coal business over the last couple of years, we are in the high single to low double-digits growth on the other businesses, and once we get through this transition, we will produce that kind of growth. Now to do that we have to make the investments necessary to support it, so that 16% to 17% of revenues that we\u2019ve held with the last few years, we still think that is the appropriate level. We do need to make strategic investments in our intermodal as we\u2019re going to capture that growth opportunity, we think there are 9 million truckloads out there that we can go after and we have to make the investments necessary to do so. So we still think the 16 to 17 is the appropriate level and it will produce value for our shareholders as we grow the business and the margins. David Vernon - Bernstein: You don\u2019t get concerned at all about the asset turns created by the mix headwind towards lower revenue intermodal? Michael Ward : No, because of lots of lower revenue doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a lower margin. So if we look at the margins on the intermodal business it\u2019s as good as our other margins for our merchandise businesses. So, as good margin business it\u2019s lower RPU, but what we get paid for doing is producing margin not necessarily revenue per unit. So we think it\u2019s good business and we\u2019ll lower the overall RPU, but we\u2019ll increase our profitability, which is what we really need to do. David Vernon - Bernstein: All right, I appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning Walter Walter Spracklin - RBC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my call here. I just have two follow-up questions really, one is for Clarence on the export coal side and the guidance that you provided with regards to the neutral on the second quarter, I know Chris kind of asked this. But just to clarify, if we reflect in -- you did 11.5 million tons last year, you did 10.5 last quarter even though we do say 10.5 this quarter it would imply a step down of over 20% in the back half of the year to get to about 36 million tons. So I just -- is that what you are guiding or are we just giving a little bit more room for upside in the case that\u2019s the back half turns out to be better than we are expecting? Clarence Gooden : Walter I guess someone was to hint me up (inaudible) what are you really guiding? I\u2019m guiding that this market is very volatile that has a $120 a ton in Queensland, you will get there, your guess is as good as mine, it is extremely volatile. With thermal coal sale in Europe between $75 and $79 a ton, some of the things we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter really defy what has been historical norm. It\u2019s highly speculative, we\u2019ve worked with our producers to try to stay in the marketplace right now and it\u2019s just too soon for us to bid on. So we\u2019ve got a fairly clear line of sight of what the next two, three months look like, but to tell you what the third and fourth quarter looks like is just going way out in the [lamp]. Walter Spracklin - RBC: Okay, all right. That makes a lot of sense. Okay. I appreciate that color. Staying with you Clarence here on intermodal pricing, again a clarification question, lot of moving parts in the last few quarters with regards to fuel recapture or quite the opposite of lower fuel surcharge, firming truckload market or trucking market. If we strip all that out now on a base level going forward, we do see average RPU in intermodal flat or up going forward? Clarence Gooden : Up. Walter Spracklin - RBC: Okay. That's all my questions. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning. Justin Long - Stephens: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, first one I had was on core pricing. You talked about overall core pricing being up about 50 basis points year-over-year, but could you talk about the headwind this number saw from the lower level of rail inflation. I'm just trying to understand the overall core pricing environment absent any changes in inflationary mechanisms. Would you describe it as stable or are you seeing some type of moderation? Clarence Gooden : Well, you saw core inflation was around 1.4% from global insight. When you took coal out of the mix, we were about 2.6% that was down from what it was a year ago, which was around 3.3% in the merchandise and the intermodal markets. So, we are pricing above rail inflation in our basic markets. The coal markets are being mainly impacted and influenced what's happening in the global coal market. So I would tell you that we are seeing stability in our general freight, in our general merchandise markets. As we are seeing capacity demands as just witnessed by the previous questions, we think that will firm up through the year as we go forward from where we are today. Depending on what happens to these coal markets, we think we have seen the near bottom start to approach in global markets in coal. So, the trend should be upward in the future in there. Justin Long - Stephens: Okay, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow up, I was wondering if you could talk about the industrial development opportunity and your current pipeline of projects seems to be pretty robust, is there any possible way to quantify how much this could contribute to volume growth in 2014. Michael Ward :  I don\u2019t have that number right off the top of my head. I am sorry. Justin Long - Stephens: Okay, that\u2019s fine. Maybe you could just provide some color on some of the opportunities as far as industrial development and what you are seeing and just kind of how that pipeline looks in general? Michael Ward :  Well one of the things that we are seeing as a result of the expansion in the oil and the gas industry is a lot of the development is happening in the Marcellus area with fractionators either located on CSX or on the short lines that be into CSX. We have 5 new fractionating facilities located on. So each one of those are producing between 15 and 20 cars a day of byproducts of the gas industry that are coming on to CSX. That\u2019s positive for us. We have 2 new ethylene crackers that have been announced on CSX as a result of that. So those tend to be for lack better phrase, [annuities] going forward for us on CSX. So you are seeing a lot of developments in those areas. In the last I guess 18 months we have seen a lot of activity in general in industrial development as economies begin to expand with new industries on CSX. I think last year we announced almost $1.5 billion, $2 billion worth of new industries that are locating on CSX. So you are seeing a lot of economic activity now as economy is getting to expand. Justin Long - Stephens: Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll leave it at that. I appreciate the time. Michael Ward : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning Keith. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar: Yes, thanks. I am in Chicago and actually calling you from an igloo this morning. I\u2019d appreciate those comments on uncertainty of export coal demand and wanted turn to domestic with a couple of quick questions. Fredrik mentioned expectations of 2015 was probably the midyear and domestic coal volumes. I know there is no crystal ball, but I just want to clarify for your thinking that based on current information you expect domestic coal will be flat or up from here on say indefinitely next 3 to 5 years? Fredrik Eliasson : No, no, we expect growth in the mid to high single-digits for the rest of this year in 2014 in domestic coal. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar: And then beyond the current year? Fredrik Eliasson : Well I expect 2015 also be -- I don\u2019t see much beyond 2015 right now at this point. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar: Okay. And then if I recall correctly, Illinois and Powder River Basins constitute about half of your recent utility carloads. And I\u2019d like to ask about your expectations for next same time period 2 to 3 years from now? Fredrik Eliasson : 2 to 3 years, right now you\u2019re right; it\u2019s running just slightly above 50% in both of those markets. So, we expect to see growth continuing in both, particularly in the Illinois Basin coals. Michael Ward : We\u2019re actually making capital investments on that line near Illinois Basin to allow us to muster those unit trains more efficiently. When is that expected to be done, Oscar? Oscar Munoz : Again probably third quarter of this year. Michael Ward : So we\u2019re putting infrastructure in because we do think that Illinois Basin is going to be a continual growing market for us. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar: You did that infrastructure\u2019s track? Michael Ward : It\u2019s (inaudible) to be able to assemble unit trains and move them more efficiently. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from (inaudible) Macquarie Capital. You may ask your question. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. And thank you for your patience. My first question relates to again the outlook for the export coal market. Could you help us understand your leverage to recovery in met-coal across your book of business contracted and spot and also what your assumptions are with regards to this market in your guidance or double-digit EPS growth for next year? Michael Ward : The leverage in met-coal, is that your question? Clarence Gooden : The rebound, what kind of leverage\u2026 Unidentified Analyst : Yes, how fast can you benefit from recovery in pricing? And then on volumes given that you have mix of contracted and spot business and if you could also clarify how much of your contracted business is up for renewal this year, that will also help? Michael Ward : Okay. Our export coal business is priced on quarterly basis. So our ability to leverage and to response to the marketplace, we would be able to do so on a quarterly basis. Clarence Gooden : So bid upticks, we can move\u2026 Michael Ward : And this fall within the quarter. Unidentified Analyst : All right. And with regards to your guidance for \u201815, what kind of outlook do you have embedded for export coal? Oscar Munoz : I think what we have said is that, that is one market that we are concerned about in terms of how long we can see the sort of positive volume despite having the underlying commodity markets as weak as they are, but we haven\u2019t given a specific number in terms of what we are assuming for 2015. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. And my follow-up is really regards to the past to your mid 60s operating ratio long term, can you help or shed some light on to, into what you mean by long term and the main drivers especially from the hurdle put by this hard winter? Oscar Munoz : Well, in terms of the mid 60s, we\u2019ve talked about earlier on the call today. And we -- because of the fact that we\u2019ve lost so much momentum in the $800 million of coal revenue that\u2019s gone away, it has been pushed out longer than we have originally anticipated, we are going to have to get there little differently than our original plans, but we are still confident and as we look at our long-term modeling, as we look at our pricing, productivity and volume opportunities that we will get there, we are not going to put a timeframe on it today, but clearly that we need to be long term in order to be able to reinvest in the business the way we wanted to be able to do. Unidentified Analyst : So, it could be [3 or 5] I guess? Oscar Munoz : We have not put a timeframe on that. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. Michael Ward : Well, everyone thank you for your attendance, interest in the company. And we\u2019ll talk to you again next quarter. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. You may disconnect your lines.",

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations for CSX Corporation. David Baggs : Thank you and good morning everyone. And again welcome to CSX Corporation's second quarter 2014 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we\u2019ll review this morning along with our quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at csx.com under the Investor section. In addition, following the presentation, a webcast and podcast replay will be available on that same website. Here representing CSX this morning are Michael Ward, the company\u2019s Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Clarence Gooden, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; Oscar Munoz, Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, Chief Financial Officer. Now, before we begin the formal part of our program, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company\u2019s disclosure in the accompanying presentation on Slide two. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause performance to materially differ from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, let me also remind everyone that at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. That said, with nearly 30 analysts covering CSX, I would ask, as a courtesy to everyone, to please limit your inquiries to one primary and one follow-up question. And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael? Michael Ward : Well thank you, David and good morning everyone. Last evening, CSX reported record second quarter earnings per share of $0.53, up from $0.51 in the same period last year. CSX also generated record revenues of $3.2 billion for the quarter, up 7% on an 8% volume increase. These results are evidence of the broad-based economic momentum across most markets and a transition in the energy markets that is largely behind us. We handled volume levels this quarter that exceeded our expectations, while maintaining stable operations and we're taking additional steps to return service to the high levels that our customers have come to expect from CSX over the last few years. We're excited about the growth we are seeing and what it means for the future of this company and our shareholders. That's why we've added people and capacity including locomotives, freight cars and infrastructure. Oscar will discuss these initiatives in more detail later in the presentation. Thanks for the efforts of CSX's 31,000 employees, the company produced record operating income of nearly $1 billion and delivered an operating ratio of 69.3%. As we look to the back half of the year, CSX is focused on improving service levels, leveraging the growth opportunities before us and generating modest earnings growth for the full year 2014. Now I'll turn the presentation over to Clarence, who will take us through the topline results in more detail, Clarence? Clarence Gooden : Thank you, Michael and good morning. The underlying macro-economy remains strong and our experience and the data suggest a positive outlook for growth. The Purchasing Managers Index held firm at 55.3 in June. A rating above 50 indicates that the manufacturing economy is expanding. This is the 13th consecutive month that PMI index has signaled expansion. At the same time, the Customer's Inventories Index remained at 46.5. A rating below 50 indicates customer's inventories are low and suggests continued strength and demand for manufacturing output. As a result, many of the customer's reserve grew at a robust pace and most of the key indicators we track including vehicle production, housing starts and agricultural output, point to continued expansion. Overall demand for rail service was very strong in the second quarter. Now let's look at the results on the next slide. As you can see on the left side of the chart, total volume grew over 8% to nearly 1.8 million loads in the quarter with strong growth in merchandise, intermodal and coal. Moving to the right, total revenue increased $198 million to over $3.2 billion in the quarter, reflecting overall volume growth and increased pricing across most markets. Merchandise and intermodal now account for over three quarters of CSX\u2019s overall revenue. Total revenue includes $11 million of liquidated damages related to contract shortfalls and coal shipment. We expect similar levels in the remaining quarters of this year. Looking forward, we'll be cycling $51 million of liquidated damages from the third quarter of 2013. Next the average revenue per unit was down slightly. Here core pricing gains in our merchandize and intermodal markets were offset by the impact of mix and lower coal revenue per unit. Finally, let's move to core pricing. Recall that same-store sales are defined as shipments with the same customer, commodity and car type, and the same margin and destination. These shipments represent 75% of CSX\u2019s traffic base for the quarter. On this basis, all-in pricing was a negative 0.6% in the quarter, reflecting continued rate pressure in export coal markets and the impact of fixed variable contracts and the domestic utility market where volumes are now increasing. Since we continue to have greater variability in both our export and domestic coal business, reflecting global market conditions and our fixed variable contract structure and since our merchandise and intermodal markets are becoming a larger portion of our business, we have again provided you with the same-store sales pricing for these two markets on a combined basis. At the bottom of this panel, you can see pricing for merchandise and intermodal average 2.6% for the quarter. This pricing gain is smaller on a year-over-year basis, but is flat sequentially and represents a solid spread over rail inflation. That said, we remain confident that the value we create for our customers compared with the increasing demand for our service product provides a solid foundation for growth and pricing above rail inflation over the long-term. Now let\u2019s look at the individual markets in more detail, starting with merchandise. Overall, merchandise revenue increased 11% to nearly $2 billion in the quarter. Volume in the agricultural sector was up 5%. Feed grain shipments, both domestic and export, increased sharply due to a strong 2013 harvest. In addition, ethanol shipments grew as lower corn prices resulted in higher ethanol production levels. The construction sector grew 8% overall, reflecting a rebound in shipments after the winter weather subsided and the ongoing recovery of housing and construction activity. Finally the industrial sector grew 11% led by strength in the energy-related commodities including crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas and frac sand. Moving to the next slide, let\u2019s review the intermodal business. Intermodal revenue increased 6% to nearly $450 million. Total volume grew 7%, setting a new quarterly record for intermodal. Domestic volume was up 8%, driven by continued highway to rail conversions. International volume was up 6% year-over-year reflecting continued economic growth catch-up from the first quarter and advanced shipments due to potential port labor issues. Total intermodal revenue per unit declined 2% as continued core pricing gains and higher fuel recoveries were offset by unfavorable mix. Here volume associated with our door-to-door domestic business, which has higher revenue per unit declined. Finally, we continue to grow our intermodal business by adding new service offerings and making strategic investments. These investments include the new terminal in Winter Haven, Florida, which opened early this quarter; the Montreal terminal, which will open later in the year. These two terminals together will add 350,000 in annual lift capacity. In addition the ongoing expansion of the Northwest Ohio facility will increase its capacity by 50%. Moving to the next slide, let\u2019s review the coal business. Coal volume increased 6% while revenue declined 3% in the quarter to $744 million. Domestic coal volume increased 15% with growth in both northern and southern utility shipments, reflecting higher gas prices, building of stock piles for the summer cooling season and a competitive gain. Export coal tonnage declined 12% as global market conditions for both thermal and metallurgical coals remain solid. The API2 benchmark for thermal coal remained below $75 per ton, a level where the U.S. coals were challenged to compete. The Queensland metallurgical coal benchmark has also remained at low levels with a rate of $120 per ton. Finally, total revenue per unit was down 9% with lower export pricing, fixed variable utility contracts and unfavorable domestic mix negatively impacting revenue per unit. Now let me wrap up with the outlook for the third quarter. Looking forward, we expect a positive demand environment in the third quarter with stable to favorable conditions for 88% of our markets and unfavorable conditions for the remaining 12%. Looking at some of the key markets, agriculture is favorable and will continue to benefit from last year's record harvest. We expect growth in chemicals as we continue to capture opportunities created by expanding domestic oil and gas industry. The automotive market will grow with North American light vehicle production expected to increase 9% in the quarter. Strong intermodal growth will continue as our strategic network investments and improving service reliability support highway to rail conversions. We expect domestic coal volume will grow in the third quarter at double-digit rates as utilities continue to rebuild inventories. Forest products is neutral as growth in buildings products due to the continued recovery of the housing markets will be offset by lower paper shipments. Export coal volume is expected to be significantly lower in the third quarter and our best estimate of 2014 volume remains in the mid 30 million ton range, reflecting soft global market conditions, particularly in the thermal market. Overall, we expect high levels of demand for our service will continue into the third quarter. Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Oscar to review our operating results. Oscar Munoz : Thank you, Clarence. It\u2019s great news and good morning, everyone. As you know, we always start our operations review with a look at safety as it is our first and foremost priority. We are proud to report that CSX remains a leader in safety amongst the Class one railroads with the train accident and personal injury rates both improving year-over-year. For the quarter, the train accident rate declined to 2.07 and the personal injury rate declined to 0.90, reflecting the company's and our employees continued commitment to community and employee safety. Let let's turn to service performance on the next slide. System wide operating performance is still below the level customers have come to expect from CSX, especially across our Northern tier. In the second quarter, the robust demand we experienced has led to a decline in on-time originations and arrivals as well as resource constraints in some areas of the network. In addition, line of road congestion has impacted train velocity and terminal dwell. On Slide 15, I'll discuss service in a bit more detail. As you can see on the chart on the left, service levels began to decline at the beginning of the year due to the historic winter we experienced. For the end of the first quarter, we experienced a rapid surge in volume. Even with a significantly higher volume, service levels have stabilized albeit at a lower level. If you look at the map on the right, much of that volume growth this year has been concentrated in the Northern part of our network. Traffic levels for the northern tier are up approximately 20% with certain areas experiencing even higher growth rates. Turning to Slide 16, let's discuss some of the actions we are taking to support this continued growth in CSX's business. The map on the left shows four key areas where CSX has been marking strategic capacity additions. You'll notice that many of these projects are along the northern tier and will help facilitate long term growth across this part of our network. In the Chicago area, the addition of the Elsdon Sub division provides CSX with additional double track miles. This allows us to operate a shorter, fast route for certain trains, diverting traffic away from other more congested routes in the area. As Clarence mentioned, we're also extending the processing capabilities of the Northwest Ohio terminal, which we expect to be complete by the end of this year. Along the river line route in New York and New Jersey, we're adding more miles of double track to improve capacity along this growing and heavily travelled path from Chicago to New York. Finally we are investing in a new coal unit train processing facility that will support the increased growth of coal coming out of the Illinois basin. Now let's turn to the next slide and discuss crews and locomotive. The train and engine employee count is already up 200 since the beginning of the year and we expect it to be up approximately 400 by the end of the year. We also have some initiatives in place to enhance workforce levels in the near term including temporary transfers, vacation buyout and incentives to delay retirements. On the chart on the right, you can see our available locomotive count has increased by 10% since September of last year as we pulled out units out of storage and taken on additional leases. Looking at the second half of the year, we expect our available count to further increase as we repair and reactivate approximately 100 more locomotives. These actions will help CSX gradually restore fluidity to the network and to support growth. Turning to the next slide, let me discuss the cost base. Now Fredrik will provide more specifics about the cost impacts for this quarter and what to expect going forward, let me outline a few of the key drivers behind the $32 million of additional cost in the second quarter associated with our network performance. On the chart on the left, the number of [released drivers] (ph) continues to be more than double of prior year levels. In addition, over time across the operating department also remains above prior year levels, although it has improved sequentially from the first quarter. Now if I could, I would say a quick thank you to our employees for their continued hard work these past few months. I greatly appreciate your professionalism and dedication to serve customers. I continue with the chart and moving down as I've discussed, our locomotive fleet has increased 10% since the beginning of the fourth quarter and 8% year-over-year in an effort to meet the growing demand. With many of our additions coming from short term sources, lease expenses increased. In addition, maintenance expense is up due to the higher overall fleet count. Finally, average freight car cycle days were up 3%, reflecting the increase in transit time and leading to higher rental expense. Looking forward, these costs will subside as service levels improve. Now let me wrap up on the next slide. Overall service has stabilized with this higher volume and are not at the levels our customers have come to expect from CSX. At a network level, the northern level, the northern tier has experienced strong double-digit growth and Chicago in particular has been challenged. In response, we're working closely with our rail peers and taking near term actions to shift resources to these high growth areas. We have plans in place to further improve our infrastructure as well as add crews and locomotives to support ongoing growth initiatives. Also an importantly, we've been in regular contact with our customers to provide them visibility and sincerely thank them for their patience as we work to increase their increased demand. They, and you, should be confident that our dedicated operating employees remain fully committed to restoring service levels to what our customers have come to expect from CSX. So with that, let me turn over the presentation to Fredrik to review the financials. Fredrik Eliasson : Thank you, Oscar and good morning everyone. Let me begin by providing a summary of our second quarter results. Revenue increased 7% versus the prior year on 8% higher volume, driven by broad based strength across our merchandize, intermodal and domestic coal markets. Expenses increased 7% versus last year, driven primarily by higher volume, the cycling of real estate gains and cost associated with network performance, which I'll discuss in more detail in the coming slides. Operating income was $997 million, up 6% or $57 million versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense was down $5 million versus last year driven by favorable interest rates on debt that was refinanced in 2013 and modestly lower debt levels. Other income declined $21 million versus the prior year, primarily due to environmental charges for non-operating site and income taxes were $321 million in the quarter for an effective tax rate of 37.8%. Overall, net earnings were $529 million and EPS was $0.53 per share, up slightly from $521 and $0.51 respectively in the prior period. With that, let\u2019s turn to the next slide and briefly discuss how fuel lag impacted the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the effect of the lag in our fuel surcharge program was unfavorable by $9 million. This reflects $4 million of positive in-quarter lag during the second quarter of this year versus $13 million of positive in-quarter lag for the same period in the prior year. Based on the current forward curve, we expect the year-over-year fuel lag impact to be slightly favorable in the third quarter. Turning to the next slide, let\u2019s review our expenses. Overall expenses increased 7% in the quarter. I'll talk about the top three expense items in more detail on the next slide, but let me first briefly speak to the bottom two on this chart. Depreciation was up 4% to $287 million due to a higher net asset base. Going forward, we continue to expect depreciation to increase sequentially a few million dollars per quarter, reflecting the ongoing investment in our business. Equipment rent was up 19% to $114 million driven by higher freight car rates, incremental volume and longer car cycles. Now turning to the next slide, let's discuss our other expenses. Overall labor and labor and fringe, MS&O and fuel expense each increased versus the prior year, driven primarily by 8% high volume in the second quarter. As Oscar mentioned earlier, we incurred $32 million of additional expense in the quarter, related to network performance. Of that amount, $14 million is attributable to labor and fringe, $9 is in MS&O and finally there was $9 million of impact in equipment rent expense. This cost of network performance represents a significant improvement from the $90 million impact we experienced in the first quarter. Looking for to the second half, we expect these costs to remain relatively consistent with the second quarter levels, until we see meaningful improvement in network fluidity and service levels. Now let me discuss the other drivers for each of expense categories beginning on the left with labor and fringe. Total labor and fringe increased 4% or $32 million versus last year. $25 million of this increase was related to incremental volume and $14 million related to inflation. For the second half of 2014 we expect labor inflation to continue to be around $15 million on a year-over-year basis each quarter. The $21 million improvement in other labor and fringe is driven by lower incentive compensation and pension expense versus the prior year and is split about 50-50 between those two items. Headcount was up about 1% versus our first quarter level as T&E employees increased to accommodate higher volume. Looking ahead, we expect overall headcount to gradually increase during the second half such that by year end our headcount will be up 1% to 2% versus the end of 2013. Moving to the right on the slide, MS&O expense increased 11% or $61 million versus last year. This included the cycling of $36 million in real estate gains, $19 million of expenses related to incremental volume and $10 million of inflation. In addition, there was $13 million of decrease in other MS&O spending multiple items none of which was individually significant. Looking at the remaining quarters of 2014, we continue to expect higher year-over-year MS&O expense related to the inflation and volume growth and there are no further real estate gains to be cycled in the second half. Finally, fuel expense increased 5% or $19 million versus last year as the impact of higher volume was partially offset by favorable price and efficiency. Now that concludes the expense review, turning to the next slide, I\u2019d like to highlight our core earnings growth and operating margins in the second quarter. Looking at the second quarter financial results and excluding the $36 million of real estate gains from last year, the company generated $198 million of revenue growth that was partially offset by a $105 million of incremental expense. This netted to an increase in core operating income of $93 million versus the prior year or an incremental operating margin of 47%. As a reminder, these results included the $32 million of network performance cost that I discussed earlier. With a positive outlook across most of the markets in our portfolio, the core earnings strength of CSX's business is now becoming more evident. We expect the core momentum experience in this quarter to carry over the second half and produce modest earnings growth for the full year and double-digit growth starting next year. This expectation is the foundation for the increase in capital that we're now planning for 2014 which I\u2019ll discuss on the next slide. Total investment is now expected to be $2.4 billion up from $2.3 billion we initially budgeted for the year. About $100 million of additional capital will be deployed for infrastructure and freight cars both of which will support long term growth. As a result, our revised core capital budget is now $2.1 billion which is consistent with our guidance of 16% to 17% of revenue. In addition, we still expect to invest $300 million in positive train control this year Now, let me wrap-up on the next slide. First, the core earnings improvement of CSX's business is becoming more apparent in our financial results. And we see broad base strength across our diverse business portfolio which will be key to drive sustainable long term earnings growth. As a result, we are investing in infrastructure, crews and locomotives to effectively serve demand and gradually return service to the superior levels that our customer expects. Looking forward, we expect third quarter earnings to be roughly flat versus the prior year as we cycle $51 million in liquidated damages and tax feasibility of $0.01 in EPS while continuing to incur network performance cost. We expect more meaningful earnings growth in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier we still expect modest earnings growth for the full year 2014 and we remain confident in CSX's ability to sustain double-digit EPS growth starting 2015 and operating ratio in the mid 60s longer term. With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks. Michael Ward : Thank you, Fredrik. As we discussed this morning CSX experienced substantial demand across nearly our entire portfolio and delivered record financial results for the quarter. Going forward, we see a strong economic environment that is expected to continue and operations that are stable and expected to gradually improve with the actions we are taking. What's even more exciting is that in a reshaped energy environment and with intermodal and merchandise an ever growing part of our portfolio, the core earnings strength of this company is apparent and attractive. To those reasons we continue to expect double-digit earnings growth and margin expansion beginning in 2015. Now we'll be glad to take your questions. Operator :  Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Rob Salmon from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Rob. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : Hey, good morning guys. I guess to kind of follow-up with regard to the service discussion, could you give us a little bit of a sense in terms of the timeline of how the network fluidity should be improving with regard to some of the capital investments that you are making, particularly on the intermodal side where we basically have been seeing the velocity kind of come down since basically the May timeframe? I am assuming this is related to the headwinds that you guys called out in the Northern region, any sort of incremental color and how we should be thinking about those costs coming out? It sounds like it's more of a probably 2015 story in terms of getting the velocity and the dwell down to the levels that you guys like. Oscar Munoz : Yes Rob, this is Oscar. I think all you say is generally correct. I just would re-highlight what we talked about before is we do have a lot of plans to add to resources and are in constant communication with our customers across all areas. Now assuming our demand remains as strong as we expect, which we do, the recovery will be gradual as we work through the challenges especially across the north. I can't provide a specific timeframe at this point for a lot of different reasons, but the recovery will not be necessarily linear. And so that said, as you\u2019ve seen in this quarter, even with this additional operating cost that we're seeing, our incremental margins are improving. So there is a lot of value and good things to look forward to. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then I guess Fredrik, with regard to a follow-up on the guidance for the third quarter, what sort of volume growth are you assuming in that guidance? Fredrik Eliasson : Well, I think overall I think right now what we are seeing here over the last month or so, is in that mid single digit range that we're seeing volume growth. So I think that's probably good place to start. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate the time guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Kim from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Thomas. Tom Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hi. Good morning. Could you provide a little bit more color on the incremental CapEx and where you are planning to be allocating it and your time as to when you anticipate revenue generation from that? Thank you. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure. So about half of it is related to rolling stock that we think we will be able to put in revenue generation next year and about half of it is in infrastructure around the northern tier of our network and obviously as we put that into effect throughout the fall, that should generate incremental fluidity in that part of our network. Tom Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay. That's very helpful and then just with regard to intermodal and the capital reinvestment there, to what extent can you elaborate on how much spillover traffic you see sort of given the strength of demand and your network? How much of the -- how much revenue do you anticipate [indiscernible] actually or do you sort of estimate is actually being lost there because you don't have the capacity and if you could just try to give us a sense of the ramp on the utilization of the two new facilities by year end, that would be helpful as well. Thank you. Clarence Gooden : This was -- Thomas, this is Clarence Gooden. I think it's going to be very difficult for us to say as how much basis we lost or gained during that period of time that you are asking. On the facilities coming online, are you referring to Valley Fair and to Winter Haven? Tom Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Yes, that's right. Clarence Gooden : Winter Haven is progressing along as we expect it to be. Most of the volume in Winter Haven now has moved out of our Orlando facility, which is part of the SunRail deal we had done earlier several years ago with the State of Florida. So it will be several years before we reach capacity -- full capacity in Winter Haven. Valley Fair which will open up in the early fourth quarter, late third quarter we are in the process right now seeing just how big that market total is going to be on day one when we open, we expect we will be running initially a train in and a train out a day. Tom Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay. That helps a lot. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming is from Bill Greene from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Bill. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Clarence, I wanted to take your pulse on something. So we are starting to see throughout transportation a lot of tightness and it's not just rails, but obviously you are seeing it in some of your markets as well. When do we get to the point where capacity is tight enough that you\u2019ve got to start looking at ways to meter out the scarce capacity of your network? In other words kind of using price as a way to sort of encourage the customers to get in line for access to that network. How do you think about where we are in that tightness on capacity? Clarence Gooden : Bill, I think we're a long way from where we should be on the tightness on capacity from just a sheer standpoint of how much we can handle. Remember that today we are essentially at 2007 volume levels. The problem that we have when the surge came fast and quick and furious on us and that's what's dipped our hand here. So we have plenty of capacity to meet the demand of our customers and our common carrier obligation now. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : So when you look at your core pricing that you just reported, so all in down a little bit, is service and impediments to changing that direction even without coal, we've seen a deceleration. What sort of changes the direction in pricing in your mind? Clarence Gooden : I think that the deceleration that you saw particularly on the merchandize side on a year-over-year basis was a result of a weakness in the economy that we had had in the previous years and some duration lingering effects of that contracts that were in place. Going forward I think all modes of transportation have an opportunity to price up, price up significantly, particularly in this type of economic environment. When you couple that with what is happening in 2014 and you look at the projections for 2015, we are in a very robust pricing market in virtually all modes of transportation. So up is the way the direction looks to me. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Okay. All right. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Ken. Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America : Good morning. Clarence, just jumping back on to the -- looking at the revenue outlook there a bit for the quarter, domestic coal you mentioned double-digit growth for this upcoming quarter, but when you look at 2015, what are your thoughts in terms of volumes knowing that you still have that seven million tons that needs to be phased out or even move to others. Is that why you are sourcing more to Illinois Basin? Does that make up for it? What are your thoughts as you're looking at 2015? Clarence Gooden : Ken, I think 2015 for domestic utility coal is still going to be a robust year for multiple reasons. One, the stock piles now are way down. Two, as long as gas stays particularly for Illinois Basin above $3.50 for the Southeast, it makes coal competitive in the mix. Three, is that we still don't know if we are going to have what will the winter of 2014's effect is going in. Four, I think the utilities are tended to lean more now to having sufficient stock piles rather than having insufficient stock piles to meet their customer's demand. Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America : That's good. So you are still seeing the outlook for growth as you move forward, not falling back to the continued annual declines. Clarence Gooden : Absolutely, growth in coal in 2015. Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America : Wonderful and Oscar, just to follow-up with you on the service side, is there -- you mentioned the $32 million of internal cost and I know you were talking about velocity before, but with on-time originations down at 56%, what can you do to get back on track on those metrics? Is there anything that you need to do differently or kind of resell operations to get back to running fluidly? Oscar Munoz : Yes Ken, as you might expect, we have pretty much pulled out every playbook and every plan in the playbook over the course of time. Service performance has such a large interrelated issues that we talk a lot about power and talk a lot about crews, but infrastructure is important in some of this growth in the Northern tier has caused a little bit of congestion. We feel very confident in our process and we do have a really good playbook and feel really it is -- we are focusing on service and safety keeping in constant contact with our customers and getting this business moved. It's costing us a little bit and that cost will decline, but there is in a whole lot else to be done than what we've already outlined as doing. Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America : Appreciate the time, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Brandon. Keith Mori \u2013 Barclays: Good morning. This is Keith Mori on for Brandon. Congratulations on the strong quarter. Just one question here on service Oscar, we saw $32 million in the quarter, can you may be help us split out what was needed for may be just returning metrics to after winter and how much of the cost were actually geared towards an increase in volume that we could think about going. How should we think about I guess those costs going forward to meet that rising volume Clarence was speaking to? Oscar Munoz : Yeah, I think we've already bifurcated the volume oriented cost in that $30 million unfortunately is all related to sort of service impacts. I break that out between crew, cost, leased horsepower hours and the car hire that we're having to work through in those categories and that's roughly ran us above $10 million a month kind of split between the three components. Keith Mori \u2013 Barclays: Or should we think that it could accelerate into the third quarter given that you're going to pick up a little bit here on labor and some other items that we didn\u2019t speak to? Oscar Munoz : Our plan is to decelerate. I am not sure how you are using that term. Our hope would be to reduce that cost as the additional crews and power come on. Keith Mori \u2013 Barclays: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Hey Chris. Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citi: Thanks, just touching on the volume outlook for the second quarter, just wanted to get a rough sense, it looks like the last three weeks or so we've seen some pretty elevated numbers, is there just sort of a blip that we're working through when we think about the full quarter? Is mid single digits Fredrik to your point the sort of right number to use. Just want to roughly understand sort of what's going on now and may be how we see the next month or so playing out? Oscar Munoz : Now the numbers you\u2019ve been seeing in the last couple of weeks represent year-over-year comparison and July, which is normally a very down time of the year for us and fortunately has been a very positive time of the year for us. So that's a reason that you're seeing the numbers that you\u2019ve seen in the last two weeks, but I think Fredrik's number of 6% to 7% going forward for the back half of the year is pretty strong. Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citi: Okay. That's helpful. And then when you think about the pricing outlook as we roll into 2015, you have a better -- you have good domestic coal environment. You have a couple of other things working in your favor, but if you have sort of these trends continue, can you grow earnings double-digit if core pricing is flattish or do you needed to pick up and is that sort of inherent in your thoughts about growing double-digit? Just want to get a rough sense of how we think pricing might translate into 2015 with a still good volume environment? Fredrik Eliasson : Well, this is Fredrik. I think the key thing for us that we follow is the spread between our cash and our pricing and so as Clarence indicated, we think that the pricing environment is favorable, is getting more favorable we are going to push price, but it's a spread that is the most important part of this thing and it is assumed that we will get inflation plus pricing as we think about next year and double-digit earnings growth. Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citi: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Allison. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of the resource additions, how do we think about the incremental margins in the back half of the year? And I am particularly curious to see if there was any parallel that we could draw thinking back to the second half of 2011 when you guys also had to add some additional resources to meet demand. Obviously, we are in a much different volume environment, but I wanted to see if there was any consistent way to think about that relative to a couple of years ago? Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah, obviously you're right. Volume environments look different and the mix of business is different, but the outcome in 2011 was positive as we added the resource, we got the fluidity back in at work and we got to a better place and that's essentially what we're trying to do here as well. In terms of the incremental margins, we said longer term, we need to be in that 50% and above range and we expect that that will continue. We'll see here in the second half especially in the third quarter as we're cycling the liquidated damages and continue to have network performance rated cost. It might not get all the way there, but longer term, our view is we should clearly especially in this sort of a robust environment being over 50% in terms of incremental margins. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Okay. That actually was very helpful. And just sort of a housekeeping question, just given you\u2019ve made some restatements to the prior year numbers, could you confirm what these 3Q 2013 EPS number was? Was it $0.43? Fredrik Eliasson : The 3Q 2013 number was let me just make sure I have it, it was $0.45 last year. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Okay $0.45. So the guidance for flat is relative to that. Okay. Thank you so much. Fredrik Eliasson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, David. David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein: Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just on the question on the intermodal yields and you're developing there, the door to door intermodal product, is that a conscious choice you guys are making to de-market that door to door service or is that just sort of what's shaking out given the difficulty finding drainage and the market condition. Oscar Munoz : The main factor was that the Transcon part of that door-to-door business is what declined and it carries a very high RPU. The Eastern core part of that business remained reasonably robust just as it requires higher RPU, as does Transcon. David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein: And would you expect that to continue throughout the year or is sort of like a temporary thing associated with maybe some of the service issues coming East West? Oscar Munoz : I would expect right now for the third quarter at least for it to continue. David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein: Okay. And then Fredrik maybe just a longer term question, as you think about the model you need to get to that mid 60s or the high 50s -- high 50s incremental margin, what kind of topline growth assumption do you kind of think about as a longer term sustainable level of growth for you guys? Fredrik Eliasson : The guidance we've given is that going forward we think it's going to be a little bit more balanced between volume inflation plus pricing and productivity than perhaps it's been in the last decade. We like to think that a large part of our business can grow faster in the economy as a whole because of opportunities and the secular trends that we are seeing, but more specific than that, I think it's really hard to beat because it really depends on individual years and what sectors are doing well, but clearly we feel that the volume environment is much more robust going forward than it's been in the last decade after having gone through obviously the housing collapse, the recession that we saw and now this energy transition that we've seen over the last few years. So we think the volume environment is going to be much more constructive going forward than it's been in the past. David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein: And then the pricing stuff will obviously be suffering a little bit on some of the fixed variable stuff with coal though, would that also kind of go forward in terms of yield price for the next year and in fact some for the topline growth rate that's reasonable. Fredrik Eliasson : I mean that the fixed variable, we'll have to see. We obviously have cash in terms of how much the utilities can grow within this current rate structure. So as we go through this year, we will see what the impact is next year, but clearly right now, it's a big negative, but as part of the way that we look at this and we think that's the right strategic move on our part to make sure that we incentivize additional volumes. And as we go through next year, it might be a little bit different. That's where they cycle some of these large gains. So I don't think that's going to be as big of a drive next year as it was this year at least. David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein: All right. Great. Thanks very much for the time guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from John Larkin from Stifel. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, John. John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen and thanks for taking my question. I had a question related to the surge in volume on the northern part of the network and how much of that was originating and terminating on CSX and how much of that is being delivered to you, or you are delivering to the Western railroads, where you\u2019ve had perhaps even more congestion promise, particularly the BNSF. Clarence Gooden : John, this is Clarence. I would say that most of the surge that we had on the Northern part of the railroad was interline business that came, the biggest part of our surge in the north was driven by crude, by rail and by our coal business, our coal business particularly was much higher than what we had expected it to be, primarily as a result of the gas prices, as a result of the colder winter and as a result the great lakes themselves for the utility lake coal closing naturally or due to the weather and opening much later due to the weather. John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.: So is it safe to say that the recovery on service is at least partly a function of how soon Chicago cleans up its service act and how quickly some of the Western carriers return to normal service levels? Oscar Munoz : John, its Oscar. No, I wouldn\u2019t describe it to anything. Remember there is a lot of component pieces and all of us are having difficulty across that interchange. I think the heavy degree of volume concentrated in one area is a problem for all of us. So I think as we all collectively get our stuff together. I think that will all improve. John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.: Is there any possibility of a change in routing protocol to use perhaps other less congested hubs that could help us solve the problem? Oscar Munoz : Absolutely and we are in active communication and conversations with almost every other carrier to do exactly that and we have some great options around that, that I think make sense both from a service perspective and also frankly economically as we see longer term growth coming through that same corridor. John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.: Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Bascome. Bascome Majors \u2013 Susquehanna: Good morning and thank for the time. We should see new draft safety regulations from Pensum moving inflammable liquids by rail in a few weeks here and they are talking about an operational restriction taking crude trains down to 30 miles per hour, can you talk a little bit about how that could impact your business how you are moving that commodity today and whether and how that could spill beyond crude oil if they do decide to go in that direction? Michael Ward : Yeah, this is Michael. I think you are quite right. We've heard as well. We've not seen the proposals, nobody really has yet, but we have heard as you have that 30 miles an hour is one of the options are considering. We think that would be -- severely limit our ability to provide reliable freight service to our customers and to support the timely passengers add communal service. So there is all kinds of corollary impacts of this and I would hope as we look at this with the federal government, we can show them the modeling of how disastrous that could be to the entire fluidity of the U.S. rail system as well as the adverse impact that will have as trucks deliver on to the highway system. So our view is that it would be very bad, but our view is also that cooler heads will prevail when they see the facts behind it. Bascome Majors \u2013 Susquehanna: All right, well thanks for that. And are there any other parts of this rule making that you are watching very closely that could potentially impact your business and whether operationally or from a risk management standpoint? Michael Ward : Actually we are quite excited about the potential for the new car design as well as the retrofits to the existing cars and I know that is part of the proposed rule making. As you know, as a router, we've done a number of things to improve our already very good safety records to make it even more safe and we think the next big movement to make it even better is for a stronger car or new builds as well as retrofit to existing cars. Bascome Majors \u2013 Susquehanna: All right, well thanks for the time this morning. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Jeff Kauffman from Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. Mike, it's really great to hear you talking about coal being up double-digits and it may continue for a while. I was just kind of curious if export coal didn\u2019t exist, give us a sense for kind of what's going on with the yield on the domestic product? Clarence Gooden : Jeff, this is Clarence. If export coal didn\u2019t exist, what is going on with the yield on the domestic coal? Well, I don't think export coal has any direct impact at all on what the yield is on our domestic coal as it currently exists. Our yield is very positive on our domestic coal. It is -- actually it's improving in our domestic coal business that's coming along. The fixed variable contracts and the nature of them have been proved very positive to us. They cover a good percentage of our contracts now, especially in our Southern utility markets. There is coal that we are now moving and hauling that we would not have moved in haul have we not had the fixed variable contracts with the caps and obviously to help control how much that moves if that's right that we are handling now that we would not have handled. I don't know if that helps or not. Michael Ward : Let me try a little bit and so if we just look at our domestic portfolio Jeff, so if I had to say, in general are those rates heading up where the answer is yes. So on the two thirds it's not on its variable, those rates are moving up. On the one third that is fixed variable, the base there is a minimum and a maximum, that base is moving up of where they are in that range can have a fairly significant impact on overall RPU and coal. So all that has an upper bias, but the fixed variable make it confusing where they are in that scale that's allowed in the contract. Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham: That's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Scott. Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research : Hey thanks. Good morning, guys. I had a couple few things on coal, one Clarence, do you have a view on coal yield sequentially from 2Q to 3Q they were pretty flat those quarters, a view there. Do you think that's one? Next, do you think that the kind of that mid 30s export number for this year would you, you think that's a good bottom or do you think that can grow next year or do you see more risk to that and then just lastly, the seven million tons of coal that you guys have talked about that shutting next year? Is that number changing much this year meaning is that growing a lot with coal this year or is that not really seeing much movement? Clarence Gooden : Well, it's going to reverse, its four million tons not seven and we don't see that number changing. It appears to be what it is and we think the other plants that remain open will burn at higher burn rates and it will be a non-event number essentially for us. Number two was export rates for next year too early to tell. We'll revisit that in the fourth quarter\u2026 Michael Ward : As compared to volumes. Clarence Gooden : Volumes, it's still too early to tell. We'll know more about that in the fourth quarter and your first question was what on the\u2026 Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research : Just clear yields sequentially from second quarter to third quarter. Should we think that they stay flat, I don't know if you made any additional pricing adjustments on the export side? Clarence Gooden : Flat, you should expect them to be flat. Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research : Okay. Great. And then just one other question Clarence, it wasn\u2019t so clear to me that some of the questions on pricing earlier, are you starting to or thinking about and during somewhat like a de-marketing phase to push pricing a little bit more aggressively even if it means giving up a little bit of volume? Clarence Gooden : No, we're not de-marketing, but we are aggressively pricing our products. Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research : Okay. Great. Thanks for the time guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Jason Seidl from Cowen. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Jason. Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company: Good morning, guys. Real quickly, when you think about sort of the impacts of the service levels, obviously you talked about on the cost side, do you think you left any money on the table on the intermodal product in terms of your ability to take prices up, especially on the tighter curve market. Michael Ward : Well, I tell our team that we are always leaving money on the table. So I mean I don't know what you want me to say, yes. Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company: Okay. That's fair enough. And\u2026 Clarence Gooden : \u2026truck market changes, that we will respond to the marketplace. Michael Ward : Absolutely. Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company: Okay. That's what I want to hear. While I am thinking also about all the equipment that you are bringing on, obviously some of it's because service is down and some of it's because you are just getting more business. How much do you think you guys can start shedding in 2015 and assuming your service levels come back? Michael Ward : In terms of really the locomotives, I think you are referring to predominantly? Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company: Locomotives and even in terms of headcount, how should we start thinking about that because some of them seems like you're just trying to extend some people and put off their retirements a little bit. Fredrik Eliasson : On the locomotive side for some reason if there is no need for those locomotives, the network fluidity comes back. We do have a fair amount of leases that we can turn back. So that's part of the safety levers so to speak. If the demand profile is not as strong as we currently think it is. On the crews side, we're hiring, obviously for attrition, but also for growth and we always have the flexibility if we need to, to do for a little retention that something that we normally don't look at until unless that we think it's a longer more sustained more period of time that we don't need those crews because we do hire them and they are expensive too because you spend a fair amount of time and effort on them. So you don't want to do that unnecessarily but we do have that ability if we are incorrect in our forecast that the growth will continue. Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company: So Fredrik in terms of the total headcount for 2015, you would expect growth over 2014? Fredrik Eliasson : I think that based on the current volume assumptions that we have, that continues to be robust. I think the answer is yes, I don't think it's going to be significant because I think the operating leverage is going to be especially as we get the network fluidity back, I think there is an opportunity to see great leverage there. Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company: Well fantastic gentlemen, I appreciate the time as always. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Ben Hartford from Baird. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Ben. Ben Hartford \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Hey, good morning, guys. Fred, I just wanted to clarify the comments that you have made about the third quarter 2013 EPS, you had said that the number that you were referring to was $0.45 from a year ago, correct? Fredrik Eliasson : That's correct. Ben Hartford \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Okay. Good, and not to beat this pricing discussion, but I understand that you guys look at the spread between RCAF and price, but you are entering a bit of a unprecedented period with regard to pricing and the truck load rate growth contractual rate growth is accelerating and faster than what you guys are realizing within the merchandize and the intermodal product first time in at least a cycle. And is it incorrect to look at core contractual truck load rates as setting the tone for both the intermodal business and even some of the merchandize business when you do set and re-price and an annualized basis. So to the extent the truck load pricing growth continues to be above what you are seeing within those core segments, certainly above that 2.5% number that you saw this quarter that there can be upside or that you can't price to market you are not beholding to some sort of fixed spread internally between RCAF and what you feel like that the market can digest, correct? Fredrik Eliasson : That's correct Ben. I think it's absolutely the right way to look at. Ben Hartford \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Okay. Good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Cherilyn. Cherilyn Radbourne \u2013 TD Securities : Thanks very much and good morning. I am just going to ask one and that relates to international intermodal, which for me was probably the biggest surprise in terms of the volume performance for you and for the industry in the quarter because it's been pretty tepid for a while. So I just wondered if you could give some color on how much of the growth you think was catch-up from Q1, how much was a pull forward related to the labor contract expiry on the West Coast and how much you think was organic? Clarence Gooden : Cherilyn, this is Clarence. I think it's difficult to segment into those three areas, but I would tell you this. Our customers told us that they shipped earlier this year significantly earlier in anticipation of ILWU work stoppages on the West Coast. So all the ships out of Asia were fully profiled coming to the West Coast and via the canal in order to avoid that. So that certainly had an impact. There were some impact due to winter weather and we expect to see that international traffic in the low single digits going forward. Cherilyn Radbourne \u2013 TD Securities : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, Clarence. That's it for me. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Walter. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is [indiscernible] for Walter. I was just hoping to get some more color on the expansion of crude capabilities across your network. You saw some fairly strong growth and I was wondering where you see that business going forward and the timing of that coming online. Clarence Gooden : Where do we see crude expansions? Is that's your question? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Clarence Gooden : Well obviously there is expansions going all along the East Coast as we speak. They are predominantly in the Philadelphia area. Some are in the New Jersey areas where we are seeing the current expansions. We have two customers that are looking at expanding in New Jersey area rather than for obvious reason, so I won't mention their names, but that's where you are seeing the expansions occur. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then this is all coming on your network at what sort of volume opportunity do you see from these engines? Clarence Gooden : Well, right now we are averaging around for 2014 plus or minus 20 trains per week. We also could see some slight increase in that as we go forward. There is a finite capacity, number, both as you know from what the Bakken can produce and from what the refiners can consume. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thanks very much for your time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Justin Long from Stephens. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Justin. Justin Long - Stephens: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify one thing quickly. Could you talk about the congestion related cost that you are assuming in your guidance for the back half of the year? Are you assuming it may stay pretty consistent with what we saw in the second quarter? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, well we said as a fair remark was that until we see meaningful improvement in the network fluidity and velocity, it is reasonable to assume that that run rate of about $10 million or so a period of $30 million a quarter is the right place to think about it. Justin Long - Stephens: And you are not assuming that that fluidity improves until 2015? Fredrik Eliasson : No, I am not saying that. I am just saying right now from what we're seeing, we're seeing if it doesn\u2019t improve, it's the right place to be in terms of thinking about what the incremental cost will be. If we see meaningful improvement here during the summer months, which is a possibility that that demand is a little bit lower during the summer as we go through the period here until Labor Day, there is an opportunity that we can see meaningful improvement and the cost can come down, but that's yet to be seen. Justin Long - Stephens: Okay. Fair enough. That's helpful and as a second question, I was wondering if you could talk about what you are seeing in the intermodal pricing environment? Would you say that core pricing in intermodal is pretty close to that 2.6% average between merchandizing intermodal or is it a little bit more competitive and tracking below that level? Fredrik Eliasson : I think you'll see intermodal is a little bit more competitive and tracking a little lower than that level that's in there right now. Justin Long - Stephens: Okay. Great. I know it's been a long call. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. And our last question or comment comes from Cleo Zagrean from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning. Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital : Good morning and thank you. I have to follow-up on the prior question and some before it in terms of intermodal pricing? Can you help us with a little more detail on the split between door to door and what you would call your main business and the transfer price there and where do you see that going forward? Clarence Gooden : You were fading on me there. The intermodal pricing on the domestic door to door and where do we see that going? Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital : Why did the share of door to door within your -- with your entire intermodal business, how come that had a significant -- such a significant impact on price or if you break up what you would call core intermodal pricing trends versus door to door? Clarence Gooden : It's relatively small percent of door to door is of our overall pricing if that's what your question is. Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital : Okay. So therefore we can infer that intermodal pricing across businesses was relatively weak? In other words, the decline was broad based. Clarence Gooden : No, I wouldn\u2019t infer that at all. I would say that our intermodal pricing was somewhere in the range of around 2% little bit above that. Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital : Okay. The second question I had was in terms of the impact of business mix on margins as opposed to price, can you help us understand how mix you are playing to your aspiration to get continued strong incremental margins in that 50% range. Thank you. Clarence Gooden : Well, the margin mix continues in terms of favoring more intermodal, but because of the work that we've done over the last few years to improve the profitability of that business segment, it is now at par with the rest of our merchandize business. This quarter we saw an increase in some of our coal business, which is a welcome sign. So that's certainly helpful too and so as we think about the future and the guidance we have in place, I think we have the right mix thoughts there and I think we are in all our businesses profitable and we would like to grow all our business as much as we possibly can going forward. So we are somewhat indifferent to the mix that we are seeing. Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital : Thank you very much. Really appreciate it. Michael Ward : Well everyone, thank you for your attention. We'll see you next quarter. Operator This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect your line.",

Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the CSX Corporation Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode (Operator Instructions). For opening remarks and introduction I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations for CSX Corporation. David Baggs : Thank you, Wendy and good morning everyone. And again welcome to CSX Corporation\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we will review this morning, along with our quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements are available on our website at csx.com under the Investor section. In addition, following the presentation, a webcast and podcast replay will be available on the same website. Here representing CSX this morning are Michael Ward, the Company\u2019s Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Clarence Gooden, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; Oscar Munoz, Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the Company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the Company\u2019s disclosure in the accompanying presentation on Slide 2.  This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. With nearly 30 analysts covering CSX, I would ask, as a courtesy for everyone, to please limit your inquiries to one primary and one follow-up question. Now, before I turn the call over to Michael, I would like to remind all of you that today\u2019s call will be focused on the discussion of the Company\u2019s strong third quarter results. As a longstanding policy here at CSX we do not comment on rumors or market speculation, and we will not address questions that do not pertain to our quarterly results. We appreciate your cooperation.  And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael? Michael J. Ward: Well, thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Last evening, CSX reported record third quarter earnings per share of $0.51, up 13% increase from the $0.45 in the same period last year. CSX also generated record third quarter revenue of $3.2 billion, up 8% on a 7% volume increase.  These results demonstrate CSX\u2019s ability to capitalize on the continued economic momentum that is driving broad-based growth across nearly all markets, coupled with the secular growth trends in intermodal and the gas and oil markets. Even with the high level of demand CSX\u2019s operations have remained stable. We are continuing to work with our customers to meet their current and future needs, by adding crews, investing in locomotives and infrastructure to increase capacity.  Thanks for those efforts, the company increased operating income by 16% to $976 million this quarter and improved its operating ratio by 240 basis points to 69.7%. CSX continues to see growth potential across the markets. We are confident in our ability to continue to generate substantial value for our shareholders. Now, I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Clarence, who will take us through the top line results in more detail, Clarence? Clarence W. Gooden: Thank you, Michael, and good morning. The underlying macro-economy remains strong and the data and our experience suggest a positive outlook for growth. The Purchasing Managers Index came in at 57 in September; a reading above 50 indicates that the manufacturing economy is expanding.  This is the 16th consecutive month the PMI index has signaled expansion. At the same time, the Customer Inventories Index declined to 45; a reading below 50 indicates customer\u2019s inventories are low and suggests continued strength in the demand for manufacturing output. As a result, many of the customers we serve grew at a robust pace and most of the key indicators we track point to continued expansion.  Now let\u2019s look at the results on the next slide. Starting at the left side of the chart, total volume grew 7% to more than 1.75 million loads in the quarter with strong growth in merchandise, intermodal and coal.  Moving to the right, total revenue increased $236 million to over $3.2 billion in the quarter, reflecting overall volume growth and increased pricing across most markets. Merchandise and intermodal account for over three quarters of CSX\u2019s overall revenue. Total revenue includes $17 million of liquidated damages related to contract shortfalls in coal shipments which compares to $51 million in the third quarter of last year. Next, the average revenue per unit was up slightly. Here core pricing gains and our merchandised and intermodal markets offset the impact of mix and lower coal revenue per unit. Finally, let\u2019s move to core pricing. Recall the same-store sales are defined as shipments with the same customer, commodity, and car type, and the same origin and destination. These shipments represented about 75% of CSX\u2019s traffic base for the quarter.  On this basis, all-in pricing was a positive 0.2% in the quarter, reflecting continued rate pressure and export coal markets and the impact of fixed, variable contracts in the domestic utility market where volumes are now increasing. Since the pricing environment for coal has become more dynamic, reflecting global market conditions for exports and our fixed variable contract structure for domestic utilities and since our merchandise in intermodal markets are becoming a larger portion of our business, we have again provided you with the same-store sales pricing for these two markets on a combined basis.  At the bottom of this panel, you can see pricing for merchandise and intermodal averaged 2.5% for the quarter. This pricing gain is smaller on a year-over-year basis and essentially flat sequentially while still representing a small spread over rail inflation. That said we remain confident that the value we create for our customers combined with increasing demand for our service product, provides a solid foundation for growth and sustained pricing of both rail inflation. Now let\u2019s look at the individual markets in more detail, starting with merchandise. Overall merchandise revenue increased 12% to more than $1.9 billion in the quarter. Volume in the agricultural sector was up 7%. Feed grain shipments continued to benefit from the strong 2013 harvest and ethanol shipments grew as lower corn prices resulted in higher ethanol production levels. The construction sector grew 5% overall reflecting the ongoing recovery of housing and construction activity. Finally, the industrial sector grew 13% led by strength in the energy-related commodities including crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas, and frac sand. Moving to the next page, let\u2019s review the intermodal business. Intermodal revenue increased 6% to more than $450 million. Total volume grew 5%, setting a new quarterly record for intermodal. Domestic volume was up 7%, driven by continued highway to rail conversions and international volume was up 3%, reflecting an economy that continues to expand. Total intermodal revenue per unit was flat as continued core pricing gains and higher fuel recoveries were offset by mix changes. Finally, we continue to grow our international business by adding new service offerings and making strategic investments. We anticipate opening our new terminal outside of Montreal and completing expansion of our Northwest Ohio hub late in the fourth quarter. Moving to the next page, let\u2019s review the coal business. Coal volume increased 7%, while revenue was essentially flat in the quarter at $721 million. Domestic coal volume increased 14% with growth in both northern and southern utility shipments, reflecting higher natural gas prices, replenishing of stockpiles, and a competitive gain. Export coal tonnage declined 13% as global market conditions for both thermal and metallurgical coals remain solid. The current API2 spot price of about $72 per ton remains well below the $80, the price level where U.S. coals are more competitive. The Quinton metallurgical coal benchmark has also remained at low levels with a rate of about $120 per ton in the third quarter. Finally, total revenue per unit was down 6% with lower export pricing, fixed variable utility contracts, and unfavorable domestic mix negatively impacting revenue per unit. Now let me wrap up with the outlook for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we expect that positive demand environment in the fourth quarter with stable to favorable conditions for 96% of our markets and unfavorable conditions for the remaining 4%. Looking at some of the key markets; chemicals is favorable as we continue to capture opportunities created by the expanding domestic oil and gas industries. In metals, we saw production increase in the third quarter and we expect this trend to continue with demand in the automotive and energy markets being the key drivers. Strong intermodal growth will continue as our strategic network investments support highway to rail conversions. We expect strong domestic coal volume growth in the fourth quarter as utilities continue to rebuild inventories. Forest products is neutral as continued strength in building products is expected to be offset by lower shipments of wood pellets. Automotive is neutral as slight growth in North American light vehicle production continues to be offset by modal conversions that occurred earlier this year. Export coal volume is expected to be significantly lower in the fourth quarter and our best estimate of 2014 volume is now in the mid to high 30 million ton range. Overall, we expect high levels of demand for our service will continue in the fourth quarter. Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Oscar to review our operating results. Oscar X. Munoz: Thank you, sir. Good morning everyone. Let me start with a review of our safety as it is our first and foremost priority. In the third quarter, the personal injury and train accident rates both increased versus last year\u2019s near record lows. While we\u2019re disappointed that the metrics have ticked up slightly this quarter, we remain focused on continuous improvement in safety. We remain a leader in the nation\u2019s safest industry and we\u2019re committed to both community and employee safety. Let\u2019s turn over to the service performance on the next slide. As you can see on the left, third quarter on-time originations and arrivals, along with velocity and dwell, were all stable sequentially. While CSX\u2019s overall service performance is still below the level of our customers and we have come to expect demand on our network has remained strong. As you can see on the chart on the right, service levels have remained steady since the end of the first quarter and have continued to support volume growth. And as importantly, our cost of service is improving. We are working with our customers to meet their rapidly increased demand levels, but as you know, resources in the rail industry take time to be put in place. In that regard, let me discuss the framework on the next page which we\u2019ve been sharing with our customer to keep them updated on our service recovery efforts. Now, while elementary, the chart on Page 15 conveys the four primary service components, all of which are highly interrelated. We tell our customers there\u2019s a need to ensure not only that we have the right level of train crews but the necessary infrastructure and appropriate number of locomotives with a process that anticipates and reacts to changing business conditions. Let me briefly touch on each of the four areas depicted on the chart, starting with trained crews. We have hired about 1,250 T&E employees this year for a net increase of over 300 crews and revenue service this year. We currently have 900 crews in training and expect to have over 1,300 by year-end. Hiring crews, as you know, takes six to nine months to find the right individuals and train them. I\u2019m happy to report that given the hiring we\u2019re doing we\u2019re well on our way to having the train crews we need to support both recovery and future growth. Turning to infrastructure, this is the longest lead time area there is in the rail space. In addition to the actual construction, new projects can take years of planning and getting the necessary approvals from local, state and federal officials. The good news is that we have finished several projects and have many more underway to help improve network fluidity in Chicago as well as our water level and river line routes in the northern tier. Additionally, we\u2019ve been steadily increasing our intermodal investment such as the expansion of our Northwest Ohio intermodal terminal which is nearly complete. Next, and as you can see on the bottom of the chart, the locomotive icon is colored red. While we have added over 400 active units on a year-over-year basis, unfortunately the unanticipated rapid volume growth that we\u2019re experiencing has exceeded the current capabilities of our locomotive fleet and is a major cause of our service challenges, earlier this quarter we signed an agreement to purchase 300 new locomotives over the next few years with deliveries beginning early next year in 2015. This combined with our own heavy repair program will generate the locomotives we need to enable recovery and again support future growth. Now because these units will not be arriving until after the first of the year, we anticipate locomotives will continue to be a challenge for CSX into next year. Lastly, let me focus on the process bubble for a moment. This is the area most in our control with the fastest cycle time. We\u2019re actively working to improve planning with other railroads, especially in the critical Chicago Gateway. We are nearly complete with our winter preparations and, also very importantly, we\u2019ve been holding ongoing dialogue with our customers to keep them up-to-date on our service recovery progress in order to better meet their continued volume growth. Now wrapping up on the next slide. While the service is critical, our team understands that safe operation is still job number one. This team remains committed to safety and service and I greatly thank them for it, and I\u2019m proud to be part of it. The network performance remains stable and we\u2019ll continue working on maintaining the delicate balance of meeting increased customer demand and service recovery. While costs are temporarily higher as we work through our service issues, they have improved sequentially and we expect them to return to normal as fluidity is restored. Lastly, we remain highly confident that our dedicated operating team will gradually restore service to the levels our customers have come to expect from CSX. So with that, let me turn it over to Fred for his review of the financials. Fredrik Eliasson : Well, thank you, Oscar, and good morning everyone. Let me begin by providing a summary of our third quarter results. As Clarence mentioned, revenue increased 8% versus the prior year on 7% higher volume, driven by broad-based strength across our merchandise, intermodal and coal markets. Expenses increased 5% versus last year, driven primarily by higher volume, which I will discuss in more detail in the coming slides. Operating income was $976 million, up 16% or $136 million versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense was relatively flat to the prior year, at $137 million.  In addition, other income declined $31 million versus the prior year on two unique items. First, following our recent $1 billion debt offering we used some of the proceeds for early retirement of existing debt for which we incurred an additional expense. Redeeming the debt early, generated a positive value of holding the proceeds in cash.  Second, we also incurred some environmental cleanup costs, during the third quarter related to a non-operating site. Income taxes were $304 million in the quarter for an effective tax rate of 37.4%. Overall, net earnings were $509 million and EPS was $0.51 per share, up 12% and 13% respectively versus the prior year period.  With that, let\u2019s turn to the next slide and briefly discuss how fuel lag impacted the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the effect of the lag in our fuel surcharge program was favorable by $14 million. This reflects $8 million of positive in-quarter lag during the third quarter of 2014 versus $6 million of negative in-quarter lag for the same period in the prior year. Based on the current forward curve, we expect the year-over-year fuel lag impact to be slightly favorable in the fourth quarter.  Turning to the next slide, let\u2019s review our expenses. Overall expenses increased 5% in the quarter. I will talk about the top three expense items in more detail on the next slide, but let me first briefly speak to the bottom two on this chart. Depreciation was up 5% to $291 million, due to a higher net asset base. Going forward, we are reviewing an asset light study that we normally conduct at this point in the year. Absent any changes, we continue to expect depreciation to increase sequentially a few million dollars per quarter, reflecting the ongoing investment in our business. Equipment rent was 13% up to $106 million driven by higher freight car rate, incremental volume and longer car cycles.  Now turning to the next slide, let\u2019s discuss our other expenses. Before I discuss the details of these expense categories, let me first highlight the shift between our labor and MS&O lines. During the third quarter, CSX fully in-sourced the management of its locomotive maintenance force. As a result of this change, labor and fringe expense increased by $15 million and MS&O expense decreased by the same amount.  So overall the change was expense neutral in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect this trend to continue given the long-term nature of this agreement and future quarter results should reflect this new baseline for labor, fringe and MS&O expense. Now let me discuss the main drivers for each of expense categories beginning on the left with labor and fringe. Total labor and fringe increased 7% or $54 million versus last year. Excluding the in-sourcing impact labor and fringe increased $39 million year-over-year of which $25 million was related to incremental volume and $18 million was inflation.  Looking at efficiency and other labor productivity from volume absorption was offset by incremental over time and relief crew expense, as we continue to incur some incremental costs related to network performance. However, these labor-related costs declined sequentially from the second quarter. In terms of fourth quarter expectations we expected similar level of labor inflation in the $15 million to $20 million range as well as higher year-over-year expenses related to volume growth. Our ending third quarter headcount was up 1% versus the end of the second quarter as T&E employees increased to accommodate higher volume. Looking ahead, we expect overall headcount to increase an additional 1% or about 350 employees by the end of the year versus our September level. Moving to the right on the slide, MS&O expense increased 6% or $34 million versus the last year, which includes $23 million of expense related to incremental volume and $10 million of inflation. In addition, there was a $16 million increase in casualty and other MS&O with the majority related to the resolution of claims from prior years. And of course, you can see the in-sourcing impact on MS&O that I mentioned earlier. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter we continue to expect higher year-over-year MS&O expense related to inflation and volume growth. Finally, expense \u2013 fuel expense declined 3% or $14 million versus last year as the impact of higher volume was mostly offset by favorable price and efficiency. In addition, we cycled an adjustment to an interline fuel receivable from the prior year which drove most of the favorability in the other category. That concludes the expense review. Turning to the next slide I\u2019d like to highlight our core earnings growth and incremental operating margin. Looking at the third quarter financial results and excluding the $34 million in lower liquidity damages that we recycling from the prior year. The company generated $217 million of revenue growth that was partially offset by $100 million of incremental expense. This netted to an increase in core operating income of $170 million versus the prior year or an incremental operating margin of 63%.  As we highlighted last quarter, the core earnings strength of CSX\u2019s business is again more evident and this quarter\u2019s results again underscores our positive outlook for the future. Now let me wrap up on the next slide. First, we continue to see broad-based strength across a diverse business portfolio and that strength is translating into more visible and more meaningful earnings improvement. As Oscar highlighted, to effectively serve this growth we are executing our resource plan and investing in infrastructure, locomotives and crews to return service to the superior levels that our customers expect. Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect EPS will grow at a rate roughly similar to the reported EPS growth we saw here in the third quarter. Of course, this assumes operations remain stable and volume growth remain strong, albeit at a lower level than we saw in the third quarter recognizing that we\u2019re not cycling the strong harvest from last year. For the full year, we continue to expect modest earnings growth. As we look ahead, CSX still expects to achieve double-digit EPS growth in 2015 and an operating ratio in the mid-60s longer term. With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks. Michael J. Ward:  Well, thank you, Fredrik. Over the past few years, CSX has overcome the challenge of an energy transition in America, absorbing a loss of nearly $1 billion in coal revenue and leveraging new opportunities to sustain earnings growth. CSX has emerged from this transition as stronger company. That strength was evident again this morning as CSX delivered record third quarter earnings for its shareholders and stable service for its customers, while reaffirming the company\u2019s bright future. That future is built on the continued execution of CSX\u2019s core strategy. That means enhancing our ability to grow faster than the economy, price above inflation, make strategic investments and produce ever more efficient operations to continue delivering superior shareholder value. That is what you saw drive our performance in the most recent quarter and we expect that strategy to drive our growth going forward. In short, we remain confidence CSX will continue to deliver compelling customer value, which directly translates into superior value for you, our shareholders. Now, we\u2019ll be glad to take your questions. Operator :  Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Michael J. Ward:  Good morning, Allison. Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about crude prices spiraling downward. And maybe how worried are you about this given that a lot of your recent growth has hinged on energy markets. So I was just wondering if you could maybe help us frame the risk here. Clarence W. Gooden: Allison, this is Clarence Gooden. Obviously, we have our eye on it with the crude prices this morning approaching $80 on West Texas\u2019 Intermediate. But in the near-term we don\u2019t see any impact on our crude business at this point in time. We\u2019ll watch those prices as they test the ceilings of what the Bakken crude is, but we don\u2019t see any near-term impact on that at this time. We think it\u2019s sustainable. Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. And is that view sort of similar for frac and NGLs that you are moving? Clarence W. Gooden: Yes we see the same for that, yes. Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Clarence W. Gooden: Good morning, Rob. Robert Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Hey, good morning guys. Clarence, as a follow-up to Allison\u2019s question, you\u2019ve done a really good job of kind of framing the export coal outlook predicated upon how the prices move. Are there certain price thresholds that we should be thinking about for the crude by rail where it comes more challenging based off of kind of what you see? And I realize there is more moving parts given there is net backs involved. But I would be curious to get your thoughts around that as well as any early comments you might have about the export coal outlook for 2015. Clarence W. Gooden: Well, let me take your second question first. It\u2019s really too soon for us to give you any commentary on the export coal for 2015, but we\u2019ll certainly do that on our fourth quarter call. On your first question, I\u2019m certainly not an expert on crude spreads here. I did see a discussion this morning, however, by the former President and CEO of Shell Oil, in which he said he thought it was very interesting that the OPEC countries may in fact be \u2013 one of the reasons they\u2019re bringing down the price of oil is to test to see where American fracking companies would in fact start to shut down wells. Since nobody knew what that number was, it was a closely guarded secret. So your guess is as good as mine when those would start coming in, but there\u2019d obviously be some number, but it\u2019s, to my knowledge we\u2019re nowhere near close to what that number is. Robert Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Fair enough. Appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Clarence W. Gooden: Good morning, Thomas. Thomas Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs :  Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the time here. I just wanted to ask on the intermodal side. First off, can you give us a little bit of color in terms of where your domestic intermodal rates are versus TL presently? Clarence W. Gooden: They\u2019re running in general on the contractual side about 10% to 15% below where the truck load rates are. The spot market, however, is much closer to what the truckload rates are. We\u2019ve been able to close that spot market in the \u2013 due to the tightening up of the truckload demand. So we\u2019re probably within 5% of those. Thomas Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, great. And then just with regard to the comment on the mix shift, can you help us understand what exactly it is? Because when we look at the mix between domestic and international, they are actually \u2013 the shift has been only about 1 point year-on-year. So I am wondering if there is more in mix and commodity or is there a mix between increase in long-term customer versus spot. Just if you could maybe give us a little bit more color with regard to that. And then just I guess also related, is there any reason why the domestic intermodal hasn\u2019t \u2013 the share hasn\u2019t grown more significantly just given that there has been more growth that we would have thought over the last year with regards to domestic over international? Clarence W. Gooden: Well in our door-to-door service product, which has traditionally carried a higher RPU was roughly flat this quarter. And in addition, we saw pretty strong growth in what we\u2019re traditionally backhaul lane markets and that has had a negative impact. For example, our UMAX product, which moves from the East to points beyond Chicago, which are traditionally back haul flows, has had a healthy volume growth even though it has had an RPU growth of around 3.5% that volume has still had a negative impact on the mix. And the rest of the intermodal businesses as you know is managed on long-term contracts, it has and has price escalators built in. So it is difficult for us to in the short term to get some of those rates up. Thomas Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs : All right, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Michael J. Ward: Hi, Bill. William J. Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Hi, good morning. Fredrik, I wanted to ask you for a little bit more color on the 2015 commentary. I think we\u2019ve all been surprised at the volume growth so far in 2014. And so can you talk a little bit about the confidence on that double-digit growth rate? Does it suggest that the pricing outlook is superior and therefore incrementals should look better? Is that kind of the key to getting to double digit? Because I would assume volume growth would slow just given the comps. But maybe you can offer some views there. Fredrik J. Eliasson: Well I mean as I think we said in our prepared remarks, in the fourth quarter we already expect volumes to come down slightly from what we seen here over the last few quarters, but we still expect a pretty robust macro environment next year and that coupled with some of these more secular things that we\u2019re seeing in the energy environment and our intermodal trends continue to point towards a pretty healthy volume environment for 2015 as well. Clearly, as Clarence has mentioned a little early right now to talk about what export coal is going to do, but that is the wild card. We\u2019ve said that repeatedly and there is probably more downside than upside. But we continue to produce pretty good results, we continue to bring a fair amount to the bottom line even though we\u2019re not operating as efficiently as we can. So the fact that we are going to cycle some pretty significant headwinds we had here this year in the first quarter and even in the second quarter coupled with a good, healthy top line environment gives us the confidence that we should be able to produce double-digit earnings growth next year. Oscar X. Munoz: And Bill, this is Oscar. The cost structure part, that is mine, we got that one. That\u2019s going to be a key focus for us next year, and I think that will be a contributor factor. William J. Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  Yeah, that makes sense. Oscar, in the third quarter \u2013 I think in the first half we talked about a little over $120 million of weather and inefficiencies due to the network challenges. Was there an impact that you can give us for the third quarter how much that might have cost? Oscar X. Munoz: Sure. So you\u2019re right. It was about $32 million in the second quarter we estimated about $16 million here in the third quarter, the difference was predominantly that we had less reliance on foreign horsepower here in the third quarter than we had in the second quarter as we\u2019ve been able to ramp up additional leases and other repairs that we\u2019ve been doing on our equipment. Over time it\u2019s still running relatively high. But the big delta between the second and third quarter was just that, it was the locomotive costs. William J. Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  And you said, one, six. Oscar X. Munoz: 16, yes. William J. Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Yeah. Okay. Thank you for the time. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Michael Ward :  Good morning Ken. Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Great bottom-line performance, great to see. Can you maybe, Oscar, address \u2013 the on-time origination and arrivals continue to remain so low and we can see the velocity improving. But why are those measures and metrics stuck at kind of really reduced levels compared to the 85%, 90% we\u2019ve seen in the past. And what needs to turn? Is that just the employees and locos coming online or what else needs to happen to get the actual rails running on time? Oscar X. Munoz: Yeah, Ken, great question. Yeah, I think the public measures have always been and will continue to be sort of trailing indicators. I think getting back up to the pre-service recovery levels is going to take locomotives primarily. I think we\u2019ve got a lot of the crews, but we need 100 or 200 more locomotives here over the next few months that would take us back to those 85%, 90% level, that\u2019s the biggest factor. That\u2019s why on that service framework again \u2013 it takes all of those things being interrelated, but for us the red icon is power at this time. Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch : And then we can presume there is no issues with one manufacturer making them or with the new Tier 4 or anything else in terms of getting those locos? Oscar X. Munoz: : Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch : All right. And just a follow-up on the peer pricing. Is there, Clarence, any thoughts on the decelerating peer pricing? Given demand is so strong why we continue to see the peer pricing metric fall. It\u2019s half a point, but just why we see that downtick? Clarence W. Gooden: Ken, that was mainly in one of our market areas. I think you\u2019re going to see very robust pricing going forward. We are concentrated and focused on our pricing. So in regards to the question that Bill Greene asked earlier, pricing, you\u2019ll see going forward being very strong and very robust for us. Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch : All right, I appreciate the time. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Clarence W. Gooden: Good morning, Chris. Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citi Investment Research : Hey, good morning. Thanks. Maybe a question on the utility coal side; just curious sort of how that restocking is playing out. Just wanted to get a rough sense of sort of how your utilities that you serve are, in terms of historical inventories or inventories relative to historical levels. Are we getting closer? How much longer do you think this plays out? Clarence W. Gooden:  The North, Chris, is almost at their target levels. In fact, you could say they\u2019re at target levels. The South is still building and by the fourth quarter should be at target levels. Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citi Investment Research : Okay. So it feels like there is about one more quarter or so to get prepped, and then we\u2018ll see what the winter brings us. Clarence W. Gooden:  That\u2019s right. Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citi Investment Research : Okay. And then my second question, just a little bit of a bigger picture stepping back and thinking about the 65% OR target. As you stand with it now and the market as it stands today, could you give us some sense of sort of what you need to see happen to get toward that target, move towards that target? You made great strides on OR in the third quarter. Just want to get a rough sense of sort of how to think about sort of the puts and takes towards getting to that 65%, and maybe a little bit of color sort of when that could potentially happen. Fredrik Eliasson :  Sure. So obviously this is \u2013 we\u2019ve put together two quarters now in a row below 70%. And we have said we want to move to the 65% is kind of the target that we have out there. And clearly the foundation for that is service excellence. We need to restore service to the level that we expect from ourselves and the customers expect from us. And as we do that, we think three good things will happen and we\u2019ve seen that in the past, which is that we continue to price above inflation, and we see that the market is tightening up and we see opportunities to accelerate our pricing. Two, we continue to see a robust economic environment and we see now the positives of the new energy environment that should allow us to grow faster than the economy as a whole. And then as we get our network velocity up to the level we expect, we should also see cost coming out of the system again. Between those three, which are really the levers we\u2019ve been pulling for an extended period of time, we see the math is pretty compelling. It gets you there over time. But over the last two years, as you\u2019ve seen, with $800 million from coal coming out in terms of our top line, we have stood still for a period of time, as we now transition out of that period. We feel the momentum is coming back again, as we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re heading now. Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citi Investment Research : So natural progression over the next couple years, I guess? Michael J. Ward: Yes. Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citi Investment Research : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Michael J. Ward: Good morning, Tom. Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 UBS Investment Research : Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask Clarence a little bit about how much visibility you have to pricing at this point. I would think that with some of the multiyear contracts that would be expiring next year, you probably would have been in negotiations at this point. Maybe you have some of those deals signed already. So can you give us a flavor of what you are seeing for pricing for 2015, just in terms of either the multiyear contracts or other business? And perhaps also what \u2013 how much has already been repriced for 2015? Clarence W. Gooden:  We are well along in our pricing for 2015. I would tell you that in excess of 50% of our contracts that we have to renew for 2015 have been repriced. It\u2019s looking very good. That is why I made the statement earlier that prices were going up for 2015. I felt very positive about what 2015\u2019s pricing is looking like, it will be much more robust than you\u2019ve seen probably in the last three to four years for CSX. Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 UBS Investment Research : So when we think about that \u2013 what more robust means, does that mean a percentage point higher? Does that mean more than that? Could it be 2 or 3 percentage points higher than the pricing you have seen in the last couple years? Clarence W. Gooden: It means significantly improved. Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 UBS Investment Research : Okay. Michael J. Ward: Welcome back Tom. Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 UBS Investment Research : I don\u2019t know if that counts as my second or not. I will try to \u2013 Oscar, do you have a quick thought on the timing of the locomotives coming up? You said 300 I think is for multiple years. You need 100 to 200 more, but when do you get 100 to 200 more? Is that first half next year or? Oscar X. Munoz: Yeah, thanks. So yes, the early part of next year, we\u2019ll get 100 new. Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 UBS Investment Research : Okay. Oscar X. Munoz: And then, we are hoping for early delivery of a couple hundred of a \u2013 of the second hundred later in the year. But we also have our internal what we call heavy repair process that should deliver roughly between 100 and 150 over that same between now and the middle part of next year. So we\u2019ve another outlet just other than the purchases. It is just timing. Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 UBS Investment Research : Okay. That\u2019s great. I appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Michael J. Ward: Good morning, Cherilyn. Cherilyn Radbourne \u2013 TD Securities. : Thanks very much. Good morning. My question relates to Chicago. It is my understanding the rails have agreed to a series of protocols that will be triggered automatically if certain thresholds are tripped this winter. And I was just wondering if you could give us a bit of color on how that will work and how you think it will improve the industry\u2019s recoverability? Oscar X. Munoz: Yes, Cherilyn, this is Oscar. Yes, certainly there is a broader set of issues and a very complex environment, right, kind of a spider network, six Class I\u2019s, heavy commuter and passenger rail on the plays, so those require a lot of coordination. What is called the CTCO, which is in essence the terminal operating team that is represented by most of the railroads, it has been a coordinating factor there and has done a pretty good job. Remember we forget that Chicago just got slammed with a huge amount of volume which has created a little bit attention. So knowing that, knowing that another winter is coming and that heavy volumes continue, we have been working across most of the industry to sort of get CTCO to act more like a single terminal. We\u2019re going to 24/7 operations during the period. A lot more engagement between all levels and most of the railroads again and then importantly to your question, improve the informational planning tools because for a while there was kind of word of mouth. I called you and said I was in trouble and then you tried to fix it. Or you didn\u2019t see that problem. And so rather than taking the human aspect of that, let\u2019s put it in a system, put it in a scorecard, if you will, and then that will drive what we call an alert status that will increase the level of interaction and coordination. So it\u2019s a combination of people, communicating more, using tools to get facts and data so that we are not guessing. And then really there is kind of a great level of trust, desire, and capability for everyone to work together there. So it is a broad, complex environment and we are focused on getting that done for the next few months. Cherilyn Radbourne \u2013 TD Securities. : That\u2019s great and that\u2019s all from me. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein. Michael J. Ward: Good morning, David. David S. Vernon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, Fredrik, as you think about the incremental margin performance going forward, what do you think is the right sort of range we should be looking at into 2015? It seems like the volume driven leverage is having a good effect, and if Clarence is right you\u2019re going to get more pricing. Should we be actually expecting the incremental margin performance to step up next year? Fredrick J. Eliasson: We\u2019ve said that in order to get to our mid-60s target, that we need to have incremental margins above 50% this quarter depending on how you look at it, somewhere between 50% to 60%. And I think that is a good place to be as. . As you think about 15% specifically, you\u2019re right, we\u2019re going to have I think an improved pricing environment, but you\u2019re also going to have a period of time, where we are going to have to essentially over resource slightly in order to get the velocity of our network up and running. So there are some puts and takes there, but you clearly have to be in the 50% to 60% range long-term in order to get to the place where we need to get to. David S. Vernon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: And then maybe just as a follow-up, Michael, we are talking a lot about the tightness of the rail infrastructure. And I would love to get your perspective on an industry issue which would be not specific to any type of specific deal. But do you think that consolidation across the larger Class I\u2019s could actually improve the capacity in the network in a way that would not be achievable without further consolidation, or do think that that it is less of a reality going forward? Michael J. Ward: I think what we see out there, David, is that all the railroads are increasing their capacity similar to what we are doing. And I think those will produce the capacity needed to move America\u2019s freight. David S. Vernon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: So you don\u2019t \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t see an extra step up in efficiency through consolidation across some of the Class I\u2019s? Michael J. Ward: You might actually see a step back. As you know, in the past mergers there have been severe service disruptions after one of those transactions. David S. Vernon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC:  Great. Thanks very much for the commentary. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the John Larkin with Stifel, Nicolaus. John G. Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc: Hi good morning gentlemen, thanks for taking my question. Clarence W. Gooden: Good morning John. John G. Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc: Just wanted to bore in a little bit more deeply on the $16 million that was the cited cost of the congestion in the third quarter for the Company, quite a bit down from where it was in the second quarter. But that strikes me as being a relatively low number given the extent and far-reaching nature of the congestion. So as you resource up by adding more people, add all these locomotives and so forth, presumably that\u2019s going to cost more on the other hand than the cost of congestion is costing you presently. Is that going to provide a little bit of a margin headwind over the next say two to four quarters as you go forward? Fredrik Eliasson : I think you are pulling on one of the reasons why we are not putting that explicit number into our earnings report at this point because the calculation itself becomes more complicated as you start to ramp up additional hiring and so forth. But if you look at where were again in the third quarter while we\u2019ve had some additional people in training the big driver really was the difference in terms of how we\u2019ve sourced our locomotives for the quarter. And so it has come down because it is a lot cheaper to get our leases, the use leased locomotives versus the foreign horsepower. And as you think about the next couple of quarters, to your point, there will be incremental cost that will come in as we bring on additional locomotives, as we bring on additional maintenance for those and additional hiring that we are doing. So I think that\u2019s a fair point. Michael J. Ward: But then again, all those resources, again remember, investment equals better service and service equals better volume and margins. And that is the reason why we do all this. And I think other than just bringing on equipment our process, we are spending a little bit better. Again, the indicators you see out there are trailing and you will be to see more of the financial, better financial impact here over the next couple of quarters. John G. Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc:  Thank you for the answer. Just maybe as a follow-on. A while ago you shifted to the fixed and variable cost pricing approach for utility coal contracts, volume has spiked as utilities have scrambled to sort of replenish their inventories and stockpiles. Has the fixed and variable pricing model worked the way you thought it would? And was one of the reasons why you\u2019re able to pick up a little competitive market share that you touched on just briefly during your formal comments? Clarence W. Gooden: John, this is Clarence. One, it has worked the way we expected it to work. And two, it is not the reason we made a competitive pick up. John G. Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.:  Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Michael J. Ward:  Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations. Two questions, one financial and then one a follow-up to the system fluidity question. Fredrik, how have these changes in investments affected your capital budget thoughts for 2014 and 2015? And can you address the drag on operating cash flow from the reversal of bonus depreciation? How much is that weighing on operating cash flow and will that change as we get into 2015? Fredrik Eliasson :  Sure. In terms of capital, I think we have a better idea in the fourth quarter, but clearly because of the locomotives we\u2019re going to be purchasing next year. We\u2019re probably looking at the higher end of the 16% to 17%, probably around 17% realistically. In terms of the cash flow, just ask me that question again? Jeffrey Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research : Well, a bonus depreciation reversed and that\u2019s been a drag, I thought, of about $200 million to $300 million on operating cash flow. And I was just wondering if we\u2019re going to start to mitigate that in the next year or two and what that drag is likely to be. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure. So next year I think will be the height of that drag. We\u2019ve started seeing a little bit here in this year, but next year essentially our cash taxes will be almost at the statutory rate, so 36%, 37%. There won\u2019t be many opportunities to defer taxes next year because of the fact that we\u2019ve enjoyed that bonus depreciation for so many years. But as you move into 2016, you will start building up some of that depreciable base again. Now all of this assumes that bonus depreciation will not be extended, which there is still some talk about. But right now it looks like about $250 million or so, $250 million of impact on our cash flow year-over-year just from the fact that bonus depreciation is going away in 2015. Michael J. Ward:  This is Michael. I\u2019d just add. When I go to DC, I think the general sentiment is they probably will do the tax extenders before the end of the year. Jeffrey Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research : Okay. And then, Mike, a thought question. A lot of people that invest in the stock today weren\u2019t around in the 1990s when we had the service issues and that led to the STB\u2019s merger moratorium and then the new rules. I heard your answer to the earlier question that consolidation would probably muck up the system. But in terms of the concept of consolidation there was a reason the STB made it tougher. Do you think in this environment when service across the industry is struggling that the argument can be made that service would be better as a result of consolidation? Or that any large consolidation could even be likely in this environment? Michael J Ward :  Well, I think all this is very speculative, but as you know, the STB is very concerned about the service levels being produced by the industry with this surge of business. And it even asked for new reports on a weekly basis to monitor that. So I might speculate they would be very cautious about this because in the past they have created disruptions and the industry is already somewhat slowdown by this tremendous growth in the volumes. Jeffrey Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research :  So you would argue that the regulators would be very skeptical in this environment anyway? Michael J Ward :  That would be my speculation, but you\u2019d probably be better to ask them. Jeffrey Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research : : Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Michael J Ward : Good morning, Scott. Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research : Hey, good morning, guys. Fredrik, if we take out the liquidated damages this quarter and a year ago, you still saw a pretty big increase in other railway revenue. Can you give us some color on what that was and if that is sustainable or not, how we should model that going forward? Fredrik J. Eliasson: Yes. If you look at where we are on other revenue, I think there is couple other drivers if you look at a year-over-year clearly, we are seeing a little bit of higher incidental revenue predominantly in intermodal, because of the tight capacity environment that we find ourselves in we see some of the subsidiary railroads have done a little bit better, than they did a year-ago. And then last year was a little bit depressed because of some of the revenue adjustments that we had, so, that kind of explain it. So I would say that this quarter was a pretty good run rate. I think historically I have said $80 million to $90 million is probably a good place to be, we were slightly above that here this quarter. But somewhere around $80 million to $90 million is probably a good place to be in other revenue, excluding any liquidated damages. Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research : That is great. And then the guidance for next year, if I remember when you first laid it out for us there was this assumption that coal would stabilize. And now you don\u2019t add that caveat as much about coal stabilizing. So do you think you need coal to be flat next year? Or is there enough going on in pricing and merchandise growth where you can still get to the double-digit earnings growth next year even if coal gets worse next year? Fredrik J. Eliasson: I think we\u2019re trying to stay away from any specific market and try to predict what it will do, because as we try to do that in the past, we found ourselves that we usually are wrong, either good or bad for that matter. And so, we try to stay at a high level. As we look at next year, we still feel that double-digit is the right place to be. But clearly there are lots of pluses and minuses. We got the fact that the macro environment, as I said earlier, is positive. We\u2019ve got a tightening capacity environment that should be helpful in the pricing side. But then you do have export coal and you do have the fact that we need to see the cost coming out of the system as short-term over resource but then see the cost coming out. And then the thing that you don\u2019t know what is going to happen is obviously weather. We just don\u2019t know the impact on weather both in terms of utility coal stockpiles and we don\u2019t know whether in terms of the impact of our network performance. So take all that together and when we add that and we\u2019ll look at it and we still say that double-digit is the right place to be. Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research : Okay. Thank you guys. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is from Jason Seidl with Cowen. Michael J. Ward:  Good morning Jason. Matt Elkott \u2013 Cowen and Company :  Good morning, this is actually Matt Elkott for Jason. Thank you for taking our question. I want to go back to the locomotive topic. My question is assuming current freight demand levels, when you guys start receiving the new locomotives is the focus going to be on moving more freight or is it moving similar freight levels more efficiently? Michael J. Ward: Yes and yes I think. It\u2019s an interesting question, but, no, absolutely. I mean, I think there is \u2013 whatever pent-up demand in customers that we have some areas where we can easily use more power will generate more business. But also importantly, to sort of turbocharge our system to spin more rapidly. So it will be useful for both of those areas. Matt Elkott \u2013 Cowen and Company :  Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the export coal topic, have you guys had to do more on the rate front in order to keep producers competitive with your fixed variable structure? Clarence W. Gooden: Matt, this is Clarence Gooden. First, we don\u2019t have fixed variable rates in the export coal. But to answer your question I think you were driving at, we said earlier on last quarter\u2019s call and to reiterate on this one, we are at the bottom on the export rates. So we\u2019re doing nothing, we are as low as we can go everything from here forward is up. Matt Elkott \u2013 Cowen and Company : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Michael J. Ward:  Good morning, Ben. Benjamin Hartford \u2013 Robert W. Baird & CO.: Good morning guys. I guess this is for Oscar. I just want to get a little bit more specific in terms of service expectations. You had talked about gradual improvement and I think Fredrik had talked about returning to service levels that you and your customers expect. I\u2019m just wondering more quantitatively what does that mean. Do you think that \u2013 if we use the high watermark of train velocity for let\u2019s say it was 2013, is it reasonable to expect that you can get back to those levels, the cycle, and we can define a cycle for as long as we need to? I mean, 2015, can train speed velocity get back to 2013 levels? Is that a realistic target? Do you think that \u2013 have you seen enough to think that surpassing those levels is unreasonable as well? I\u2019m just trying to get a perspective on how quickly and how fully we should expect service to be restored. Oscar Munoz :  I think to reiterate what was said before it is a gradual and not linear as we go into really the first half of 2015. I think after that fact I think \u2013 again, these things being trailing indicators, you\u2019ll begin to see them markedly increase and, yes, to previous levels and not necessarily static of that. I think as we spend more \u2013 we had two record years before this particular issue. I think it\u2019s easy to forget that. But I think once we get past this, really this power resource and again our volume sort of begins to stabilize as opposed to the surges that we\u2019ve had. I think it\u2019s important. I\u2019ll tell you, the confidence that I have from seeing all this just in this quarter alone, July we had about 14% GTM growth and that\u2019s a month where everyone takes off for vacation in our employee workforce in the union. And we struggled with that. I mean that was a power and crew issue. In our business the ability to recover is critical. And the fact that in this quarter you\u2019re seeing the results that we have, given the fact that a good four to six weeks was really a struggle period, I think sort of gives me the confidence that our recoverability process is there. Even with limited resources. So as we get more I think we\u2019ll improve again gradually, but not necessarily linear. Benjamin J. Hartford \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.:  Okay. And then, I guess, just a follow-on on that point, in terms of the employee count, it did, growth on a year-over-year basis did accelerate modestly through the quarter. Is there an idea when that growth rate will peak and then begin to decelerate? Clarence W. Gooden: I think we expect by the end of this year to be up about 2% and I think you\u2019ll see a slight increase in the first quarter as well. But it is nothing significant. The predominance of our hiring right now is in the T&E ranks and some on the support side and the mechanical side. But it is not a significant increase. Benjamin J. Hartford \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.: Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Clarence W. Gooden: Good morning. Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar Inc.:  Yes, kind of a question also related to crewing and labor. Longer-term question. What portion of TD labor works on hourly contracts now and do you see moving to hourly based compensation as beneficial for productivity and quality of life? Fredrik Eliasson : I don\u2019t think in terms of our T&E folks we have any hourly workforce. I think that obviously that could be a benefit. The question is ultimately what you have to do in order to make that work economically with the unions as you do go through those negotiations. Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar Inc.:  Maybe, Fredrik, I could switch to a CapEx question in light of the locomotive orders in your remarks that around 17% will be invested next year in CapEx. There\u2019s been a big slug of CapEx with PTC and maybe can you give us a quick update on where the spending is this year and next? And do you expect that CapEx would remain still in the 16% or 17% range even after PTC is fully invested at least for the heavy capital portion? Fredrik Eliasson :  Yes. So, PTC is above our core capital guidance, so that\u2019s 16% to 17% \u2013 around 17% next year excludes PTC. If you look at PTC in itself, we are spending about $300 million this year and by the end of this year we will spend about $1.2 billion. We\u2019ve said that cost is approximately $1.7 billion in total at least. And we will probably spend somewhere in the neighborhood of the same amount we\u2019re spending this year next year, and then it will start coming down after that. Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar Inc.:  Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Walter Spracklin with RBC. Michael J. Ward:  Good morning, Walter. Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. So two questions here, one for, I guess Clarence, one for Oscar. And, Clarence, just really a clarification on your fourth quarter outlook in particular for domestic coal and ag. Given the change in compares going into the fourth quarter 2013 they\u2019re quite substantial. I mean you did 15.5 million tons in fourth quarter of 2013, but you are running at a 20 million run rate this year. To say that it\u2019s favorable, I mean it would have to be up 25% to 30% to maintain the 20 million run rate. So are you indicating that we should look at some kind of seasonal drop in the fourth quarter, or do we run it at that kind of 20 million clips that you\u2019ve been experiencing this year even though it means up 25%, 30% year over year? Clarence W. Gooden : You\u2019re talking about coal? Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets :  Utility coal, domestic utility, yes. Clarence W. Gooden :  Oh, domestic utility coal. Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : I mean, you\u2019re 15.5 million fourth quarter 2013, but 20 million last quarter. So, I mean, if we are favorable, yes, up year-over-year you\u2019d have to be really up 25% to 30% to maintain 20 million tons. Just curious if that\u2019s what you are guiding. Are you guiding kind of continued 20 million or are we looking at a rather substantial downtick given the seasonal nature of the fourth quarter if seasonal at all? Clarence W. Gooden : Well, I\u2019m not looking at it on my sheet here in terms of tons. I was looking at it in terms of percentages, but I\u2019m guiding you to strong, a very strong fourth quarter in coal on a year-over-year basis. Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Right, okay. Clarence W. Gooden : Utility coal. Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Utility coal, okay. And I guess the same question kind of is for ag, right, except the flipside, you had a very strong fourth quarter last year, 113,000 carloads. This year you\u2019re \u2013 I mean this quarter you\u2019re 98,000. So flat would mean a significant downturn in the ag. Just curious if you are guiding us here relative to third quarter or relative to last year\u2019s fourth quarter? Michael J. Ward: Relative to the last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay, all right. Oscar, just a follow-up on the congestion side. You indicated that there are lots of opportunities that you have internally, all the railroads have internally to increasing capacity through your own strategies. At what point does that get exhausted? In other words, when you\u2019ve exhausted a good degree of your own capacity expansion issues or initiatives, where does the next pinch point come up? Oscar X. Munoz: Michael, let me tackle that. I think what we find is we have a fair amount of ability to continue to expand, a fair amount of our network is single track. We can add a second track to that, in fact a long passing siding and making it double track. So we have the ability on our line of road to incrementally add capacity and we are in the areas that are growing. So I think the horizon with which railroads can continue to increase their capacity on their own, I think is fairly long-term. Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay. So you are saying the next pinch point, several pinch points are all kind of inter \u2013 or intracompany, not necessarily between interchange points of Chicago or with your supply chain partners, anything like that? Michael J Ward : Well as Oscar said earlier, Chicago is complex and it is always going to be complex and we\u2019re working cooperatively to increase the throughput there. But I think your categorization and most of the needs to create capacity are internal to the existing individual railroads. Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Justin Long with Stephens. Michael J. Ward:  Good morning, Justin. Justin Long \u2013 Stephens, Inc.:  Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First one I wanted to ask was on intermodal margins. You\u2019ve talked over the last few quarters or so about how they\u2019ve caught up to other commodity groups with the exception of coal and chemicals. But as you look out over the next several years and think about the opportunity to get price and also build density, do you think that intermodal margins can be significantly better than the non-coal, non-chemicals businesses? Michael J. Ward:  Well. Certainly, intermodal margins are going up. They\u2019re going up for a couple of reasons. The trains are getting longer. The double stack clearances are obviously helping getting more density on the trains. The efficiencies that we have in the newer and more modern terminals with the automation that made the margins better. And frankly the price increases that we are getting in the marketplace now both in our international business and in our domestic business has got a long way towards improving those margins. So I think you\u2019ll see margin improvement in the intermodal marketplace as we move forward. Justin Long \u2013 Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And second question I wanted to ask \u2013 I know there is several intermodal terminal projects on the network you mentioned Montreal, the expansion at Northwest Ohio in the prepared comments. But is there any way you could quantify how much capacity the current intermodal terminal projects that are underway will add your network. Michael J. Ward:  Well. I don\u2019t have those numbers right in front of me, but we can make them available to you. Justin Long \u2013 Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. I will just follow-up on that. I appreciate the time. Michael J. Ward: Okay. Operator : Thank you. And our final question today is from Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie Capital. Michael J. Ward:  Good morning, Cleo. Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital : Thank you very much for taking my question. Good morning. My first question is about the outlook for rates on coal. You have already stated that you see the export rates only going up from here in terms of your stance. What do you \u2013 where do think we should see coal rates all add up to when we also consider the impact of fixed variable contracts on the domestic front and any mix issues? Michael J. Ward:  Well, I think Clarence \u2013 this is Michael, I think Clarence actually said that the export rates will not go down anymore. I think they won\u2019t go up unless we see a change in the world marketplace. So he was not saying they\u2019re going to go up, he was saying they would not go down anymore. On the domestic side, Clarence, maybe you could address what you are seeing there. Clarence W. Gooden: On the fixed variable, obviously as the tonnage goes up on that part of the fixed variable, and about a third of our contracts are under fixed variable, the average RPU will go down as the volume goes up. If the volume stays flat next year then you will see the rates will stay the same. If the volume goes down then the RPU will go up next year. Michael J. Ward: But your base pricing is going up. Clarence W. Gooden: But the base pricing itself is going up. Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital : Thank you. And my second question was with regards to EPS guidance. Prior to today, I think as of last quarter or even the most recent conference, you were saying that you expect to return to double-digit EPS growth beginning in 2015. And I would have taken that to mean that\u2019s the beginning of a series of years. Now you are saying you expect double-digit growth in 2015. Should we take this to mean any kind of change in long-term guidance for EPS beyond 2015? And any other comment you would like to make for beyond 2015 I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you. Fredrik J. Eliasson:  No, I think that overall our guidance has been 2015, I think we tried to stay away from longer-term guidance than that because of the fact that it\u2019s hard to predict. But our overall arching goal is to getting our operating margins is down to the mid-60s and that\u2019s the longer-term guidance that we have, but so there\u2019s no change in guidance from that perspective. Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital :  Thank you very much. Michael J. Ward: Thank you. Thank you everyone. We\u2019ll see you again next quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. You may disconnect your lines.",

And with that let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael? Michael J. Ward: Well, thank you David and good morning everyone. Yesterday, CSX reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.49, up 17% from $0.42 in the same period last year. This represents a new fourth quarter record for the company. Revenue grew 5% in the quarter to $3.2 billion, also a fourth quarter record with broad based growth across nearly all of our markets, reflecting continued economic momentum. Furthermore, the timely addition of operating resources enhanced through the peak and supported strong volume growth. As a result operating income increased 11% to a new fourth quarter record of $901 million and the operating ratio improved 140 basis points to 71.8%. This quarter's performance is further evidence of CSX's ability to capitalize on economic growth thus helping to drive strength across the company's diverse markets. Turning to the next slide I'll discuss our full year performance. The past four years have been transformative for CSX and we have emerged a stronger company for our customers and shareholders. That strength drove new full year records in 2014 for revenue at $12.7 billion, operating income at $3.6 billion and earnings per share of a $1.92 and the operating ratio remained essentially stable at 71.5%. That's an extraordinary testament to the work of the CSX employees because it follows a period during which we lost nearly $900 million of coal revenue as the country transitioned through changes in the energy sector. At the same time the diversity of CSX's business mix generated revenue more than offsetting these coal losses. That growth combined with inflation plus pricing, efficiency gains, and cash deployment for share buybacks generated modest earnings growth for the shareholders during this transition period.  These financial results are continued evidence that the company's employees, core strategy and diverse business mix can create sustainable value for shareholders even in an evolving and challenging business environment. With strategic infrastructure investments, locomotives and operating employees coming online, we expect service levels to gradually improve throughout 2015 to superior levels.  With that I'll turn the presentation over to Fredrik, who will take us through the top and bottom line results in more detail. Fredrik? Fredrik Eliasson : Thank you, Michael and good morning everyone. Let me begin by providing a summary of our fourth quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue increased 5% versus the prior year on 6% higher volume, driven by broad based strength across merchandise, intermodal and coal. Expenses increased 3% versus last year, driven primarily by higher volume and included a $39 million G&A workforce reduction charge.  Operating income was $901 million, up 11% or $88 million versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense and other income were slightly favorable versus the prior year period and income taxes were $284 million in the quarter, reflecting higher pretax earnings for an effective tax rate of approximately 37%. Overall, net earnings were $491 million and EPS was $0.49 per share, up 15% and 17% respectively versus the prior year period.  Now let me turn to the market outlook for the first quarter. Looking forward, we expect a positive demand environment in the first quarter with stable to favorable conditions for 96% of our markets and unfavorable conditions for the remaining 4%. Looking at some of the key markets chemicals is favorable as we continue to capture opportunities in the domestic oil and gas industry. Housing starts are expected to rise considerably in 2015, which should drive a favorable outlook across our construction markets, forest products, minerals and waste and equipment. Automotive is favorable, driven by growth in North American light vehicle production and the recovery of volume lost to trucking last year.  Strong intermodal growth will continue as our strategic network investment supports highway-to-rail conversions. We expect domestic coal volume growth will be strong in the first quarter attributable to cycling weaker first quarter 2014 volume and a new iron ore facility. Export coal volume is expected to be significantly lower in the first quarter, reflecting continued soft global market conditions. For the full year our best estimate at this time is around 30 million tons. Overall we anticipate high demand levels for our service will continue in the first quarter.  Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the first quarter. Beginning with labor and fringe, despite G&A workforce reductions we expect first quarter average headcount to increase sequentially by 1% as we continue to ramp up operating employees to accommodate higher volume. This represents a 4% increase versus the prior year. We expect 2015 labor inflation to be around $35 million per quarter in the first half and then moderate to around $25 million per quarter in the second half. This represents an increase from the $29 [ph] per quarter level seen in 2014, driven by union wage inflation and payroll taxes. The union component is consistent with what you should expect to see across the industry as a result of national bargaining and reflects both the carryover of the July 1, 2014 wage increase as well as the January 1, 2015 increase. In addition you will recall that we amended a locomotive maintenance agreement in June of 2014, which resulted in a $15 million shift between labor and MS&O expense lines in both the third and the fourth quarters. This trend will continue in 2015 and we will be cycling the expense shift during the first half of the year. Looking at MS&O expense we expect the first quarter to be driven by inflation and volume growth in line with the trend seen during 2014. Fuel expense in the first quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon, reflecting the current price environment, higher volume and continued fuel efficiency through technology and process initiatives. We expect depreciation to increase around $10 million versus the prior year in each quarter in 2015. This reflects the ongoing investment in our business partially offset by an asset life study conducted in the fourth quarter. Finally equipment and other rents in the first quarter is expected to increase year-over-year driven by higher freight car rates and incremental volume. Now let me talk about our capital investment plan for 2015. In 2015 CSX plans to invest $2.5 billion in our business. This represents a moderate increase from the 2014 level and core investment is expected to be about 17% of revenue. In the chart on the left you can see that about half the capital investment will be used to maintain core infrastructure to help ensure a safe and fluid network. Equipment investment in locomotives and freight cars ensure CSX has an appropriate level of rolling stock to support commercial demand and improve on time performance levels. In addition we will continue to focus on strategic investment to support long-term profitable growth and productivity initiatives. In 2015 we are prioritizing infrastructure projects that will increase line of road capacity on the northern tier to improve fluidity and system velocity.  Finally looking at our investment in Positive Train Control, we have invested $1.2 billion through the end of 2014 and plan to invest an additional $300 million in 2015. As the implementation of PTC extends over a longer period of time we anticipate spending at least $400 million beyond 2015. As a result our current estimate for the total cost of PTC is at least $1.9 billion. Now let me wrap up on the next slide. Overall CSX delivered solid financial performance in 2014, with robust volume growth offsetting the impact of last year\u2019s weather, network performance and a weak coal pricing environment. We continue to see broad-based strength across our diverse business portfolio and the strength is translating into more visible and more meaningful earnings improvements. CSX achieved double-digit earnings growth in both the third and the fourth quarters and incremental operating margins expanded throughout the year. For the full year 2015 CSX still expects to achieve double digit EPS growth. Even as we cycle strong 2014 volume growth we expect merchandise and intermodal to again grow at a faster pace than the broader economy. We continue to target pricing above inflation as capacity remains tight across all modes of transportation and we expect to deliver productivity savings approaching $200 million in 2015. Domestic coal volume should remain relatively stable in 2015 while the export coal market remains challenged. That said we will be keeping a close watch on natural gas prices and heating and cooling degree days as we move through the year.  Finally we expect margin expansion to resume in 2015 which reflects improving service levels, a strong pricing environment and continued economic expansion. Over the longer term we continue to target an operating ratio in the mid-60s. With that let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks. Michael J. Ward: Thank you, Fredrik. The strong 2014 demand reinforced the importance of freight rail industry and CSX in supporting the global supply chain and American competitiveness, the economic and environmental benefits of freight rail network increasingly serve a country with a growing population and a critical need for transportation infrastructure. To continue delivering these benefits and creating value for its shareholders CSX has transformed itself by forging new capabilities aligned with opportunities in energy, manufacturing, agriculture and global commerce. We are generating record results by leveraging the most diverse business risk -- business mix in the company's history with new opportunities across nearly all of the markets we serve.  We remain focused on executing our core strategy of delivering service excellence for our customers, which drives our ability to grow merchandize and intermodal businesses faster than the economy, twice above the inflation and continue to drive improvements in asset utilization. The company is poised for a bright future of strong financial returns and expansion and we thank you for your ownership of and interest in CSX.  Now we'll be glad to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conduction a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Michael J. Ward : Good morning Tom. Thomas Wadewitz : Good morning, Michael, Fredrik, David. Wanted to see if you could talk a bit about utility coal and I guess your visibility to stockpiles. And also how much risk you see if natural gas prices stay at current levels or go below in terms of switching from coal to gas and how that might effect? Clarence W. Gooden: Good morning, Tom. This is Clarence. Thomas Wadewitz : Yeah, hi Clarence. Clarence W. Gooden: We see the stockpiles, both in the north and the south are pretty much where we expected them to be. They're at normal levels, in both the north and the south. We think the comps in the first quarter will be very favorable for us, when you look at the -- what the weather was last year versus what the weather is this year. Yes, these gas prices stay where they are now, which are around $3 or sub $3 there could be some downside risk out in the quarters two and three from what we have planned. But for right now it looks to us like the rest of the year should be around flat going forward. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay, great. And then the, I guess the follow-up question we had such a dramatic move in oil prices. I think it's hard to get your arms around where, what the impact could be across your book. Obviously there could be some risk accrued by rail or frac sand and pipe and so forth. But I guess given what you see right now, if you look to the second half of the year would you expect that to come through and drive weakness in those areas or how would you look at, maybe not just first quarter but out a little bit more in terms of effective lower oil prices on your book of business. Michael J. Ward : Right now, as we look out through 2015 we don't see any significant impact at all in our crude oil by rail into the eastern markets and certainly in our frac sand markets where we're moving into the Utica and the Marcellus area, where the natural gas and the natural gas liquids are we don't think it will impact the frac sands that we're moving into those areas at all. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay, great, thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Michael J. Ward : Good morning Allison. Allison Landry : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Following up on Tom's question, how are you thinking about the sort of broader economic tailwinds that result from lower oil prices and if we think about as an area where, let\u2019s just say for arguments say that we have crude and anything shale related evaporates. How we think about where you could see upside in intermodal or some of your other lines of business? Michael J. Ward : Allison, we feel very positive about it. There has been some studies that come out that essentially only ten states have employment that\u2019s directly impacted by the oil boom, is less than 2% of the U.S. population. For us the crude by rail is less than 2% of our business. It -- for the average U.S. tax -- U.S. person it\u2019s like a tax break of almost $2000 a year. So puts a lot of dollars into the economy. From any indication that we see it\u2019s a positive experience for the American tax payer, for the American economy. So I think lower crude oil prices is a very positive for our economy and very positive for CSX. Allison Landry : Okay, great. And then as my follow-up question, the $200 million of productivity gains, that's quite a bit higher than what you\u2019ve generated in the last few years, which has averaged, I think $130 million to $140 million. Is this inclusive of the incremental or unusual weather expense that you saw last year or is that sort of on top of the $200 million? Oscar Munoz : Allison, this is Oscar Munoz. I think a portion of that number is weather, although not as significant as you might think, probably 15% of that number roughly. Allison Landry : Okay. Fredrik Eliasson : So to clarify on the $200 million, so what we have is the operation\u2019s normal target of about $130 million to $150 million plus we have about $50 million that is linked to the G&A workforce reduction program, that we outlined, the severance charge in our fourth quarter. Allison Landry : Okay. And then the rest could be weather? Fredrik Eliasson : Part of the operations, productivity savings is to cycle what we cycle last year. Allison Landry : Okay. Fredrik Eliasson : As Oscar outlined. Allison Landry : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Michael J. Ward : Good morning Rob. Robert Salmon : Hey, good morning guys. As a follow-up to Allison's question, could you give us a sense in terms of what sort of network, how you're expecting the network to return to normal, and what sort of key velocity and what metrics we should be looking for as you're thinking about that $200 million? Michael J. Ward : Thanks Rob. So the productivity initiatives are broad and across a lot of different aspects, volume absorption, specific initiatives from the weather, winter, sort of overlap. But I think if you think of the incremental resources that are coming on line it's going to just re-establish the discipline that we've had over the past three or four years around the internal operations of both scheduled and the unscheduled networks. And specifically while velocity would be a bit of a lagging indicator as we dwell on the public measures you see, I think dwell in particular will be a key metric to watch. Internally we have intermediate and home terminal dwell that we're monitoring, but I think the dwell, I think will be an area that you can focus on and that when it stops dwelling there it increases cost in a big way and that'll be the first focus and benefit from the incremental resources. Robert Salmon : That's helpful and did you guys quantify the savings expectations for the employee management, workforce reduction program and was any realized in the fourth quarter? Michael J. Ward : So the estimate is about $50 million for the overall program which labor is the largest part of that but there is also some other MS&O savings and to the question around if anything was realized on the fourth quarter, no none was realized really in the fourth quarter. Robert Salmon : Perfect. Thanks for your time guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Michael J. Ward : Good morning, Thomas. Thomas Kim : Good morning. I just wanted to ask about the fuel surcharges. If we go back through history, the last time oil prices collapsed the way they did, your recovery was quite effective in capturing the fuel cost savings. And as we look forward to this year with obviously the precipitous drop, do you think that your fuel surcharges are well placed to ensure that you're able to fully sort of neutralize the impact of lower surcharges with the drop in fuel? Fredrik Eliasson : This is Fredrik. Yes we do think we have a fuel surcharge mechanism that is effective. It's not a profit driver but it makes us neutral to fuel price volatility. There are periods such as when the prices decline that we get the lag benefit which we saw here in the fourth quarter and likewise when fuel rises our fuel surcharge mechanism lags a little bit. So we have a little bit of detriment there. But overall the fuel surcharge is working well and we think that we are neutral to any sort of price volatility with the exception of the lag effect. Thomas Kim : That's great, and that's very helpful. And I guess just in terms of this decrease, obviously certainly beneficial for customers. How do you think this helps you in terms of your ability to push through higher GRIs during the course of the year versus some general pricing? Clarence W. Gooden: Well, Thomas, this is Clarence. I think it's positive for us. It's less cost obviously overall in the package to the customer. So as we push for our price increases it makes it more powerful as we go to the customer and the overall package. Thomas Kim : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Michael J. Ward : Good morning, Bill. William Greene : Hi. Good morning. Clarence, can I ask you to follow-up a little bit on that pricing comment. So I would guess that we are going to start lapping some of the big export coal price declines, so that's going to make our comps, I would think a bit easier in '15 and of course the overall market is a lot stronger, particularly on the truck side. So I think that would be helpful to your pricing dynamic. So is there any flaw in the logic to think that pricing for CSX in \u201815 should be stronger than it was in \u201814. Clarence W. Gooden: No, I think you're absolutely correct. I think you'll see much stronger pricing in \u201915 than you did in '14, absolutely. William Greene : Okay so and then maybe for Fredrik or for Oscar, as we think about the cost structure in so far as volumes disappoint us this year, so they're unexpectedly weak, how much of your cost structure is variable, how much can you sort of tweak that $200 million higher if you had to and how much is more fixed such that as you dedicate these resources, locomotives, employees to move the current volume, we run the risk that we create a higher fixed cost structure in the second half, let's say. Fredrik Eliasson : Well, and I think if you go back to 2008-2009 timeframe, you can see what we did there, which was pretty remarkable in terms of variabalizing the cost structure. And in this scenario that we don't think that you're going to be -- you're correctly predicting or forecasting but if volume will be softer than we are currently anticipating we do have the opportunity to take cost out more than what we have in the current plan. And we have proven that in the past that our cost structure is more variable than perhaps might some people might think. William Greene : Yeah, I think helpful to note that volume is not [inaudible]. Fredrik Eliasson : Correct. Oscar Munoz : And we're answering a hypothetical question, Bill. I know specifically when you think of crews and locomotives, our most expensive aspect of that, I've got roughly a 1000 people in the pipeline and I've got roughly a 1000 people potential attrition. So that I think offset in itself and then on the locomotive side we've got least returns that we can work through. So I think citing back to the old days of '08, '09 when we sort of did the math and proved the variability that has come into this industry. So we monitor that very closely. William Greene : Yeah, no, things look stronger obviously. It's more just folks worried if, is the oil price indicative of some weakening that\u2019s bound down to come. So just trying to think through what your flexibility is. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Michael J. Ward : Good morning, Ken. Ken Hoexter : Good morning. Just a quick question on export coal, can you, guys can you talk about what is left on contract within the export side and what is still variable, just looking at the market rate it just seems like stuff that export coal side just shouldn't moving at these prices. So maybe just some thoughts on the export side. Michael J. Ward : Well, we have about 40% of the export contracts are currently -- export coal movements are currently under contract. The rest of it is up for negotiation. That answer your question? Ken Hoexter : Yeah, is that kind of typical at the 40% or is that obviously increasing amounts coming on too? Michael J. Ward : I would say that's fairly typical this early in the cycle. Most of those are metallurgical contracts, as you're aware tend to go more on quarterly basis, but still tend to follow traditional line of thinking, which pretty much settles in March April. Ken Hoexter : Okay and then just a follow up on the service metrics issue. You hit on the dwell and velocity. Oscar can you talk about the on-time performance, just seems like it continues to remain at that 50% level. What needs to happen to get that back, is that decreasing congestion, is it just fixing something, getting more locomotives and crew. Can you walk us through that a little bit? Oscar Munoz : Yeah, we really are down to that point, Ken and locomotives are the biggest, last sort of aspect of this and we've got 200 over the course of 2014 and roughly 100 here in the first quarter, another 150 or so in the second quarter and our service measures and lot of things will be almost pretty significantly correlated to the arrivals of those locomotives. Crews have been trickling in over the course of the year. So we're in pretty decent shape there. It is a power issue up against this great volume that we're getting. It's important to know we are in essence open for business. Our fluidity has gotten a little bit better across the network. Our cost structure is improving. I mean the span around our misses is a little bit narrower. We got crews and locomotives coming online, and the infrastructure that we've been building has improved fluidity. So we're feeling good about where we are starting the year. Ken Hoexter : Wonderful, appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Michael J. Ward : Good morning Brandon. Keith Mori : Hi good morning. This is Keith Mori on for Brandon. Could you give us an idea of the cost associated with improving service levels this quarter tied to the recovery? And kind of when should we think these costs start to go away? Oscar you mentioned that service levels are starting to improve, the cost structure starting to improve, should we start to think that\u2019s a first half event? Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah, so this is Fredrik. I think if you go back to the third quarter we were somewhere around $15 million to $20 million, so what we call service-related cost, the network wasn\u2019t -- the performance level we wanted, the fluidity wasn't there, so extra overtime and equipment rent and so forth. Here in the fourth quarter probably pretty similar to that and as Oscar outlined as we get the additional locomotives we should see the fluidity improve and therefore see reduction in overtime and improvement in our equipment rents et cetera and that\u2019s going to come gradually. I think it\u2019s unrealistic to think that it\u2019s going to be meaningful here in the first quarter because while the weather has cooperated so far we are not through it yet and generally that slows things down but as you get to the second quarter and we get the brunt of the equipment specific to the locomotives that we are expecting, I think at that point and late in the second quarter I think you should start seeing some significant improvements. Keith Mori : Okay. And I guess the follow-up, what kind of inspired kind of the recent workforce reduction program? When you look across the operations are there any other strategic initiatives that you can kind of point to or talk about that are similar type cost impacts? Fredrik Eliasson : Well, I think in terms of the G&A workforce reduction, it simply was an opportunity for us to streamline some functions, stop doing some of the things that we has been doing and just process changes allowed us to be little bit more aggressive there. We\u2019ve had a program in place for six, seven years now to try to offset inflation. We have been able to do that but this was just a way to be a little bit more aggressive on that side. We, through the pipeline of productivity initiatives that we have as a company not just for \u201815 and \u201816 and \u201917, where we try to get that $130 million, $150 million a year. We continue to work very hard. That\u2019s a big part of the value equation for CSX and has been over the last decade. It\u2019s going to continue to be over the next decade. Keith Mori : All right. Thank you for the time. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi Research. Michael J. Ward: Good morning, Chris. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, good morning guys, thanks. When you think about the double-digit earnings growth for 2015 and you look at sort of the various buckets of the opportunities that are presented, where do you think sort of the potential risk could come from? Clarence you talked about the domestic coal side sort of up in the first quarter and I guess implies sort of down in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q based on flat for the full year. Does it come from there if natural gas prices stay at these levels or dip down? I guess I just wanted to get a rough sensitivity of the variability of the model. I know you talked about costs too. So just some color there would be great. Clarence W. Gooden: Sure, I mean with any plan that you put together there are challenges and there are opportunities and I would say that the challenges that we are seeing is on the coal side and on the crude side right now. We feel that on the domestic side that while we think flat is the right place to be, there is probably more down side then upside to that. Export we outlined that we expect export volumes to drop close to 25% for the year and crude, while we are not hearing from our customers that there are any change in the shipping patterns, clearly we are monitoring that closely as well. But if you look at the opportunity side, I think you have heard about our productivity initiatives close to $200 million. We expect to grow our non-coal business faster than the economy as a whole and the pricing environment continues to be -- to get stronger and stronger frankly.  So when you add all that up we feel that double digit is the right place to be, it\u2019s -- nothing is ever slam dunk because it wouldn\u2019t be meaningful guidance if it was, but it is something that we think we can achieve. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just a follow-up, just thinking about the pricing dynamic that you just mentioned certainly it seems like it\u2019s firming up into \u201915. When you think about intermodal and the relationship to truck with declining fuel surcharges, it would still seem that there is the ability to price that business up at a reasonable pace given what\u2019s going on in the truck market but just wanted to get some rough sense do you feel it\u2019s tapped to some extent if we see diesel prices continue to fall from where they are currently? Clarence W. Gooden: Chris, this is Clarence. I think there is a very positive trend in the intermodal pricing. We see that the truck issue still remain there even with the 34 hour rule that\u2019s been turned back. There is capacity issues, there is driver issues. Even with class A truck orders being up there is still the issues of being able to get the drivers to move the business. So we think there is a lot of pricing opportunities in intermodal itself. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, perfect. Thanks for the time guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ben Hartford with Baird. Michael J. Ward : Good morning, Ben. Benjamin Hartford : Hey, good morning, guys. Just turning the attention to longer term margin outlook in the reiteration there, a lot of focus on \u201815 but if we can put \u201815 aside, what is contemplated in terms of, I guess maybe what\u2019s required to get to the mid-60s, target long term, if you could speak in kind of broad strokes as it relates to coal and crude, and then base pricing and productivity gains and service normalizing and those types of items. I mean how are you thinking about the calculus to get to that mid-60s target. Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah, this is Fredrik. Clearly we expect to start moving towards that mid-60s here in 2015, after having absorbed that close to $900 million of coal loss over the last couple of years. And we are going to make some meaningful improvements towards there. Now if we think about the three components it\u2019s ultimately price, volume and productivity, the last decade it was more probably price and productivity and as we think about the next decade, I think it's going to be more evenly split between the three, as we continue to see good volume opportunities for us. We continue to have a strong healthy pipeline of productivity initiatives, not just for 2015 but in the years beyond that as well. And then pricing environment after having been a little bit slower over the last couple of years I think it's becoming more vibrant as well. So the three of those components together we have continued good cash deployment, of the free cash flow is the way we get there. It's continuously the sort of blocking and tackling that we done over the last couple of decades that got us from the kind of the high 80s down to the low 70s. We're going to continue to push that going forward. Benjamin Hartford : There\u2019s a couple of specific questions, does it require a strengthening of the pricing environment from current levels, one? And two from a coal standpoint does it require any improvement in the coal markets relative to whatever the base line is for '15. I guess those are the two key concerns in terms of the sensitivities that we have. Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah, I think we're going to try to stay away from too much of the detail around specific pieces, because generally I said before, whenever we put a plan together, I think it will be obsolete as soon as you put the plan together. But in terms of pricing specifically, inflation plus pricing is critical to everything that we do. We are not necessarily banking on coal, on the domestic side coming back significantly from where it is today. It would be nice to see but that's not necessarily anything we're banking on. Export coal we're in a down cycle at the moment and two years from now who knows what it's going to be. But we think there is enough other factors within our business to drive that earnings growth without just focusing too much on the coal business itself. Benjamin Hartford : Okay, that's helpful. And then real quick, if you can, just a clarification on the tax side, what are you assuming for a tax rate for 2015? Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah, generally we see a tax rate that\u2019s right around 37.5%, was a little bit lower this quarter because there is some tax credits that we got, but generally about 37.5%. Benjamin Hartford : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Michael J. Ward : Good morning, Cherilyn. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. It was fairly nice to see your pricing improve sequentially. And I just wonder, given the nature of the contracts you have in place, how long should we expect it to take before that tightness in transportation capacity which really emerged in Q2 '14 is more fully reflected in your same store pricing? Michael J. Ward : Well, our pricing is -- thank you for noticing by the way they improved sequentially. It's like sometimes watching paint dry to watch those numbers go up. I think you're going to see it improve sequentially each quarter going forward. We have momentum in it. We are constantly watching what happens in that pricing. About 20% of our contracts will renew in the first quarter. We expect to get very strong pricing in the first quarter as the year progresses. I think you will see it improve sequentially in each of those quarters, particularly in our non-coal business. Cherilyn Radbourne : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just a quick follow-up, your quarterly materials mentioned that resource constraints impacted your ag shipments in Q4. Just curious whether there were other areas where you missed out on the full volume opportunity because of resources. Michael J. Ward : Mainly in our ag business and in our aggregates, our stone business. We were constrained in both of those areas in the fourth quarter. That has improved significantly here in the first quarter. Our aggregate business in the first quarter, except in some of our northern areas where it's been weather impacted has significantly improved as well as in our ag business. Cherilyn Radbourne : Great, thank you. That's it from me. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein. Michael J. Ward : Good morning, David. David S. Vernon : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Hey, Fredrik, as we -- given what we know right now about fuel prices and obviously given the outlook for kind of flat domestic and down export coal, would you expect full year revenue in '15 to be up or down relative to '14. Fredrik Eliasson : I would expect it to be up but and clearly that depends on ultimately what you think about the fuel itself. But we do expect, as we said, our overall merchandise and intermodal business to grow faster than economy as a whole and domestic to be flat and the export coming down. But I still think we have an opportunity to grow the revenue. The key part here is that fuel surcharges really pass through for us. So even if the overall revenue number comes down because of fuel surcharge, really it doesn't impact the bottom line except for the lag as I said earlier. David S. Vernon : Okay and then maybe just as a quick follow-on, how does the service metrics and stuff like that play out in the pricing environment. Obviously Clarence you've sort of made the point here that you\u2019re expecting pricing to accelerate next year. Is that in line with the service recovery or you're expecting to be able to kind of take that rate up, kind of independent trucks maybe getting modally competitive and the service level still being weak. Clarence W. Gooden: I think the answer is yes to both questions. I think just the overall capacity issues in all of the modes of transportation, whether it\u2019s barge, truck or rail has given us a positive pricing environment and certainly as our services improve, and I'd like to point out that we had a point of inflation last summer. Our service has been continually improving since last summer. In fact this fall, in our fall peak we had an excellent fall peak with UPS for example being one of our prime premium service partners. Our service has been continually improving and that makes it much easier for our sales force to go out and get the rate. David S. Vernon : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from John Larkin with Stifel Nicolaus. Michael J. Ward : Good morning John. John G. Larkin: Hey, good morning gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. Just with the service levels having remained stable but maybe not where you\u2019d like to see them or your customers would like to see them, what was the decision thinking behind keeping your CapEx just a little bit greater than last year. There was one railroad in the west that dramatically increased their CapEx. Why didn't you decide to do that to try and accelerate the service recovery? Michael J. Ward : Well, I think we took it up slightly and that's really a reflection of the fact that we do need to get the power and that's where the biggest area is now for opportunities to make an impact on the service recovery. So maybe we could have got more locomotives but the reality is that we can't get more locomotives right now and but even with the locomotives we're getting and our internal repair opportunity, because we do have a fair amount of locomotives internally that we're bringing back in revenue service that perhaps other railroads might not have that opportunity and that's a cheaper form of capacity than buying new ones. John G. Larkin: Got it. Thanks. And then as a follow-on to the service related issues, some of the service problems I guess are caused by issues beyond our control, i.e. all the connecting traffic over Chicago. Can you talk a little bit about how Chicago is operating now and how the railroads have worked together to try and increase the fluidity over that critical hub? Oscar Munoz : Hey, John, it's Oscar. We've had knock on wood, a good almost 11 plus weeks where Chicago has been on what we call a normal alert level and so that's the good news. The communication and coordination that you referred to and we've always known it's been critical, it's been ramped up, both at the most senior levels of the industry but also at the local level, with that Chicago terminal coordinating office and the efforts around that. And so everybody is working closely around that. We've been -- we've had a couple of fits and starts. Chicago was incredibly cold last week, we mustered through that. We all take our turns in the barrel, been a little struggling through various interchange points, by and large the entire industry is working very closely and very well so far with that.  Now next few weeks will test us again and of course when volume returns here in the spring peak, week nine or so, we're focusing on that, but so far so good John. John G. Larkin: Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial. Michael J. Ward : Good morning. Bascome Majors : Good morning. You've talked before about the intermodal margins in your portfolio rising to a level fairly in line with the rest of your business with the exception of coal and chemicals. Can you just give us a little update on where intermodal margins are tracking directionally versus your other businesses today and whether or not the big drop in diesel price is going to impact the profitability of intermodal going forward? Fredrik Eliasson : This is Fredrik. Yes, so if you look at the margins, when you exclude chemicals and coal it's pretty much in line with the rest of our merchandize business. Because of the fuel surcharge that we have in place in the intermodal business that essentially mirrors the trucking industry, when you see price volatility, when prices come down as they have done here on the fuel side, what happens is not so much that this is a volume play for the industry, it\u2019s really the fact that our margins in intermodal gets a little squeezed, because we are more fuel efficient, so more of the dollar from fuel surcharge in intermodal goes to the bottom line; net-net for CSX that's not the case, but just on intermodal business itself. So there is some margins squeeze when fuel comes down but it's not significant and if the statement that it\u2019s in line with the rest of our business is still a true statement. Bascome Majors : Okay Thank you for that color and just one question on export coal and other pricing comps get much easier year-over-year as we go forward. What do you expect sequentially in 1Q as we think about your business? Michael J. Ward : What do we expect sequentially in\u2026? Bascome Majors : In export coal pricing? Michael J. Ward : As far as the pricing goes we think it's going to be flat. Bascome Majors : All right. Thanks for the time guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Michael J. Ward : Good morning Jeff. Jeffrey Kauffman : Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. Mike, I have a question about a comment you made on your CNBC interview yesterday, where you had mentioned that the suppliers that you were working with out of Bakken to ship the crude by rail to the East Coast, you had thought that at $35 oil that they could be competitive. You obviously understand a little more about this than we do. Could you help us understand, because you mention the frac sand volumes were just fine, the crude by rails moving fine, what gives you confidence that you would continue to see these types of volumes at $35 crude? Michael J. Ward : Well, we don\u2019t want [ph] start at $35 but we think they could continue at the existing facilities to be competitive. As you know once you made that investment you can get back in their refractors and get additional -- without additional huge capital outlays. So we think that this short intermediate term which certainly includes all of '15, we think that these shipments we've been seen roughly 3.5 trains per day continues and maybe even rose a little bit. Longer term, if the prices stay at those levels there is questions whether the capital will go back in for new facilities, Jeff. Jeffrey Kauffman : Okay, no, I just wanted some clarity on that. Mike thanks so much and congratulations. Michael J. Ward : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Michael J. Ward : Good morning Scott. Scott Group : Hey, good morning guys. Wanted to just clarify couple of things on coal, does the -- how much is the iron ore, the new iron ore business and is that inclusive in your commentary on flat domestic? And then when you think about those moving parts of iron ore less export coal, fixed variables on the domestic side, how should we think about yields in 2015 coal, positive or negative? Michael J. Ward : Well, the iron ore is a large move. It's both the prior and subsequent move, meaning that it's -- the raw material comes in, is processed and then it goes out as a finished product of iron ore. And the yields you should consider going forward to be very positive. It\u2019s included in your domestic -- that is included in the domestic coal, yes. Scott Group : Okay, that's helpful. And then just one for you Fredrik, the past few quarters you've given us kind of some rough parameters or guidelines for how you think about earnings in the current quarter, and this is -- the first quarter is kind of a tougher one just because of the comps and weather last year. Any color or comments you want to give us on first quarter earnings, I'm guessing because given the comps, that's going to be good if not better than just couple of digit earnings growth but any additional color you have would be helpful. Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah, I think that's what we tried to lay out, the kind of key assumptions by expense item in the presentation itself. So you know how we're thinking about, I gave you some of the components there. Clearly you're right that the first quarter, I think will be a strong quarter and supportive of our double digit earnings growth for the year. Scott Group : Okay, thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Michael J. Ward : Good morning, Jason. Jason Seidl : Hey, good morning everyone. How are you guys today? Michael J. Ward : Great. Jason Seidl : Just want to focus a little bit on some of the non-coal export side. Obviously we've seen sort of Russia sort of in and now of the wheat market and then this morning I think Shell received some favorable product classification ruling for condensate export. Could you talk about things that could provide upside to the numbers on the exports side for you guys? Michael J. Ward : You want export in terms of condensate or export in terms of coal? Jason Seidl : Export in terms of anything. Michael J. Ward: Non-coal. Most of the condensate that I am aware of, that\u2019s being exported out of this country is mostly being exported over to Gulf. So for example Mexico and the United States couple of days ago have a major exchange of condensates in heavy petroleum products that are being exported and exchanged mainly through the Texas refinery. So that\u2019s where you will see most of it. The East Coast has some condensates that will be exported through York Town but they are very small numbers that impact us. So we are not seeing a lot of that activity that you are describing in the condensate. Jason Seidl : Okay. And anything on the export ag side? Michael J. Ward: The soybean market is pretty heavy, mainly out of Norfolk and out of Mobil and we are seeing quite a bit of activity in those areas. Jason Seidl : Okay, and as a follow-up, guys getting back to pricing, we saw in our survey that we do to the shipping community that we published yesterday, when you are talking about an acceleration throughout the year, I am assuming this is obviously going to be ex-coal but where are you going to get the most bang for your buck, is this primarily in your truck competitive business? Michael J. Ward: On the pricing side? Jason Seidl : Yes. Michael J. Ward: I think we are getting it across all segments of our market place. If you look margins are tight right now. So we are able to get pricing in those areas in our bulk commodities. We are able to get pricing, particularly in the truck side of the businesses coming up. So pricing right now is very much in favor of the carriers. Jason Seidl : Okay, gentlemen. Thank you for your time as always. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Troy with Nomura. Michael J. Ward : Good morning, Matt. Matthew Troy : Hey, good morning, guys. Question, a lot of people out there talking about the decline in fuel prices, lowering the absolute per mile cost for trucking. Obviously intermodal rates are going to go down as well as the surcharges decline there but just curious academically or in practice are you hearing from any of your customers about a desire to switch from intermodal back to trucking. Some folks are speculating that. I would think now they just can\u2019t switch a whole bunch of business into an industry that doesn\u2019t have capacity but given that prices have come in I figured I would ask the question, are you seeing it, do you see it as a risk to intermodal in 2015? Michael J. Ward: We absolutely do not. The big issue that has been in trucking remains the big issue in trucking and that is driver availability. Most people that I am aware of don\u2019t want their sons to grow up to be truck drivers. And so truck drivers become an issue. People don\u2019t want to be away from home five, six, seven days. There is issues in passing the drug test to get a commercial CDL. There are barriers to entry and becoming a truck driver and getting new class A trucks purchased and the cost of getting into the business is much higher. So it\u2019s more than just having the capacity itself. It\u2019s all the issues that surround it. So we see intermodal in fact growing. Our intermodal business grew faster last year than the GDP the country did. If you look at the AAR data intermodal in general grew faster than the economy did last year. So I think what you are reading in the period articles is people writing that don\u2019t have anything to write about. Matthew Troy : Right, but that is more an academic observation, lower fuel surcharges don\u2019t create drivers. I guess my second follow-up question would be natural gas if you look at the futures curve it\u2019s implying pretty much $3-ish for the rest of the year, or well into the year. Just wondering, I know that Appalachian coal and from a switching perspective has been out of the money for some time, should we just think about the vulnerability in your domestic coal business being Illinois Basin at current levels of $3 and have you kind of triangulated in your guidance in that gas price assumption in your earlier comments about 1Q flat for the year. Just wondering what might be at risk, because last time we saw gas down here stockpiles were north of 200 million tons, we\u2019re at a six year low at 130 million tons. So that variable obviously won\u2019t hurt, just trying to triangulate what might be vulnerable if we stay at $3. Thanks. Michael J. Ward : Well, about 47%, 48% of our coal business today comes out of Northern App or the Illinois Basin. So we try to look around $3, $3.50 natural gas as a number that if you get much under that, we start to hurt a little bit in our barn. So those are the numbers that we try and [inaudible]. Matthew Troy : Okay and Illinois Basin is that -- you're not hearing anything about switching from those customers you have? Michael J. Ward : Well, I'm not sure exactly what you're asking about but what we're seeing is a lot of our customers are moving to the Illinois Basin coal, which is good for us because it gives us a longer length of haul, gives us higher RPU and it's a good thing for us. Matthew Troy : Well, I was just more talking about the switching sensitivities in the various sourcing basins, but I got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie Capital. Michael J. Ward : Good morning Cleo. Cleo Zagrean : Good morning and thank you, and happy new year. My first question is also with regards to the domestic coal business. Can you help us think just more specifically around the sensitivity of EPS for '15 to plus or minus 5% or whichever you think is good for a band in domestic coal volume, around that base case of flat for this year? What would plus or minus 5% domestic coal do to EPS for '15 given the profitability and the new profits are up in your mix, and also given the fixed variable structure that we've seen effect earnings so far. Thank you. Fredrik Eliasson : This is Fredrik. I think that there is a fixed variable that is less of an issue. I think in terms of the sensitivity it's clear that our sensitivity if coal comes down and is not flat, that's going to be sensitivities to our EPS guidance. But at the same time as we said there are opportunities to offset that. So there is a lot of different pieces that goes into our guidance. So I think it's a little bit dangerous to isolate specific pieces. But we add all the things up at this earlier and we think about the business as a whole and some of the vibrancy we're seeing in certain markets and some of the productivity opportunities, the pricing, we feel that we can absorb some of those sensitivities on the coal side, but it's -- we\u2019ll have to wait and see, we're going to have to get couple of quarter under the belt, until we get full visibility into what is doable and what's not doable for the year. Cleo Zagrean : Thank you. And my second question is with regards to operating ratio excluding fuel. You've highlighted deservedly that fuel is a pass through. So I would appreciate any help you can give us to think about the performance of the business ex this noise in the revenue and expense line. Are you looking at pass through for ex-fuel, any kind of progression that you have in mind if you can share with us so we can track performance on that basis. Thank you. Fredrik Eliasson : Well, the positive lag in the quarter itself here for the fourth quarter was about $23 million and I think $16 million year-over-year. So that was a favorable coming from fuel. We also saw a little bit of favorability because the wholesale prices I think came down faster than the retail prices and it\u2019s the retail prices at our fuel surcharge is tied to. So what we pay to the pump probably declines faster than the fuel surcharge revenue itself. So that\u2019s another benefit that we saw here this quarter. But overall frankly if you look at our margin expansion our operating ratio, this is not a profit element if fuel prices come down, it\u2019s actually generally slightly positive to our path towards the 65% operating ratio longer term. But as I said overall not a profit element. There is some lag effects and here we saw an additional lag perhaps even in the fourth quarter or the fact that wholesale prices went down faster than retail prices. And that\u2026 Cleo Zagrean : So when that -- so I'm sorry, so in a lower fuel price environment, should we expect that you are finding it easier to reach that mid-60 target sooner? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, in the material scheme of things, but if we just think about the fact that you're adding for example $100 million at the revenue line and you're adding a $100 million to the expense line, this is not a profit driver. The operating ratio of that is 100% because you're not getting a margin on that. So as fuel price comes down and your fuel expense goes down a corresponding amount you actually get a little bit of benefit from that. Cleo Zagrean : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Michael J. Ward : Good morning, Keith. Keith Schoonmaker : Good morning. I'd like to ask about the 2% decline in chemicals revenue per unit, is this simply a mix issued where growth in crude where the shipper provides the tank car is a having a mixed effect on this or is this something else at work? Michael J. Ward : Absolutely, you are correct. Keith Schoonmaker : There is no re-through to lower margins on this business that I could derive just from that? Michael J. Ward : Right, that's correct. Keith Schoonmaker : And then a follow-up question on intermodal shift, I think the commentary in the quarterly report indicated automotive growth was constrained by customer transportation modal changes. Could you elaborate on that please? Michael J. Ward : In the early part of last year and the heavy freezes that were occurring some of the automakers pulled business off the rail and went to the haul away carriers, the haul away carriers would not take the business without contracts duration of around six months for obvious reasons and that's what you're seeing there. Keith Schoonmaker : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Justin Long with Stephens. Michael J. Ward : Good morning, Justin. Justin Long : Good morning and thanks. First question I had was on the service. With the locomotives coming on in the next couple of quarters and the service improvement being correlated to this additional power, as you mentioned Oscar, is the expectation that you can get back to normal service levels that we saw in 2013 by the end of the 2nd quarter absent any major weather event? Oscar Munoz : I think normal service levels, those were record service levels back then. I think we will gradually steam up to that area as the locomotives arrive and then it'll be gradual over the course of the year. Not quite ready to commit to those higher levels that quickly. Again we have a spring peak that goes from week nine to week 23, that's the end of June. So I think there will be some lagging effect but again I think you're going to see the efficiency, the productivity and of course the growth that we've seen altogether start to come together certainly by the second half of the year. Justin Long : Okay great. And second question I had was on pricing. I just want to get a better sense of how the pricing environment has improved and I was wondering if you can provide any more color on how recent renewals have been trending. Generally speaking I mean are you seeing something closer to the mid-single digits on renewals versus the 2.5% to 3% overall core pricing that you posted recently? Michael J. Ward : Justin my friend, David Baggs tells me numbers are not my friends. So I can't give you a specific number, but I would tell you that I am very pleased with the pricing that we're getting. It has been very positive and you will be very pleased when we report our numbers for the first quarter this year. Justin Long : Fair enough. I appreciate the time. I know it's been a long call. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners. Michael J. Ward : Good morning, Donald. Donald Broughton : Good morning. Clarence, it turns out mommas aren't supposed to let their babies grow to be truck drivers, I always thought it was cowboys but I am glad to learn that this morning. That said, a year ago on highway diesel and obviously that's not the price you all pay but average to $3.96 a gallon, looks like we're on course for it to average $3.10 a gallon or less in the first quarter this year. I know you're getting base yield and you're doing a great job there but just the fuel surcharge overall can you kindly give us some parameters, is the those absence of a fuel surcharge and a drop from what is essentially $4 a gallon to $3 a gallon or almost, is it 1% yield headwind, 2% yield headwind, 5% yield headwind, what does it represent for your overall book of business? Clarence W. Gooden: I don't think we have the math in front of us to do that. You do have the total fuel surcharge revenue that reported STB, that I also think is actually in our quarter flash. You can look at the total revenue from fuel and then you can model that out, I think you get a sense depending on different highway diesel prices what the impact would be. Donald Broughton : All right. I'll just back into it that way then. Thank you gentlemen. Clarence W. Gooden: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is from John Mims with FBR Capital Markets. Michael J. Ward : Good morning, John. John Mims : Hey, good morning. Thanks for slipping me in here. So a question on the chemical book. If you exclude crude oil and oil and gas comments for a minute and just look at some more traditional volumes, can you provide some color or just outlook on demand and pricing and contracting for your activities down in the Gulf and just your non-oil related volumes? Michael J. Ward : Yes. The other line of chemical business is growing about 2% to 3%. That's pretty much in line with what the chemical industry has been growing. Actually it\u2019s a little high on the plastics and growing at about 2% to 3% over what it\u2019s been for the last six or seven years. Pricing has been very good in the chemical side of the business, particularly in the renewals that have occurred in the fourth quarter and are in fact occurring in the first quarter. So we are very pleased with what we are getting in the pricing in those areas. Does that answer your question? John Mims : Yes, no, that\u2019s helpful. And what\u2019s the split between your traditional chemicals versus your oil and gas right now within that segment? Michael J. Ward: It\u2019s -- oil and gas is major part growing at that portfolio but the plastics part of the business is still the largest by far. John Mims : Is there a percentage you can give you mean I know you have put out numbers as far as what gas is for the total book, but just within chemicals? Michael J. Ward: I don\u2019t have it off the top of my head. John Mims : Okay, all right. I will just back to you some time. All right thanks a lot. The other questions have been answered. Michael J. Ward: Thank you everyone for your attention and we appreciate. See you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. You may disconnect your lines.",

As a reminder today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call all participants will be in a listen-only mode. For opening remarks and introduction I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. Sir, you may begin. David Baggs : Thank you and good morning everyone. And welcome again to CSX Corporation\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings presentation. The material that we'll be reviewing this morning along with our expanded quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our Web site this morning at csx.com under the Investor section. In addition, following the presentation a webcast and podcast replay will be available on that same Web site. This morning, our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition Oscar Munoz, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Clarence Gooden, our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer will be available during the question-and-answer session. Now before we turn the presentation over to Michael, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the Company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the Company\u2019s disclosure in the accompanying presentation on Slide 2. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition at the end of the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. With nearly 30 analysts covering CSX today, I would ask as a courtesy for everyone to please limit your inquiries to one primary and one follow-up question. And with that let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael? Michael Ward : Well, thank you David and good morning everyone. Yesterday CSX reported first quarter earnings per share of $0.45 up 13% from $0.40 reported in the same period last year. The Company also generated double-digit growth in operating income, net earnings and earnings per share. Revenue in the quarter was $3 billion with continuing broad based demand for freight transportation. We see better pricing vibrancy than in previous years and we\u2019re pursuing new growth opportunities in the merchandised and intermodal markets. These efforts are helping to offset the headwinds in coal the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower fuel recovery. In addition, lower fuel price and cost saving initiatives decreased expenses in the quarter. As a result, operating income increased 14% to $843 million and the operating ratio improved 330 basis points to 72.2. While operations remain stable sequentially during the quarter, we expect sustained improvements going forward driven by the combination of resource investments coming online, asset utilization adjustments and the extraordinary efforts of our employees. Specifically, we expect the positive trends we\u2019ve seen over the past few weeks to gain momentum in the second quarter and accelerate in the second half of the year as we progress towards the record levels of service we saw in 2012 and 2013. These efforts will drive our ability to continue pricing ahead of rail inflation, growing merchandised and intermodal faster than the economy and improving efficiency which is expected to produce savings approaching $200 million this year. With that foundation, we took action just yesterday to reward our shareholders with a 13% dividend increase and a new $2 billion share buyback program that we expect to complete over the next 24 months. Now, I will turn the presentation over to Fredrik who will take us through the top and bottom line results as well as our shareholder actions in more detail, Fredrik? Fredrik Eliasson : Thank you, Michael, and good morning everyone. Let me begin by providing some more detail on our first quarter results. Top line growth slowed in the first quarter with revenue slightly up versus the prior year and volume up 1%. These results reflect weaker market conditions in domestic coal a stronger U.S. dollar and the impact of winter weather which together suppress volume growth across the industry. Revenue per unit was flat in the first quarter and includes the impact of lower fuel surcharge revenue which declined $89 million versus the prior year. Core pricing for the quarter was 1.6% overall and 3.4% excluding coal. Other revenue increased $23 million versus the prior year driven mainly by higher liquidated damages. However, we incurred a similar year-over-year increase in train accident cost stemming from the Mount Carbon West Virginia derailment, which essentially offset the game in other revenue. Expenses decreased 4% versus last year driven primarily by the impact of lower fuel prices. Operating income was $843 million up 14% over $104 million versus the prior year. Looking below the line interest expense and other income were similar to the prior year period and income taxes were $261 million in the quarter, reflecting an effective tax rate of approximately 38%. Overall net earnings were $442 million and EPS was $0.45 per share up 11% and 13% respectively versus the prior year period. Now let me turn to the market outlook for the second quarter. Looking forward we expect a generally flat demand environment in the second quarter as we cycle the strong surge in pent-up demand during last year's second quarter then volume increased 8%. Overall we are projecting favorable conditions for 49% of our markets in the second quarter and stable to unfavorable conditions for the remaining 51%. We expect strong intermodal growth to continue as our strategic network investments support highway to rail conversions and growth with existing customers. Increased infrastructure development products are driving a favorable outlook for minerals. Agriculture is neutral as strengthened domestic grain shipment is offset by weakened export grain market resulting from the strong U.S. dollar. Automotive is expected to grow modestly driven by projected North American light vehicle production. The outlook for chemicals market is also neutral due to a reduction in drilling activities stemming from the low commodity price environment. As a result we expect crude volumes from the remainder of the year to hold relatively flat to the level we saw in the first quarter. We have sustained low natural gas prices under $3, domestic coal volumes was adversely impacted in the first quarter and we expect volume to decline in the second quarter and to be down at least 5% for the full year. Export coal volume is expected to be lower in the second quarter reflecting to oversupply and the strong U.S. dollar. While volumes have held up recently well in the first quarter, we still expect about 30 million tonnes for the full year. The strong U.S. dollar is particularly impacting the metals market where U.S. steel production is down 12% year-to-date. Overall the key drivers for a flat demand outlook in the second quarter or the change in commodity prices, the cycling of a period of strong pent-up demand during last year second quarter and a strengthening U.S. dollar. Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations from expenses in the second quarter. Beginning with Labor and Fringe, we expect second quarter average headcount to be essentially flat sequentially. On a year-over-year basis this represents a 3% increase driven by T&E employees added over the course of the last 12 months to support service. We expect second quarter labor inflation to be around $35 million similar to the level seen in the first quarter and then moderate to around $25 million dollars per quarter in the second half. As we saw in the prior quarters, there will be a $10 million to $50 million shift between the labor and MS&O expense lines in the second quarter as a result of the locomotive maintenance agreement we amended in June of 2014. This will be the last quarter that we are cycling this expense shift. Looking at MS&O expense, we expect the second quarter to be driven primarily by inflation and higher resource levels versus the prior year, partially offset by efficiency savings. Fuel expense in the second quarter will be driven predominantly by lower cost per gallon reflecting the current price environment and a continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the second quarter to increase around $10 million dollars versus the prior year reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. Finally equipment and other rents in the second quarter is expected to stay relatively flat to last year with higher freight car rates offset by improving cycle times. Turning to the next slide, as Michael mentioned, CSX will be increasing its dividend. The company will pay a dividend of $0.18 per share starting in the second quarter which represents a 13% increase. This build on 13 dividend increases we've made over the last 10 years and a 26% CAGR over that period and reflects the underlying strength in our core business. Our second quarter dividend increase will result in a payout ratio of 36% of trailing 12 months earnings. Going forward we're expanding our target payout range to 30% to 40% which reflects our confidence in the future earnings power of the company. In addition to the dividend increase CSX is also initiating a new share buyback program. CSX remains committed to utilizing share buybacks to return cash to investors, and as such we have announced a new $2 billion buyback program which is double the size of our previous program. We expect the program to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2017. This program will be conducted on a pro-rata basis during that period and is expected to be funded by debt, excess cash and free cash flow from the business. Going forward, we expect to sustain our current BBB +, BAA1 credit profile with balances our financial flexibility and cost of capital through the business cycle while targeting a debt to EBITDA ratio in the low 2s. Now let me wrap up on the next slide. Overall CSX delivered strong bottom line results in the first quarter and this is now a third consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth while top-line growth was lower than our initial expectations due to volume headwinds, productivity gains and improved pricing contributed to strong earnings growth this quarter. While we continue to see strength across many of our merchandise in intermodal markets headwinds in coal are not greater than we anticipated at the start of the year. Domestic coal volumes are being impacted by the low natural gas price environment and we now expect volumes to be down at least 5% this year. In addition, export coal continues to be challenged by soft global market conditions and we\u2019re maintaining our full year guidance of 30 million tonnes. Looking at the second quarter as we previously mentioned, we will be cycling a very strong demand environment from last year resulting in an overall flat volume outlook. In addition, since we do not expect to see the full benefits from the resources we\u2019re until later this year, we now project second quarter EPS to be flat to slightly up on a year-over-year basis. Looking at the full year 2015 earnings with our first quarter results being less robust than originally expected and with our new projections for the second quarter, double-digit EPS growth has clearly become more challenging. As a result, we\u2019re updating our guidance to mid to high single-digit EPS growth for the full year. While our growth expectations this year are diminished, we still expect to have a strong margin expansion by remaining focused on pricing above inflation, delivering efficiency savings approaching $200 million and driving a stronger service product for our customers. Bottom line CSX is committed to delivering full earnings potential of the business and maximizing value for shareholders. Our second quarter dividend increased and a new $2 billion buyback program reflects our confidence in the company\u2019s future. With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks. Michael Ward : Thank you, Fredrik. Before I begin my closing remarks on behalf of all CSX employees, I want to extend our heartfelt sympathies to the family, friends and colleagues of one of our employee who was fatally injured in the switching yard earlier this month. His death is a tragic reminder of why safety is and will remain our first and highest priority. Turning to our closing thoughts on the quarter, we continue our work to transform this railroad by consistently expanding the most diverse business mix in company history. We\u2019re investing growth markets, technology to improve safety, service and efficiency and innovative ways to collaborate with our customers. As we\u2019ve said the foundation of that transformation and those innovations is service excellence which creates value for our customers and enhances our ability to price above rail inflation grow merchandised and intermodal faster than the economy and improve efficiency and asset utilization. In short, these are the actions that will drive CSX to the mid 60s operating ratio. We are relentlessly focused on that goal and the shareholder actions we\u2019ve announced clearly underscore our confidence. CSX is committed to maximizing new opportunities as we continue our critical role in serving with a growing American population and expanding global supply chain all while creating sustainable value for you our shareholders. And now we will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Christian Wetherbee from Citi Research. Your line is now open sir. Christian Wetherbee : I was wondering if you maybe talk a little bit bigger picture about sort of the balancing of resources relative to the sort of the volume outlook, it seems from a volume perspective a little bit more of a sluggish sort of outlook for this year across the industry and as we\u2019re kind of recovering from a service perspective over the last year or so obviously you have more resources coming on board, taking a step back do you think sort of -- do you feel like the network is balanced enough or sort of when do you reach that point where you can kind of think a little bit more strategically about sort of the resources you bring on to network relative to the outlook of the volumes? Oscar Munoz : Christian, it\u2019s Oscar, it\u2019s probably appropriate for me to take that one since we do think a lot about that. And again I think a couple of things about how you think about with regards to the moderating volume forecast, we still have quite a strong baseline from the growth we had last year. So there is from an operational perspective quite a bit of work to do, so I\u2019ll have comment what happened to last year with that kind of growth, we are actually glad to be in a position where we may indeed have a slightly higher level of resources than we need. But again with the increased volatility we\u2019re facing and all the other issues, I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable with that. I might take the entire listening group to back to '09 where we did some extensive work around the sort of variability of the industry and certainly CSX and I think those facts and data there prove to be again rough order of magnitude of third of third of third where a third is relatively fixed and you really can\u2019t get out it other than our very long, long period of time. But two-thirds of that we bifurcated into sort of a short-term variable aspect which is immediate unit trains we can shutdown, but we kind of went through this long-term variable cost aspect of that where we can take steps and I think as we think about this very question and you hear about something like variable trains scheduling which is initiative we kicked off a month ago. That\u2019s part of a long-term variable cost adjustment that we\u2019re working through. So the obvious results or the obvious initiatives that we can take when volume moderates is we can put our locomotives into storage very quickly, we talked about that a couple of years ago, and certainly the furlough aspect is available to us, so we think about it, we think about it hard, we have some strategy around it. We do not see that coming into play over certainly the next couple of quarters with the kind of baseline growth we have from prior year. Christian Wetherbee : And then just when you think about sort of the longer term growth potential of the business, so we\u2019re now going to be I think about three years sort of in this mid to maybe high single-digit growth rate down from the double-digit expectations earlier this year. How do you think about sort of the longer term outlook for the business? Is it possible to ramp back up to double-digit EPS growth, or you think about things like coal, and sort of the overall volume environment is potentially being somewhat limiting to that ability. Fredrik Eliasson : This is Fredrik, I think that all depends on your assumption about coal, but I think you\u2019ve seen that we just have three quarters in a row where we had double-digit earnings growth though we think that it is certainly possible for us to do that, it just depends on how much the headwind is on coal. We\u2019ve had three years of very significant headwinds in coal that clearly has impacted our earnings growth, but at some point we believe that\u2019ll moderate and when it does we do feel that what we have lined out in terms of our inflation, plus pricing continue to drive productivity in excess of 130, 150 a year and continued to grow with economy as the markets allow. I think we have an opportunity to continue to get back to very strong earnings growth going forward. Operator : Thank you. And our next question here comes from Tom Wadewitz, UBS. Your line is now open sir. Tom Wadewitz : Want to ask you, I guess just start with a question on utility coal. Fredrik I think you said 5% or more decline in utility, I think that\u2019s been your comment for the last, I don\u2019t know six weeks or so. Can you give us a little more color in terms of where you think stockpiles are at in the south and in the northern parts of your network? And how much I guess visibility you have to that being down five -- five sounds like potentially an optimistic number given where natural gas prices are. So just wondered if you give a little more color on the kind of utility coal picture and then maybe rest of that 5% decline. Clarence Gooden : Tom, this is Clarence, the stockpiles in the north and the south are both well above the target levels and that\u2019s particularly true when you take the reduced burns that are rates that are into account. In March the stockpiles were about 85 days at the current burn rates in the north and about 180 days in the south. Tom Wadewitz : I mean if stockpiles are that high, I would guess your normal target is something like what 60 or 65 days or maybe. Clarence Gooden : It varies in the north versus in the south and you\u2019re right about 65 days in the north, it\u2019s a little bit higher than that in the south but not much. Tom Wadewitz : So if the stockpiles are that high and natural gas prices are as low as they are. Do you think there's risk that your utility coal is down quite a bit harder than 5%? Clarence Gooden : There's some risk that it's slightly down more than 5%. Depends on what the weather conditions will be this summer, we're hoping they're going to be hot. Fredrik Eliasson : And Tom just to clarify, this is Fredrik, what we've said it's at least 5% to put a lower level or a higher level on it, depending how you look at it. Tom Wadewitz : And then on liquidated damages, can you just give us a rough sense of how to forecast that the next couple of quarters, that was obviously a little higher than we thought in the first quarter. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure Tom. I think that for the rest of the year at least based on the visibility we have today we don't expect any material liquidated damages. Tom Wadewitz : So flat, year-over-year for other revenue or\u2026 Fredrik Eliasson : If we just look at each quarter I don't think it's going to be more than $5 million to $10 million if that, in terms of absolute amount. Tom Wadewitz : 5 million to 10 million. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alison Landry from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Alison Landry : I wanted to actually ask about how we should be thinking about the progression of coal yields for the balance of the year, and is there a possibility that RPU could be up in spite of fuel and sort of the things that I'm thinking about are lapping of the export coal rate concessions which I believe happens in 2Q, correct me if I'm wrong. And then thinking about the new fixed variable contract structure on a meaningful portion of the domestic book with volume declines, I would expect the yields to rise on that. Am I thinking about that correctly, what are some of the other factors that would move that up or down? Fredrik Eliasson : This is Fredrik, I'll start with then I'll let Clarence add any thoughts there. I think that from a fuel perspective I think you're going to continue to see pressure in the remaining three quarters of the year. We benefitted a little bit here in the first quarter from the lag, so you're going to continue to see that impact in RPU for the full year, at least based on where we're seeing fuel today and probably more so than we saw in the first quarter. You were right that as we get through the second quarter we are lapping the decreases that we took last year for export coal and that should be beneficial as we get to the second half, And I always point our investors to looking at the same-store sale, that\u2019s where we provided there because I think that\u2019s a much more meaningful number to look at because that gives you true indications what\u2019s going on from a pricing perspective, and with the fuel surcharge mechanism that is designed to make us neutral to fuel price volatility with exception of lag. I think when you look at that perspective I think that gives you more better view of it, but fuel surcharge revenue will be low and it will year-over-year it is going to impact the yields negatively throughout the year. Alison Landry : But you don\u2019t think that lapping of the sort of concessions and then with the fixed variables structure if volumes are down then yields theoretically should be up that\u2019s not enough to offset the fuel decline in other words? Fredrik Eliasson : I think it will be helpful but I am not sure it\u2019s going to be enough to offset the impact we\u2019re seeing from fuel. Alison Landry : And then just a follow-up question based on some of the numbers you gave in the release it looks like the productivity gains in the quarter were around 18 million. Should we expect to step up in the second quarter or would you say that the bulk of roughly 200 million is expected to be realized in the second half as service is restored? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, so if you look at the different line items in our quarterly flash, you will see that if you added up between labor, MS&O and fuel that it was about $38 million in the quarter. In total and that is obviously the first quarter of our target to get to something that approaches $200 million for the year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Salmon, Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open, sir. Rob Salmon : Very strong performance with regard to the core price increases, could you give us a sense in terms of the expectation and the cadence as we look out through the remainder of the year, have we kind of experienced kind of the full benefit of those stronger pricing increase in the first quarter or can we potentially see a step up as we look out through the duration of the year particularly in intermodal? Clarence Gooden : No, Rob, this is Clarence; I think you can expect to continue to see our pricing increase. I think we've mentioned in the fourth quarter that we had begun fairly aggressive pricing earlier in the year. Our third quarter same-store sales pricing in our merchandise area was 2.5 in the fourth it was 2.7. In this quarter as you saw it was 3.4, so I think you can continue to see a continual increase in our same-store sales pricing and in our business as we move throughout 2015. Rob Salmon : But that's really helpful. I guess Clarence I think you had mentioned about the little bit -- speaking little bit more positively about the potential for international intermodal conversions over to East. Could you give us your updated thoughts in terms of what that opportunity is looking like for kind of '15 and then as well as longer term perspective? Clarence Gooden : I think the water is little muddy and unclear given the situation is and ongoing is in the West. I continue to believe that there will be diversions to the Gulf in the East Coast as more and more customers get comfortable with what is going to finally emerge with the canal and with the post West Coast strike. It's just too early to see how that's going to settle out and as you know there is a lot of congestion up and down in the East Coast so that's going have to settle down for people to make decisions, but I think you'll see more than what even we had anticipated seeing as time moves on over the course of the next couple of years. Operator : Thank you. And now our next question comes from Thomas Kim, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Thomas Kim : I had a couple of questions just with regard to the near-term guidance, with your 2Q EPS is that including buybacks? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, that is in all view, yes. Thomas Kim : And then with regard to the outlook for the year, does your guidance assume the fuel prices increase as a forward curve would imply? Fredrik Eliasson : I think we've just included whatever the forward curve currently is that we're seeing out there. I don't think it's a significant difference from what we're seeing right now, but yes whatever the forward curve dictates. Operator : And our next question comes from Ken Hoexter, Merrill Lynch. Ken Hoexter : Can you clarify the other revenues, is that $5 million to $10 million comment from other revenues from liquidated damages, is that a change or year-over-year increase of 5 million to 10 million or you're only looking for 5 million to 10 million from now on, on the entire other revenue line? Fredrik Eliasson : Ken, and I think I've heard at the beginning of you question, so I'll just to make clear. On liquidated damages what we are expecting for the rest of the year, if I look at the each quarter it looks like it's going to be somewhere between $5 million and $10 million of absolute amount of liquidated damages not year-over-year. Ken Hoexter : And then just on, looking at operations Oscar, the on time originations is fallen a 50% arrivals down to 41%. Kind of all the way back to the start of the one plan here going back to 2005. Can you kind of just talk through what's going on, what needs to happen, why we're not seeing maybe even a more negative impact on that from operations or cost side, and what needs to swing back into the positive on that. Oscar Munoz : I think it's what we've been saying for the last almost year, the amount of growth that came on to our very structured and disciplined one plan was the only missing part was the amount of resources in order to run it. And I think we've been fairly consistent with saying, as those resources arrived well trained and well manufactured we can put them to good use and start to spin again and that's exactly what's been happening over the last month along with our own initiatives and the efforts of our employees. And so the -- the really last saving kind of grace is this locomotives arrival that are beginning to trickle in here, some in the first quarter and second quarter. That's the big factor in the whole business and I think again we've been consistent with this second quarter being sort of the vital point and then the increasing level of service that we'll get in the back half of the year and then again trying to approach the record levels we had just a couple of years ago. Ken Hoexter : So the crew basis where you think it should be now, is that correct? Oscar Munoz : Literally we've got 400 people here in the first quarter that came out, we'll have another 400 to 500 that come out here in the next three months and then it tapers off. And so, resources from a crew perspective I'd say other than a couple of spot areas we're in very-very good shape and that's caught up and that's been a six to nine month sort of initiative to get those folks well trained and ready to work. Ken Hoexter : So just to clarify then on maybe the cost per employee, do we see that ramp up or is that at the levels you want it now? Oscar Munoz : I think it's essentially at the level, we'll have a few more people coming in here in the second quarter, some of it is for attrition but some of it's for a specific areas of shortage and in terms of the cost per employee I think to some degree over time we expect the cost of employee to come down, because right now we're working in a very elevated level of overtime and so the cost of employee should over time moderate from where we are right now and have been for the last few quarters. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Bill Greene, Morgan Stanley. Bill Greene : Oscar and Michael I know you sort of are aware of this and we look at the eastern rails, the margins have sort of moved towards the lower end of the group. And I'm curious your thoughts on, I realize there's a priority of things we have to do so coal has been a challenge recently and we want to get the service right. But when do you sort of come back and say, let's take pen to paper here and let's really figure out how we're going to get the costs out, because coal may never come back and while the pricing can accelerate maybe there's a lot more we can do on costs. How do you think about 2016 or '17 or even longer term about addressing that and getting you guys back toward these long-term targets, mid 60s, try to accelerate that as best you can. How do you think about doing that from a cost standpoint? Michael Ward : This is Michael, and I think you're quite right, so, I guess as we look forward the coal has been a challenge to both the eastern roads. And I think as we look forward it's about how do we grow the other businesses intermodal or merchandize above the rate of the general economy which we have been doing. Price above inflation which, that is actually accelerating and start getting new cost out and as you know we targeted $200 million this year and we think the combination of those three, some modest growth, pricing above inflation and good cost discipline and efficiency will drive us towards those mid 60s. Oscar Munoz : And Bill I would add at the trailing part of your question you specifically mentioned how that relates to cost and I think Michael's concept is a great one, it's not just about one thing, it's about pulling all the levers we pull historically, but specifically to address the cost aspect of it. It's the normal productivity we've been able to achieve plus some and so the plus some is initiatives and objectives that probably sort of border on more innovative and potentially in the world of rail roading a little bit more risky people think. So these variable scheduling thing that we've done, I mean as you read the press about that, half the people are supportive and the other half are oh my god, they're going to tank the whole place by doing all this crazy stuff. You got to understand the things that we do we think through very thoroughly, we plan through it and we'll communicate to our folks and that particular program right now is just really, it's freed up 50 locomotives in a month. Our metrics are starting to go up for a lot of different reasons but including that. But I guess my point on the cost side is it's an efficiency play it's not just necessarily a wholesale reduction in people. Efficiency creates productivity and productivity creates the economic value that you're coming. So pull all the levers, the cost one's a big one, the rate that we're increasing this year is probably a rate that we'll keep thinking about in the next future years to get to that mid 60s. Bill Greene : And when we think about the challenge that occurred in 2014, partially that was weather but partially significant growth in volume and then as we look at what you've just sort of walked me through here, the volume aspect of it, it would almost seem to me that the more profitable way to do it would be to focus on both price and productivity. Volumes can do what they'll do but growing faster than the economy actually would seem to make it more difficult to solve the service issue. Am I missing a piece of that? Oscar Munoz : Yes, in a way, because when we talk about growing faster the economy you may remember last year the second quarter we surged 8%. We don't do surge as well we do 2% to 3% growth very well. So, our hope is that we can modestly grow at a little bit above the inflation. We can adjust to that kind of growth there is just surges we don't do well Bill. But I agree with you it's clear to the pricing and productivity are more under our control and obviously we are going to focus intensely on those, but we do think that third equation, some growth above inflation will create shareholder value. Bill Greene : And just one point of clarification on that last point, does the growth above inflation require higher levels of CapEx or you are at where you need to be? Oscar Munoz : I think the 16% to 17 % we have been at, historically will take care of it going forward. Operator : Thank you. Now our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : So, Michael or Oscar this is -- kind to be the third or fourth year now when we've taken guidance down and yet your lead off the release last night with the $2 billion buyback. So can you put in context, what the board is thinking and up in the buyback right now, in the midst of what seems to be another challenging year for all the reasons we've discussed on this call. Michael Ward : Brandon I think, we've all along thought that the best way to create shareholder values are balanced approach to capital deployment and cash deployment, so we are going to spend $2.5 billion this year, 17% above revenues investing for growth in the future. Secondly, this increase on our dividend takes us a little bit above a 2% yield which some of our shareholders value that dividend, we think we want to be a little bit above the average for the S&P 500 and the share buybacks the 2 billion we think it helps those shareholders alike buybacks, so we think that balance deployment of doing all three, really is the best way to create shareholder value as we've done over the past decade. So I don't view this is very different than what we have been doing and a way to create a strong shareholder value going forward. Oscar Munoz : And Brendon, this is Oscar, you kind of ask how does the board think about it, so being a board member on different place than here out our company the way board members think about it, any time you project sort of forward things like this, they're based on a base line of financial strength and economic viewpoint that there is growth and strength in this business and in this particular company that can actually pay for that, so it's a very thorough review processes, it's not something that gets done very lightly. So we have a lot of potential for growth, we weathered a significant storm here over the last few months, and I know it's hard to go back to it but you lose that kind of volume stream and revenue stream and operating profit strength and make it up and stay even. That's the strength of our business, now we got to build upon that and clearly our board sees that benefit has approved the initiatives that we've opened up here with. Brandon Oglenski : And I guess to follow up on Bill Green's question on margins, there is other U.S. carriers that do have 20% of their revenue exposure in coal, they haven't had great outcomes either on the volume side, and growth hasn't been right for the industry for the last 10 years. And yet, we've seen a lot of margin traction on price and productivity. I know that\u2019s part of your plan. But what is changing in the forward outlook for CSX that suggest we are going to get significant margin expansion beyond just the fuel contribution in 2016 or 2017, that I assume took to the board and said it doesn't make the shares relatively attractive at this point in time. And are you willing to put out a long-term margin target like you did I think back in 2010 or 2011 when we said we are going to be at a 65 OR by 2015. Oscar Munoz : On the first part of your question about the margin expansion, I think if you look at the underlying business that we have, that has actually been expanding over last couple of years, but the headwind from almost a billion dollars loss of coal has offset that. So we are comfortable, when we look at the underlying core earnings part of our company, that it's clearly capable of continuing to expand margin over time similar to what you have heard earlier. In terms of setting a target out there and so forth, I think what we have said before and I think you know in 2011 we set a target for 2015 of mid 60s and with the exception of what happened in our coal business that is clearly outside of our control, we would have been there. What I've said repeatedly has been, that I think what we need to do right now is to establish some progress here and hopefully we will do that this year of sustained margin expansion and some earnings growth, and hence once we have that track record behind us, I think we can step back and say are we comfortable now to put another target out there. But I think right now our focus is margin expansion this year, and continued earnings growth. Operator : And our next question here comes from Brian Ossenbeck, JP Morgan. Brian Ossenbeck : So you mentioned that frac sand volumes were down in the first quarter and highlighted the reduced energy related drilling activities. Would you expect kind of similar decline in the second quarter from sands or will it accelerate up with the rest of the year as the E&P is kind of picking there the CapEx plans. And can you also just give us a mix of the basins that you'll serve again as a reminder. Clarence Gooden : And what was your last part in your question, a mix of what? Brian Ossenbeck : The basins, the shale basins that you served, just so we have a sense of where the sand is going? Clarence Gooden : Our frac business was down about 10% in the first quarter, we will see numbers may be similar to that in the second quarter, it's probably a little too soon for us to speculate on that for the rest of the year because one of the formations that we serve which is both the Marcellus and underneath that the Utica is a different type of formation and in fact the deals in a lot of wet gases as oppose to oil type formations, and so some of the fracking has continued into those areas. And we also are shipping frac to some of the other formations that are not as active and our volumes that we shift to those formations are not in the quantities that other rail carriers are shipping to those formations and those formations are western formation. What was the first part of your question involving crude? Brian Ossenbeck : I think that basically covered it, but if you want to I guess give an update on crude given, potentially some of the more safety issues, the tank car standards which we'll probably see in the next month and so, any further initiatives on track inspections, if you can kind of bring us up to the current operating environment that would be helpful. Oscar Munoz : This is Oscar. I think what you hear and read is very accurate, our process of attempting and to prevent any of the accidents through inspections and a host of other initiatives continues to be a very-very strong initiative not just at CSX but across the industry and to some degree had a very strong alliance with the petroleum producers. On a tank car standards, we are very anxious to have that standard out there. It's going to take some time to get those cars of this systems, so as sooner the government can release those standards that we can begin to manufacture those I think will be critical, because I think on the mitigation of when night a incident happens, that car and that standard of car is going to be very-very helpful in that process, so we look forward to the government's decision on that. Brian Ossenbeck : And just quick one on intermodal. You mentioned that the West Coast congestion was impacting East Coast volumes. Can you give us an update just how that improves or may be it hasn't since the labor negotiations have settled there, so may be what's going on in March and in early April? And then, also when you think about East Coast taking potential share, is there is a lot of infrastructure expansion that needs to be done at those ports or on a CSX network to potentially handle some of that when it does start to land on-shore. Clarence Gooden : Brian I am certainly not as good an expert on the West Coast as a Western rail carrier is going to be of on answering your questions on the West Coast, I would tell you that it's better today that it was yesterday and it was better yesterday, obviously then it was few weeks ago, but they have certain amount of congestion on the West Coast and a certain amount of backup still exists on the West Coast that is going to take a few more weeks ahead of us to get straight. And regards to the East Coast, we still have congestion on a lot of ports on the East Coast. There is going to be a requirement for lot of infrastructure improvement on the East Coast to handle the larger vessels, the deeper water requirements that are going to be required for the larger ships and that's going to take place over the next several years. Lot of ports that you are aware, already have plans in place to do that. Some have plans but no financing in place to do that. And then of course there is going to be a need to have a lot more infrastructure on the land side that support the ports themselves to be able to handle the type of volumes that come into that. We shortly think that the rails, both Eastern rails who play a big part in what happens in the rail infrastructure that serves the ports. So, I think it's still a couple of years away of being able to see how it will finally shake out on how the infrastructures that's needed to support that growth on the east occurs and exactly where on the East Coast that growth occurs. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt Troy, Nomura Securities. Your line is now open. Matt Troy : I wanted to talk about the variables you can identify with some specificity in coal specifically was curious if you have any updated thoughts on your internal work or studies you may have commissioned about what kind of capacity be it tonnage be it volume may be coming offline in 2015 over the next three year period as some of these older coal fired plants are required to shut down. Is there a tonnage at risk number or business at risk number you've developed internally that might help us kind of understand at least what that baseline number might be away from the variables that are harder to predict that are more tied to things like nat gas and other things. Fedrik Eliasson : I think what we have said. This is Fedrik. I think what we have said in the past is as we looked at 2015 we identified about 4 million tonnes that removed in 2013 that will going to be impacted by the MATS or Casper rules and then beyond that, we had another 3 million tonnes that we moved in '13 that were going to be falling out in '16 and '17. I think that's our best estimate for impacts from those regulations. I mean in longer terms we have to understand and better study and see what ultimately comes out of the proposed CO2 regulation. Clarence Gooden : That's true, but now you also need to be ware there is a lot of capacity at the remaining plants that will be able to pick up a lot of that slack that as it comes out of that system, so it's not as if you know the capacity in total goes away. Matt Troy : Understood, I just wanted to double check and make sure that there hadn't been change in light of some of the pricing in gas and differentials there. I guess the second question a follow-up would be simply with gas now down taking to 250 range, what's your sense as you look across your customer base the potential impact from switching, is it fully felt at this point and can't get much worse or if we take another $0.25 to $0.50 down and hit that reach a historical low, is there an added or incremental hit to the coal business to those utilities that at that point becomes just too compelling not to switch to gas or are we feeling the full effect now? Clearance Gooden : I think all the utilities that can switch to gas as the low rates are switching gas have already switched to gas that could conceivably do it, number one. I think number two when you start seeing gas prices get into those type ranges the utilities themselves get nervous about that because what utilities look for is stability not for extreme price changes or price ranges. Operator : And our next question comes from Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Ben Hartford : I just wanted to get some context to your demand outlook here in the second quarter you talked about the flat volumes year-over-year, I assume that's all and if so given the coal headwind and anticipated declines in the second quarter would suggest a fairly healthy and above seasonal ramp through the quarter comparable to what we saw a year ago. And I am wondering what you're anticipating as it relates to the sequential improvement in volumes on the merchandised and the intermodal side, will it look like 2Q 2014 and what are your customers saying as it relates to some of the pent-up demand in the context of what we experienced a year ago, some perspective there would be helpful? Clearance Gooden : This is Clearance. I think our view was on the slide that you saw there, towards the end of the presentation where that in 49% almost half of our markets we saw it is very favorable in the food and consumer, intermodal, minerals and waste and equipment markets and neutral in about 22% of the market. So our ag products we still have a large carryout from the last year's crop. And in fact one of the largest that we have ever recorded in the United States. The South American soybean crop in particular is strong this year and given the fact that we have a strong U.S. dollar, it's impacting our U.S's ability to export soybeans. We still have by historical standards a fairly strong export. Automotive on a year-over-year basis essentially be flat with North American light vehicle production at 17.4 this year versus 17 last year, still a large year by historical standards one of the largest since 2000, but flat on the year-over-year basis. Our chemical business the chemical side of it being relatively flat but with petroleum products still being up, it will be a flat year in a year-over-year basis but flat at a high level and where we're down is in some of the bulk commodities the coal, export coal some of the ForEx products, some metals which as Michael pointed out yesterday on CNBC are being heavily influenced by the imports coming into this country. Steel consumption is very high in the country but U.S. mill utilization is not high in the country. And by our phosphates and fertilizers that are due to both high inventories and a strong U.S. dollar that\u2019s allowing some imports into the country. So while we're seeing flat, it's flat at a very high level. Ben Hartford : And I guess you pointed to that slide if we look at that same slide from a year ago, you had 83% of the volume in the favorable category now at 49 which just to react to that, it doesn't seem as though you have the same type of favorable pent-up demand bias here in the second quarter of '15 as you might have had in 2014 and so you won't have the same degree of seasonal improvement in 2Q '15 as you might have had a year ago, as weather improves and as we work through some of these port congestion issues, is that fair? Clarence Gooden : That's fair. We won't see the surge that Michael spoke about. Operator : And now our next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne, TD Securities. Your line is now open. Cherilyn Radbourne : Just one question for me and it's on price and I guess what I am wondering is one of the reasons that pricing has been accelerating and expected to continue to accelerate has been that capacity has been tight across the transportation industry. And I am just wondering now that volumes are coming in a bit slower than expected, can you just address whether you think capacity is still tight enough to support the kind of increases that you've been expecting? Clearance Gooden : This is Clearance. Yes, we still see capacity as been very tight. For example housing is still robust and that's positive for us. If you notice our minerals business was I think around 11% or so based on a lot of highway infrastructure, projects going on particularly in the region and country that we serve, so we're seeing truck capacity staying relatively tight. Coast wise barges have been very strong and strong demand, so we still see capacity fairly tight and we still see a strong need for transportation, pricing does seem to be very robust if you look at the spot truck load market it is remaining fairly strong. So we see that it's still a very strong, robust pricing environment. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Vernon, Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open. David Vernon : Maybe Fredrik or Oscar, a question for you on the network itself, with respect to the coal business becoming a little bit lower density are there any opportunities to create efficiency by rationalizing some of that what is now lower density pieces of track or is it too integrated into the network to make that type of cost action feasible? Oscar Munoz : This is Oscar, we took a lot of those actions clearly when we first started to see the coal declines, and it's one of our more variable cost structure businesses as coal is, and so as that volume sort of decreased we are able to decrease the train starts fairly quickly. The infrastructure is a little bit more difficult, it is part of a broader network and the way the -- sort of the rules of the land work is if you run a certain amount of tonnage it has to be maintained at a certain level. And we've not really gotten down our tonnage in those routes much below what we, what would constitute a large reduction in sort of the capital reinvestment and maintenance that's required. So we\u2019ve done a lot, we'll continue to manage and monitor that, but it is a little bit of integrated into the network as you suggest. David Vernon : And then maybe just as a quick follow up, could you give us an update on the Virginia Avenue tunnel and when the double stocking there is going to be cleared? And if you guys have tried to figure out what kind of impact that could have on the intermodal profitability? Michael Ward : Well, we're really pleased there was a group that was trying to have an injunction against us proceeding and fortunately the federal court in DC denied that injunction request last week which allows to commence with the construction. We got a few permits we have to get which we think will come pretty quickly. We think the first tunnel will be done within 18 months and that both tunnels will be done within a three year timeframe. So that is the last piece of our national gateway, obviously that dramatically improves the economics out of the Mid-Atlantic ports because we can then double stack versus single stack, so great increase in our efficiency and our ability to move the traffic, so we're very excited. It's been a long process, we've been at it for five years now and looks like we're finally going to start moving some dirt and get this thing moving. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from John Larkin, Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is now open. John Larkin : Clarence you laid out a pretty attractive ramp in same-store sales pricing growth starting with the third quarter all the way through the first quarter, you said that would continue and when you said it would continue did that imply that it would sort of level off at somewhere between 3% and 4% or do you see the potential for that to go higher, part number one. Part number two, given that you have 3% more people working on the railroad to provide a service, you've got some inflation embedded in the labor contracts. How high does that number need to be to absorb the 3% more labor and what I'll call rail inflation? Are you more than covering that with the 3.4 or do you need a little bit more. Cherilyn Radbourne : On the first part of that question John, I think we have the potential, not the potential -- we will take that number higher each sequential quarter going forward. I don't know how to be any more emphatic and straight forward than that. John Larkin : Fredrik or Oscar would you comment on the second half of the question? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes John, and my job is to not let those increased resources and costs sit idly by and we create efficiency that way so that again we maximize where we can get on the top-line with that increasing margin story on the bottom-line. John Larkin : So there'll be plenty there to derive some margin expansion. And then secondly as a follow on, I did read an article yesterday that talked about some of the operational changes that are going on within the company. And I've seen this before but there was some discussion of running what used to be a daily train every 28 hours, so that you ended up running six trains where there were seven per week in the past. From an operational point of view how is that working out? Are you seeing the savings that you hope to see and has there been any degradation in service as a result of this? Oscar Munoz : John, it's Oscar, and I I've thrown it out a couple of times over the course of the calls, the early returns are great, it's part of our merchandise network is about a 100 trains that we're working through this. And frankly we've seen an immediate reduction certainly in a crew starts and addition to the train length that we're gaining. We've also freed up about 50 locomotives and the operating measures that we sort of work through from train to ultra power to just velocity and dwell, actually have followed positively. Now certainly milder weather has helped, little bit of volume reduction has helped up. So we don't want to attribute it all to that but we're very encouraged by the early signs of this. And with regards to any potential concerns I think one of the things you worry about, about running less trains in a given week is that you start sort of messing with your flow through in your terminals and yards. And we've not seen that anywhere significantly. So at this point again I have good month into what we've seen all the great positive results and very little degradation and the other measures, so we'll continue that for the near future. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Bascome Majors : Just curious where do you think you might be on the OR without the almost 1 billion loss in coal that you've seeing since 2011? Fredrik Eliasson : This is Fredrik. I think that obviously some other assumptions goes into the two, but if you take 1 billion and add it back and the appropriate margin on that I think you're pretty close right around that 65 which we had originally outlined to be at, at this point. Bascome Majors : And into follow up on that presumably the profitability on what's left in coal is certainly decline from that period both because of the export cuts but the lower utility volumes on the network. Could you refresh us directionally speaking on where the margins in your segments sit by segment from both an absolute standpoint and the incremental margins you see on volume growth here? Fredrik Eliasson : Well so I think we've said publically before that if you look at our business overall across the 10 or 11 markets, I think coal because of its very -- the way that we operate coal has always been the top end of the margin, also chemicals because of the risk profile. I think those two and I think the good is rest of our business is very homogenous in terms of the contribution to the bottom line that we generally look at this from a long-term economic perspective including asset recovery charges. Incrementality is a little different depending on whether its unit train versus batch, clearly we're very -- we think that the intermodal margins from an incremental perspective is very attractive as is adding stuff to the batch network to schedule network as well. And then obviously when you add unit trains that does require additional resources wholesale to move that unit train. So overall I would say that we feel good about what we're in terms of contribution clearly the coal is still at the high end and as is chemicals because of its risk profile. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Jeff Kauffman : I wanted to focus a little bit on the operating metrics that may accompany service improvement if you're able to hit your goals and targets here. I guess question one is it as simple as locomotives or are we going to require stronger infrastructure in the track whether it's sidings or double track or extra track? And then I guess secondly, if we look at some of the key operating metrics such as average systems speed, dwell time. Where do you believe if you're successful these metrics can be by the fall and kind of should be within say 12 to 24 months? And what does that do for you in terms of equipment utilization or ability to grow without incurring incremental cost? Oscar Munoz : Jeff, it's Oscar. With regards to sort of locomotives versus infrastructure, I think we've done and again we've talked about over the course of the year all the infrastructure investments that we've made different routing protocols, different interchange points. All of that by enlarge has been invested with regards to the volume we've seen. So we've worked through that part fairly quickly. On the crew side we've been hiring madly and those folks have gone -- right it gets down to the locomotive space. Long-term from a strategic perspective there is always issues around infrastructure siding as we've run longer trains for instance, some technology to get our hump yards a little bit faster and quicker with the merchandised train that's mixed that\u2019s got to be obviously worked. But for right now it is a big issue around locomotives which is why there is variable train thing, freeing up 50 locomotives is a very important part of our initiatives. I think as you think with regards to our operating metrics that you see as you know those are very top-line. There is many, many metrics that we watch inside the company but all-in I think what we've said is that they'll continue to progress forward in the near-term to certainly get above prior year that's our first goal. And then as we progress longer term you said 12 to 24 months, I think inching up to again to a record year we had back in 2013 and that is always going to be sort of our goal over the long-term. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Scott Group : So flat to slight earnings growth in the second quarter comps get tougher in the back half of the year just on a year-over-year basis. What are the offset? What's the offset there? Where you think you see an acceleration in earnings growth in the second half? Fredrik Eliasson : Well, I think as we outlined before, the number one priority right now for us is to restore or put the service back to where it needs to be in order to be able to get the assets fluidity that we've been lacking here for essentially five quarters, and as that happens we know that there is a lot of embedded cost that will come out. You also heard Clarence talk about where we are from a pricing and the fact that we expect an increased pricing. So it's really about pulling those two levers harder and the foundation in order to be able to do that is getting the service level back to where it needs to be because we know a lot of good things happened from that. It's not as I think you're implying in your answer as much of a volume story right now, because the fact that we're cycling for the rest of the year frankly very strong volumes, so it is pricing and it is productivity. Scott Group : And then other revenue, what was the drop in the adjustments to revenue reserves and is that kind of a one-time thing or is there any ongoing impact there. And then I know it's early but is there any way to think about liquidated damages in '16 if coal is down a lot this year, do they go up or at some point I'm guessing they need to all come down but I'm not sure if that's in '16. Fredrik Eliasson : So taking your last part of your question first, I think it's a little too early to think about that, I think we'll have to see where volumes come out before that. But I don't expect as much liquidated damages in '16 or '17 as we've seen over the last couple of years, but we will have a better view of that as we get closer to that year. In terms of the other revenue that's simply just a reflection of the fact that the network slowed down in the first quarter and we have something called in transit reserve and the biggest factor of that decline in supplemental revenue was because of that. So as the network, at a very level of network slows down, you have more of your cargo on the network when you end the quarter and therefore you have more in reserve to reflect that and the network improves it actually comes out the other way so that's essentially all it is. Scott Group : So we shouldn't have that as a negative impact in the future quarters as the comps. Fredrik Eliasson : No, you should not. Operator : And our next question comes from Jason Seidl, Cowen and Company. Your line is now open, sir. Jason Seidl : Two quick questions, one Clarence getting back to intermodal and obviously some of the shifting has gone on with the West Coast issues, how should we think about yields as some of the freight may move back to the West Coast on the intermodal product. Clarence Gooden : I would expect that if it moves entirely back, you're talking about international traffic on a transcon basis? Jason Seidl : Yes. Clarence Gooden : I would expect the yields to improve to go up. Jason Seidl : And I guess my follow up question. The STB reauthorization bill that's out there, Michael I was wondering if you had any thoughts about that and what are the potential impacts you know that might come on to the rail industry. Michael Ward : Jason, we're actually supportive of that bill, we think that it strikes a good balance between some of the things some of our customers we'll like to see and also our need to continue to make sufficient money to reinvest in this business, so we're supportive of it, of course you don't like everything in every bill but I think all in all it\u2019s a good balance and we're hopeful that the House who is generally supportive of the rail industry would take up similar legislation. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Cleo Zagrean, Macquarie Capital. Cleo Zagrean : Both of my questions relate to pricing and the first one is on coal. Could you please share some insight into same-store price for coal excluding fuel in the quarter? And your thoughts on the outlook for pricing given volume challenges for each of domestic and exports and if you envisage taking some action there if the volume drop should be stronger than 5%? Thank you for the domestic utilities. Clarence Gooden : So the first part of your question was same-store sales for pricing coals? Cleo Zagrean : I am trying to get a sense for pricing ex the fuel noise in the quarter for coal. Fredrik Eliasson : This is Fred, just to clarify, so our same-store sales that we publish excludes the impact of fuel and there are two numbers that we show in there, one is the overall pricing same-store sales and one is the ex coal. So implied in that is that if you look at the delta I think you can get a sense of what the same-store sales is for coal. So that makes sense? Cleo Zagrean : I thought somehow fuel was in the same-store impact. And then the second question, with a strong focus on pricing that we're hearing from you. Should we expect to see a trade-off in volume growth against the potentially softer spend from peers and maybe continue the adjustment in network resources in response to a more moderate volume growth scenario? Clarence Gooden : I don't think so necessarily, I think that the value that we're offering our customers, I think at the service levels that we have that are improving, I think given the fact that capacity particularly on the truck side of the business is and with the highway congestion with the driver issues that our customers are facing, with the overall value proposition that rail is offering. I think that our pricing and the value that we're offering I think we can retain the volumes that we have and continue to grow and expand our business. And I think when you see it for example in this quarter, our pricing and same-store sales and our merchandise which includes our intermodal being at the 3.4 and the fact that our domestic intermodal grew at 9% supports that theory. Operator : And our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Your line is now open. Keith Schoonmaker : Thanks a quick follow-on to that comment Clarence, concerning a strong domestic intermodal volume growth. You said this drivers both highly conversion in growth with new customers. Would you estimate what portion of recent growth stems from each? Clarence Gooden : Well, I really don't know from the standpoint of new customers because we use multiple channels of sales and it would be difficult to define what some of those new customers are, but I would tell you that a large portion of that's been the result of a couple of programs we have both with beneficial cargo owners as well as our highway to rail conversion programs that we have in our intermodal product, and it has been I think extremely -- both programs have been extremely successful programs that we've had. Keith Schoonmaker : And then a quick question on coal pricing, you've mentioned the negative impact of both export rate pressure and of fixed variable contracts in the period domestic. Was export by far the most powerful influence or were these factors similarly and significant would you say in the period? Clarence Gooden : I would say both factors were similarly significant. Keith Schoonmaker : And could you elaborate just to bit more on the mechanism of the how fixed variable effected the period? Clarence Gooden : Fixed variable effects in the period where we have whereas the customers take a larger shipments of coal that the larger the shipments that they take based on what their fixed price is that the average rate for that coal shipment comes down. Michael Ward : Then the fixed portion is shared over more tonnes lowers the rate. Operator : Thank you. Now our next question here comes from Justin Long of Stephens. Your line is now open. Justin Long : I wanted to ask your Eastern competitor said this week that it expects to get back to 2012, 2013 service levels by the back half of the year. For your network do you think that's an achievable target just given the significant or significantly more crews and more locomotives, is that something you have pretty clear line of sight to two at this point, and if not what are the risks to getting back to those service levels? Oscar Munoz : This is Oscar. I think again being consistent with what we've said we see certainly acceleration towards those levels in 2013 which were for CSX very much record levels. And again in full transparency I think we'll gradually improve to those levels and I think every bit of improvement will have a nice bottom line impact, but I am not quite ready to prepare to sort of give you a sense that we're going to be back to those record levels in this year certainly striving us for a bit longer term. Justin Long : Okay fair enough. And then just one quick follow-up, thinking about your second quarter guidance, could you talk about your volume assumption for coal in the quarter? Clarence Gooden : Well I think as Fredrik has articulated, we expect that coal to be down in the 5% range. It could be slightly worse than the 5% range but at least at 5%. Justin Long : I just didn't know if that was any different for the quarter versus the full year but you're just sticking to the same guidance. Fredrik Eliasson : That\u2019s for the full year, we haven't given a specific number for the second quarter but for the full year we think that's the right place to be. Operator : At this time we don't have any questions on the queue. David Baggs : Thank you and we'll talk to you again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call. You may now disconnect.",

And welcome to the CSX Corporation Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call all participants will be in a listen-only mode. For opening remarks and introduction, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. David Baggs : Thank you, Shirley, and good morning, everyone. And again, welcome to CSX Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2015 earnings presentation. The presentation material we'll be reviewing this morning along with our quarterly financial report, and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at csx.com under the Investor section. In addition, following the presentation a webcast and podcast replay will be available on that same website. This morning, our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Oscar Munoz, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Clarence Gooden, our Chief Marketing Officer will be available during the question-and-answer session. Now before I turn the presentation over to Michael, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company\u2019s disclosures in the accompanying presentation on slide two. The disclosure identifies forward-looking statements, as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. With approximately 30 analysts covering CSX today, and have to respect for everyone\u2019s timing including our investors, I would ask as a courtesy for you to please limit your inquiries to one question and if necessary a clarifying question on that same topic. And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael? Michael Ward : Well, thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that yesterday CSX announced second quarter financial results for its shareholders that included all-time company records for operating income and operating ratio, as well as earnings per share, which were $0.56, up from $0.53 reported in 2014. Overall, significant operating efficiency helped offset year-over-year declines in revenue and volume. Starting with the topline, revenue in the quarter declined 6% to $3.1 billion. Pricing gains were more than offset by lower fuel recovery, a changing business mix, and a 1% volume decline as we cycled last year\u2019s demand surge. At the same time, we have the resources in place to meet customer demand across the network, supporting improved service performance and operational efficiency. That efficiency coupled with lower fuel prices helped decrease expenses by 9% and delivered all-time records in operating income at $1 billion and an operating ratio of 66.8% for the quarter. We expect service momentum to continue as we progress toward the record service levels we saw in 2012 and 2013. That service is the foundation for driving long-term growth and value creation of our shareholders, as it also supports our ability to price to the value of rail transportation and produce ever more efficient operations. Now, I will turn the presentation over to Fredrik, who will take us through the top and bottomline results in more detail. Fredrik? Fredrik Eliasson : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing some more detail on our second quarter results. Revenue was down 6% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $183 million of lower fuel surcharge recoveries. At the same time, the impact of negative business mix and lower volume were essentially offset by core pricing gains. Volume decreased 1% from last year, with low commodity prices impacting coal and crude volumes and some of our merchandise markets, particular metals being challenged by the strong U.S. dollar. Core pricing continues to improve sequentially and for the quarter was up 3.5% overall and 3.9% excluding coal. Other revenue increased $46 million versus the prior year. The primary driver was the cycling of about $20 million negative impact to the in-transit reserve last year, coupled with the positive impact this quarter from a similar amount as network performance improved significantly. Expenses decreased 9% versus the prior year driven mainly by the impact of lower fuel prices. Our ongoing focus on efficiency drove $45 million in productivity gains in the quarter, but lower volume resulted in $32 million of cost reduction versus last year. In addition, we recorded a $17 million gain in the quarter associated with the sale of an operating rail corridor. Operating income exceeded $1 billion for the quarter for the first time in CSX's history and was up 2% versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense was similar to last year, while other income was favorable as we cycled environmental charges for non-operating activities from the prior year period. And finally, income taxes were $334 million in the quarter, reflecting higher pre-tax earnings. The effective tax rate was about 38%, which is consistent with our expectation going forward. Overall, net earnings were $553 million and EPS was $0.56 per share, up 5% and 6% respectively, versus the prior year period. Now, let me turn to the market outlook for the third quarter. Overall, we expect volume to decline slightly in the third quarter. Although, we expect a slight decline of the higher 2014 base, CSX\u2019s portfolio remains balanced with several growth markets offset by challenging near-term market dynamics in other. We are projecting favorable conditions for 49% of our volume in the third quarter and stable to unfavorable conditions for the remaining 51%. Strong intermodal performance will continue as our strategic network investments support highway to rail conversions and growth with existing customers. Increased infrastructure development projects continue to drive a favorable outlook for minerals. Agricultural is neutral as strength in domestic grain shipments closing out the prior harvest is offset by a weaker ethanol market as a result of higher inventory levels. Automotive volume is expected to be similar to the strong level we saw in the third quarter last year reflecting North American light vehicle production. Chemicals is expected to be neutral due to lower drilling activity stemming from the continued low commodity price environment, which will put additional pressure on volumes in our crude and frac sand businesses. Both markets are expected to decline by about 15% in the third quarter. However, strength in plastics and LPG will keep the chemicals portfolio stable. In unfavorable category, we sustained low natural gas prices under $3 and high stockpiles going into the heart of the summer season. Domestic coal volumes will decline close to 15% in the third quarter, and for the full year we expect volume to be down approximately 10%. Export coal volume is expected to be lower in the third quarter, reflecting global oversupply and the strong U.S. dollar. Although, we still expect about 30 million tons for the full year. Forest products will benefit from steady housing gains as inventories are worked off, but paper products remain challenged due to the secular trends in that market. The metals market is expected to be unfavorable as fuel production remains below prior year levels with the strong U.S. dollar encouraging higher imports. The phosphate markets will draw down on existing inventories and we expect volume behavior to be cautious going into the new harvest season. Overall, on a sequential basis, intermodal will experience a typical third quarter increase going into the peak season while the merchandise segment will remain essentially flat and coal will be down. Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectation for expenses in the third quarter. Beginning with labor and fringe, we expect third quarter average headcount to decline sequentially by approximately 1% as we align employees to the lower demand environment. We expect labor inflation to be around $25 million in the third quarter, which is a reduction from the level seen in the first half as union wage inflation becomes less of a headwind. In addition, we expect labor and fringe expense to benefit from further network fluidity improvement and efficiency as we remain focused on increasing train length and aligning crew starts. Looking at MS&O expense, we expect inflation to be offset by productivity gains. We also expect to incur remediation costs in the third quarter associated with the recent derailment in Maryville, Tennessee. Fuel expense in the third quarter will be driven mainly by lower cost per gallon, reflecting the current price environment and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the third quarter to increase $10 million to $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. Finally, equipment and other rents in the third quarter is expected to stay relatively flat to last year, with higher freight car rates offset by improving car cycle times. Now let me wrap it up on the next slide. CSX delivered another strong financial performance this quarter and as Michael mentioned, we set new all-time records for operating income, operating ratio and earnings per share. Looking ahead to the third quarter, while service excellence will continue to drive continued efficiency gains and strong pricing to support long-term investment in the business, we expect third quarter EPS to be relatively flat to the prior year. Included in this outlook, we expect to incur at least a penny impact related to the Maryville, Tennessee derailment. In addition, we will be cycling a strong demand environment to last year, which coupled with the dynamic conditions we are facing is expected to impact our volume growth. Domestic coal continues to be a significant headwind and we now expect that market to be down close to 15% in the third quarter. Looking at the full year 2015 earnings, we are still targeting mid to high single-digit EPS growth. However, given the current energy environment, achieving the upper end of that range will clearly be challenging. That said, we still expect to make meaningful improvement to our full year operating ratio and with improving service driving efficiency and strong core pricing that supports investment in the business, we are confident in the company's future and our progression towards the mid-60s full year operating ratio. With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks. Michael Ward : Well, thank you, Fredrik. As you\u2019ve seen today, CSX produced excellent results in the second quarter for its shareholders in a challenging market environment by driving operating efficiency with the committed efforts of our 32,000 dedicated employees. And we continued to focus on the actions that are foundational to our long-term success. Delivering excellent service supports growth and operational efficiency, which in turn creates customer value that enable strong pricing for the value of the service we provide and allows us to continue driving earnings growth and margin improvement. We are pursuing new opportunities across our diverse portfolio and further improving network performances to our consumers and producers throughout the global supply chain and to create value for you, our shareholders. Thank you for your interest in CSX and we are now glad to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Brian. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my call. So one thing that stood out is this is the first time in the quarter where you\u2019ve put all-in numbers in core merchandise, intermodal same-store sales pricing results anywhere really close to one another including last quarter. So, I was wondering how much did the shift in the business mix impact those numbers, and could you have had even higher pricing trends if the commodity carloads didn\u2019t drop off about 4% in the quarter. Is there any other -- any other color on that would be helpful? Thank you. Fredrik Eliasson : Brian, this is Fred Eliasson. The big driver here is that we\u2019re cycling the actions we took last year in the export coal markets. And as a result, we\u2019re seeing those two numbers harmonize more now and we expect that going forward as well. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. So you expect them to be harmonized in the near future at the same level on that 3.5% to 4%. Fredrik Eliasson : No. What I am saying is that the gap between the two numbers, between our all-in pricing and the non-coal pricing has been exacerbated because of the actions we\u2019ve taken over the last year or two in our export coal markets. We are now as we move into the third quarter moving past those actions from last year. I think, over time, we continue to expect strong pricing in all our markets as we continue to price to market and ensure reinvestment in the business. So, I think that gap will be much, much more narrow going forward. Brian Ossenbeck : Thank you, Brian. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Chris. Chris Wetherbee : Good morning, guys. Thanks. I wanted to talk about sort of the productivity gains that you\u2019re getting. You\u2019ve seen sort of the cost from efficiencies pickup 2Q to 3Q. Presumably, if service continues to improve, those numbers should get a bit better in the back half, but just wanted to get sort of an update on how you think about sort of the back half in terms of productivity and efficiency gains from the cost perspective? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, this is Fredrik again. We\u2019ve gone up to a good start here this year, obviously $45 million here in the second quarter, but $41 million in the first quarter. We have said that we still think we can approach $200 million for the full year, but probably not as close as we originally have thought because of what we saw in the first quarter, because of weather and also because of the fact that the volume environment is not as strong as we had originally anticipated. However, we\u2019re very much focused on driving efficiency gains, but just implied by the first half performance and our guidance for the full year, we are going to have a strong second half as well. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Tom. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning, Michael. I wanted to ask you a question on coal. I appreciate the commentary on third quarter and kind of how to look things. If you look beyond third quarter, how might we think about when coal volumes might bottom both on the utility and on the export side? I mean, do you think that kind of down 15% in fourth quarter and then maybe you are flat next year? Or how do we think about that, because it just seems like the pressures are in place both utility and export? And it\u2019s hard to -- looking at a couple quarters, it\u2019s just hard to know how to think about how coal volumes might play out? Thank you. Clarence Gooden : Well, Tom, this is Clarence. It\u2019s looking like the fourth quarter could be -- easily if gas prices remain where they are now to be repeated in the third quarter, it is probably too soon to tell about what export is going to look like next year, but it certainly won\u2019t be as strong as it is, has been this year as Australian benchmark stays where it is now. Australian dollar stays where it is now which is about $0.74, and the API 2 stays where it is now which is at the high 50s. Next year it won\u2019t be a good export year. Tom Wadewitz : So if you said the current conditions persist, do you think coal will down next year further or do you say well it\u2019s already been down enough this year so it\u2019s flat? Clarence Gooden : Well, there is certainly more upside than downside for next year, but it could be down. Michael Ward : So a lot depends I guess on the weather and where gas prices are. Clarence Gooden : Weather and where gas prices are, right. Weather and gas prices. Michael Ward : I think just to clarify what Clarence said, I think there is probably more downside to the coal volume next year than there is upside. Tom Wadewitz : Right. Michael Ward : If the current -- if gas prices stay, and the exports markets kind of remain challenging. Clarence Gooden : Yes. Based on seeing right now both between domestic and exports, probably more downside to our volumes for 2016 than there is upside in those two markets. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. I know it\u2019s a tough market to figure out, so I appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Allison. Q \u2013 Allison Landry : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering in terms of the fourth quarter, do you think that you could grow earnings year-over-year even if the volume environment remains soft, just given the acceleration in productivity gains, sort of getting the network back in balance and then continuing to see acceleration in the core pricing gains? Fredrik Eliasson : Well, I think Allison, this is Fredrik again. I think obviously we have two quarters behind us. We\u2019ve given guidance for the third quarter and we\u2019ve given guidance for the full year that range. So that range depends on what we\u2019re seeing -- what we\u2019re going to see in the fourth quarter. So, great momentum in terms of what we do on our productivity side. We continue to -- we see a strong pricing environment as well. But it really depends on how massive will this coal headwind be in the second half. And I think how those, kind of the positives and negatives work out, will allow us to see what we are ultimately going to be producing. We\u2019re certainly targeting to produce earnings growth. But I think until we get through a little bit more of this summer to see where the stockpiles end up as we go into the shoulder season, it\u2019s hard to exactly pinpoint where we\u2019re going to end up. Allison Landry : Okay. So it seems like coal is really the wildcard or question mark for 4Q. Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah. I think coal is the wildcard and I also think as we have indicated in the prepared remarks that we also expect a sequential decline in our crude volumes based on what we see in the spread due. And I think we\u2019ll going to have to follow that as well to see what the impact from that will be on our volumes there. Allison Landry : Okay. All right. Thank you for the time. Operator : Thanks. Our next question comes from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Rob. Rob Salmon : Hey. Good morning. As a follow-up to some of the productivity discussions, could you talk a little bit about -- if we look back a couple years, the productivity is a couple of miles an hour stronger. Maybe could you speak to operationally kind of what additional adjustments need to be made across the network to get back to those levels? And then Fred describes from a financial perspective what the bottom line tailwind would be if CSX achieves those two miles an hour of roughly of improved velocity. Oscar Munoz : Rob, this is Oscar Munoz, nice to meet you. Listen, with regards to the recovery aspect of that, I think what we\u2019ve said for sometime is the initial point of recovery was this quarter, second quarter and then the acceleration and continued performance and getting back to those record levels. I think the timing of that is related to a lot of the other activities that we've been talking about. But I think that\u2019s the progression we\u2019re making. Fredrik Eliasson : And yeah, we still have -- in the second quarter, obviously improved significant and sequentially throughout the quarter but we\u2019re still at the place where we still have over time levels that we think will come down. We have re-crew levels that could be improved, equipment cycle times can be improved as well, which is part of why we see us very robust opportunity set, not just in the second half of 2015 but also going into \u201816 as well. And that is going to be critical for us, as we see a topline environment that from a volume perspective, perhaps not as strong and as robust as we would like it, at least based on what we\u2019re seeing right now. So good momentum on our productivity side and should translate into some good numbers from a bottom line perspective as well. Rob Salmon : Note. And just as a clarification with the productivity, should we be expecting another elevated productivity gains looking out into 2016, given those expected, continued improvements? Fredrik Eliasson : I like to think that we should be able to exceed our historical average, which has been somewhere around the 130, 140 as we move into 2016. Rob Salmon : Perfect. Thank so much. Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah. Operator : Thanks. The next question comes from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Thomas. Thomas Kim : Good morning. Thanks for your time. Last quarter, you dispose as an operating asset. And I\u2019m curious if you could sort of frame out for us the opportunity set to monetize what management seem to be non-core or perhaps maybe less strategic going forward? Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah. This is Fredrik again. Yeah. So, we did have an operating property that we monetized here this quarter, was a deal that we worked on through an extended period of time frankly. And we do have some more, both operating and non-operating properties going forward and when they occur, we would be transparent with those. And of course, you will see them as I said when they\u2019ll occur. I don't think that the opportunity set is big enough where it\u2019s going to make a huge difference over time for us because we've done a lot of this over a last couple of decades frankly. But there is something that we constantly look at, to see if there are opportunities to rationalize some of the infrastructure we have, whether is operating or non-operating. Thomas Kim : Okay. If I can just ask a follow-on question related to that, to what extent do these -- for example, the most recent asset sale improve your operating expense? Fredrik Eliasson : One more time? Thomas Kim : With regard to -- for example the most recent asset sale, to what extent is the sale beneficial to reducing operating expense, is there some\u2026 Fredrik Eliasson : This sales specifically I don\u2019t think is going to improve our operating expense because it essentially a line segment that we weren\u2019t really operating much on it at all and so it really won\u2019t have an impact. There could be instances in the future really would but this one specifically didn\u2019t. Thomas Kim : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Bill. Bill Greene : Hi. Good morning, Michael. Clarence, I have a question for you on pricing, because I get asked this a fair amount and that is, when we look at sort of what CSX chose to do in export coal as things got weaker there, why would you not take a similar approach in the domestic market? Could you or is it your view that you can or cannot sort of preserve some volume, save some utility plants given the low natural gas price? How do you think about the pricing in the coal market, because that's something, given what you've done in export that folks look to and say, how sustainable is the pricing dynamic there? Clarence Gooden : Bill, we have taken a look at it and frankly, the gas prices are so low, we just cannot materially impact it enough to make a difference. Bill Greene : Okay. And then on the export side, is there -- we said we would lap this. It's done. Is there any risk further that the markets kind of cause you to sort of rethink that at all or at this point have you kind of done what you can do and the volumes will just take care of themselves from here? Clarence Gooden : We have done what we can do in the volumes, so we just have to take care in the sales. Bill Greene : Yeah. Fair enough. Thanks for your time. Appreciate it. Michael Ward : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Ken. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good morning, Michael and team. And just on the labor cost here, you have dug into cost per employee was flat this quarter versus up 5% last quarter. Just your thoughts, I guess, on a couple things around that and further employee cuts, I think, you noticed down 1%, but if volumes continued to fall, how do you think about that, Oscar, maybe in advance? And then, cost per employee, what happens to that as we go forward here on your productivity? Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah. And this is Fredrik, let me take that one. So, yeah, cost per employee did fall here versus what we saw in the first quarter and that\u2019s, obviously, part of that is, in fact that we now have close to 600 people on furlough and that reduced it. But also reduction in overtime, a little bit of reduction in training costs as well. So that helped. And as we move forward now, as we continue to run better, we probably have an opportunity, perhaps, that even greater number of furloughs and reduce overtime that reduce the crew, the recruits as well. I think there are opportunities to see efficiency gains that was obviously those have biggest expense component and therefore, the one that we focused relentlessly around, how do we reduce the number of people, how do we become more efficient, how do we become more efficient over the cost employee and so that, you should see continued improvement there. Thank you again. Ken Hoexter : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Brandon. Brandon Oglenski : Good morning, Michael. Good morning, team. Fredrik or Michael, think in the past, you have talked about how, you really need core to establish and I really want to hone in on the idea of that there is more downside risk 2016 closing that is probably is upside, where we have plenty shale gas in those countries, so I think we are resetting into this new reality that gas is just a lot cheaper than it used to be? But you are getting positive price, you are getting productivity, you are getting growth, especially in corridors like intermodal? So, in the longer term is it possible to get sustainable earnings growth and margin expansion to hit that a lot of target even if we are facing continued sequential core declines or is that still going to be too much headwind on the business? And maybe we don't understand how difficult it is to get the cost out of the core system, maybe that\u2019s where we have been underestimated? Michael Ward : Well, obviously, coal is a very profitable business of ours in our portfolio. But I do think that the fact that we will be able to produce the 66.8% operating ratio here in the second quarter with coal being down more than $100 million year-over-year is a great testament to what our core strategy of service excellence to our customers is providing. Now, clearly, as we look forward, the impact of the coal declines is going to also impact the path of progression. We are going to make meaningful improvement here in 2015 and we feel very confident that overtime we can get to that mid 60s operating ratio. And I think this quarter as I said earlier is a great testament to that, but if coal is cooperating, we can get there faster and if coal is going to not cooperate is going to take us longer, which is why at this point I don't think we have enough clear around the coal picture to really put a flag down in the ground on when we actually get to that mid 60s operating ratio. Thank you. Brandon Oglenski : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Jason. Jason Seidl : Thank you. Good morning, guys. How is everything? Michael Ward : Great. Jason Seidl : Quick question here, obviously, you mentioned a little bit on furloughs and you have some very good productivity numbers in the quarter? Is the network right sized for the current volumes or is there a little bit more work to do as you move throughout the third quarter? Oscar Munoz : Jason, it\u2019s Oscar. We are always, always, reflecting on where our volume loaded and the capacity is. So it\u2019s never perfectly right sized but we are working towards that. We have a lot of capacity. Importantly, I think, our train size initiatives have been really creating even more capacity and more productivity. So, we'll continue to work on that, teams done a great job of it. But I think there is still opportunity to right size. Jason Seidl : Okay. Appreciate it, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matt Troy with Nomura. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Matt. Matt Troy : Hey. Good morning. My question was on intermodal. Specifically, just if you could give us a sense in terms of the competitive environment you referenced in your press release some competitive share loss and I was wondering if you could just put that into context and then more specifically just looking at the rate trends whether you are looking at revenue per carload, a revenue per ton-mile, certainly we\u2019ve seen a step down in those metrics over the last two quarters. Obviously, fuel is a big component of that traffic category. I just want to make it clear as to what\u2019s going on with rates, if you could just answer those two. That\u2019s all I got. Thank you. Michael Ward : On the competitive loss as you are aware, we don\u2019t make particular comments for individual customers. On the revenue-ton mile as you summarized, it is all in fuel. On the rates of sales in the trucking market, we still find that these truckers are keeping their rate structures up this year into 3% to 5% range on the trucking renewal rates. Our particular spot markets in our trucking part of our door-to-door product has been very strong this year. Our transcon product has been down a little bit because we are still rebuilding our owner operator base in the L.A. Basin from the strike. But the core part of the intermodal business and the pricing this year has remained fairly strong as we've been able to price for the value of the service that we are offering into competitive markets for our reinvestments we've been very pleased with that. Clarence, you want to comment on the domestic volumes? Clarence Gooden : Yes. As you\u2019ve seen the domestic intermodal volume themselves have been up around 9% in our intermodal business, so the highway to rail conversion programs that we\u2019ve had in place have been quite successful this year. Matt Troy : Absolutely. That\u2019s what I was pointing out. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Ben. Ben Hartford : Good morning. Clarence, maybe just to continue that point, there has been a lot of debate about the pace of conversions going forward as the truck load capacity situation has normalized a bit in \u201815 from \u201914, fuel prices are lower, rail services has not fully been restored. What is your -- let\u2019s take a timeframe, three year view on the pace of domestic intermodal conversions and the opportunity? What are shippers saying given some of the diverging trends with lower diesel fuel prices, with some of these looming capacity constraints? Has the outlook changed at all meaningfully over the past several quarters? Clarence Gooden : Ben, I don\u2019t think it has. We -- in 2014, this crew that we lost some intermodal business back to the highway due to the service issues. But we are actually seeing some of that volume return in 2015 as services improve. As I mentioned in the highway to rail conversions, our estimates this year will be in excess of 40,000 new loads on CSX organically in addition to what our trucking partners are growing back to rail that will grow. As you know, the electronic reporting that we require next year and the legislation will kick in and we think that that's going to put more stress on the particularly small truck load carriers that will make intermodal more attractive. That has changed in the highway issues that are around, congestion that\u2019s in the highway in America. We still have the driver issues and shortages that are facing the trucking companies as we go forward. If you look at what's happening in Congress today, we still will have a highway transportation bill probably be passed with the continuing resolutions and no new confusion of the money to rebuild the highways and the infrastructure in this country, so all the issues that we\u2019ve talked about over the past few years still remain. So, intermodal to me looks, is a very positive thing going forward for the next two or three years. Ben Hartford : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Hi Cherilyn. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. You saw good sequential improvement in both on-time originations and arrivals. But there was much more improvement in originations than arrivals, which I think is the normal order things as network velocity increases. Maybe you can just talk about that. And when we should expect to see the gap between those two metrics narrow? Oscar Munoz : Hey, Cherilyn. Thanks. It\u2019s Oscar. Historically, as you probably know, there has always been a small gap between the arrivals and the originations, and we have seen both measures improve as we want to restore a service level. We would expect the improvement in arrivals to slight lag that of originations, again as that continuity of service improves. The key thing for us is to focus on how late the average train is. That is a metric we\u2019ve seen substantial improvement over the last several months, so in effect spend. So while you will still see the optic on arrivals a little lagging, we actually look at it still more internally the number of hours that our late is improving. So I think over the next quarter and two and then certainly into next year, I think you will see that gap narrow to its historical average. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thank you. That\u2019s my one. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, David. David Vernon : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Fredrik, may be just a bigger picture here. The volume growth is moderating. The GPMs are down a little bit. Do you see any opportunity deploy in the CapEx budget? And then longer-term, do you think we should be -- how should we be thinking about the impact of the reduced utilization of the coal network on depreciation going forward? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes. In terms of capital I think we have the $2.5 billion number out there. We are looking at that to see if it makes sense. But in general, a lot of those products have already been started. So I am not sure if there is many opportunities short term. We have a sales kind of corrective mechanism and then we tied it to revenue and I think that will be correcting it. Ultimately, that\u2019s a proxy for gross ton miles because 80% of that we spend is a reflection of how much we run over the next network. So if that comes down, then our capital will come down. So we will look at that as we get into the planning for 2016. And then in terms of the coal network, I can assure you we had a very concerted effort in 2012 to see what we could do to drive our cost there. We\u2019re excellent at taking out train starts and crew base to more than reflect the kind we saw in volume. And here now in 2015 and 2016, there is a renewed focus again because of the step function change that we\u2019ve seen to further look not just train starts and look at the crew base and the locomotive assets we have deployed, but also the fixed infrastructure that is up there and to see what we can do. It is not as black and white as you would like because we do have growth up there as well and we run other traffic around there. We have seen a lot of growth in LPG and fraction in those same areas, but there should be more than we can do and our team is very much focused on those efforts. David Vernon : Appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Larkin with Stifel. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, John. John Larkin : Good morning, gentlemen. Clarence was very adamant on the first quarter call about how pricing was accelerating from the later stages of the first quarter into the second quarter. Is that going to continue into the third and fourth quarter? Or are we going to plateau at this relative high level where merchandising intermodal same store pricing is up say 3.9% year-over-year? Michael Ward : Well, John, as you can see in the past several quarters, we\u2019ve improved the pricing sequentially. And here in the second quarter you can see that we had 3.5 all-in and 3.9% in the merchandising and in intermodal. As I look forward we remain focused on the strong pricing reflecting the value of the service we provide across all these competitive market which just defies the reinvestment in our business that drives a long-term value of our shareholders. So that\u2019s what you will see. John Larkin : Got it. Any pushback from customers given that service levels have been fully recovered, are they willing to absorb those even higher price increases given where service currently stands? Michael Ward : I think they see that the service that we\u2019re providing right now has just defined that price levels for the reinvestment that they see that we\u2019re doing. John Larkin : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial Group. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Hi, Bascome. Bascome Majors : Hey, good morning. So coal miner\u2019s financial situation has continued to deteriorate here. And we\u2019ve seen recent reports that one of your smaller customers is going to file for bankruptcy this week and other larger miners that were still working on restructurings here. Can you just talk a little bit about how you manage your risk in this business given financial situation on that side, maybe a little bit on the business side such as pricing pressure which you addressed a little bit already but counterparty risk as well? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes. This is Fredrik. So obviously from a credit perspective, we do monitor it very closely. Many times it\u2019s actually utilities that pay the bill. But we do have some exposure to some of these producers that are going through a very difficult time. So we\u2019ve already seen some of those go through restructuring. Generally, we are well protected through a variety of means through that process. And one of the most important thing is that if you do want to restructure out of it, you\u2019re going need to need the rail service that we provide in order to be successful in transforming the company. And overall, from a broader perspective, clearly we're also looking at the capital deployment. And you heard in other previous question, we're really trying to make sure that as we look at reinvestment in coal-related assets that we\u2019re really taking a long and hard look at whatever capital put in there to make sure that we\u2019re not leaving capital stranded for 40 years, which is essentially the life of assets that we\u2019re putting in. So we work very, very hard across our system to make sure that we\u2019re making prudent decisions around that. So, great question. Thank you. Bascome Majors : Yes. Do you have a sense for how much is paid to the -- or just percentage of your business where you\u2019re paying the miners versus utilities were just balance with export versus utility mix or is it more complex in that? Fredrik Eliasson : Well, I think on the domestic side, I think the majority is clearly paid by the utilities and on the export side, I think there is little bit of a more mix and more perhaps the producer. Bascome Majors : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. With the revenue, well, I shouldn't say revenue, but the volume outlook taking another step down, have you rethought the capital program at all and can you talk a little bit about where the capital is going to help in terms of the productivity recovery and get the system back to fluidity? Fredrik Eliasson : Sure. So in terms of the capital, $2.5 billion is our capital plan here for 2015. We are looking to see if there\u2019s some things that we would move out of this year. But as you -- so far into the year, it's hard to affect the current year because a lot of these things are well underway at this point. What we are looking at next year and we do have that kind of self-adjusting mechanism that it\u2019s tied to percentage of revenue when we talk about it publicly, but internally we look at it from a gross ton mile perspective more perhaps. 80% of what we spend is on the maintenance side and 20% is productivity. And clearly this year our main focus has been to acquire additional locomotives. We\u2019re acquiring about 200 locomotives new and rebuilding about a 150 and that has been the number one priority for us already starting last time this year -- last year this time, where that has been the focus of ours to make sure because that has been the linchpin in order for us to get back to the sort of service excellence levels that we've been looking for. Other productivity initiatives, we have plenty of them that not just is capital driven but is specific driven capital as locomotive. Fuel optimizer, for example to make sure we drive fuel efficiency. We have a variety of other technology products that we\u2019re working on and also automation on some of the other back-office functions. So there is a wide variety of things that we put capital towards to drive productivity. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Scott. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So I wanted to follow up Oscar, your comment about more to go in terms of right-sizing the network. Just given the volumes and now the service levels improving, is it possible ahead to start seeing some more material headcount reduction? I don\u2019t know, 3%, 5%, 10%, I don\u2019t know, is that possible? Oscar Munoz : Scott, I think I\u2019d answer by the fact that we always make those adjustments commensurate with where we see the volume forecast. And so it's hard to detect specifically a number, but we\u2019ll as you've seen us do before take the appropriate measures. Fredrik Eliasson : And to add to Oscar\u2019s answer that we do expect and I said that in prepared remarks about a 1% decline sequentially in headcount and we already have 600 people in furlough and it is our largest expense base. So we\u2019re going to be very, very prudent and very, very thoughtful about what we\u2019re doing there, because we do need to reduce our labor expense in order to create a sort of productivity savings that we\u2019ve outlined. Scott Group : Yes. So just with that maybe Fredrick, so the volume environment changed most notably in the second quarter. How much of the cost response from you guys did we see in the second quarter versus how much are we going to see ahead? If there is a way to kind of bucket it out? Fredrik Eliasson : I guess, this is a pretty hard question to answer. I do say that from the overall productivity knowing our guidance for the full year and the fact that we\u2019ve been done here about $86 million for the first half. Clearly, we have at least as much in the second half or somewhere around there and so there is a lot of opportunity still. We have done a lot of structural things that we have worked on for a period of times in terms of train length and of course some of the other ongoing initiatives as well. And well we have made some inroads in terms of driving the fluid into the network back. It was only kind of partly through the second quarter we really got traction around that. So as we move into the second half, we should expect more of that. And so we\u2019re once again, we feel very strong and we feel very bullish about the opportunity set going forward on the productivity side. Thank you, Scott. Scott Group : Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Donald. Donald Broughton : Good morning, gentlemen. Help me better understand your guidance of expecting meaningful full year OR improvement, because to the first half, the gross cost of diesel is down about $325 million. So you had a run rate, let\u2019s call $650 million. If I just assume that the cost of diesel is down by $650 million for the full year, and the fuel surcharge is down by $650 million and all of your other operating costs remain constant on a year-over-year basis. That alone would create 150 basis points of OR improvement. So is meaningful full year OR improvement less than or greater than 150 basis points? Fredrik Eliasson : Well, that -- it have to be seen. It\u2019s a good question. We have taken out in the first half, if you just look at our quarterly flash we\u2019ve gone from about 72.3 last year in the first to 69.5. So that\u2019s obviously very meaningful improvement in just one-year timeframe. As we think about this quarter specifically, the majority of our gain was actually not fuel related because fuel this quarter while it came down, we actually had a negative impact year-over-year because of the negative lag and the spread differential that we saw. So I'm not going to pinpoint exactly where we\u2019re going to end up, but we do clearly expect meaningful improvement despite the fact that the volume environment is less than stellar. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Hey, Cleo. Cleo Zagrean : Good morning. I would like a little bit of help with fending the utility coal volume down side for the next year. Where do you see that coming from? We\u2019re potentially hoping for some reversal of gas switching and inventories having normalized? So is that retirement driven? What are you hearing from your customers that drive your cautiousness on domestic utility? Thank you. Fredrik Eliasson : Well, the stockpiles are -- both in the north and south are higher than normal. So there is some inventory hang. We still expect that the gas prices will be relatively low as it would be the second point. And the third is there is some research that would indicate the installation of more gas acres in the region that we serve and are currently in service. So the combination of those three would lead us to believe that there could be a possibility that the utilities consumption of coal in our area would be slightly less than it is this year. Cleo Zagrean : Okay. And then just as a quick clarifying follow-up, when you give guidance for domestic coal, do you include the domestic math or that refers to utility? Fredrik Eliasson : Includes both, everything. Cleo Zagrean : Thank you very much. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Patterson with Topeka Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Rick. Rick Patterson : Good morning, guys. Hi. Oscar, you put out a service update in May that listed your T&E trainees at 1,235. What's that number today? Oscar Munoz : The people -- by the way Rick nice to hear you, welcome back. Rick Patterson : Thank you. Oscar Munoz : The number in training we have, approximately it\u2019s about 800 right now. Oscar Munoz : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hey good morning. Hey, I was just curious, if we could get a lot more detail on the acceleration of the non-coal pricing. And I appreciate this might be a bit of semantics but Clarence, was the sequential acceleration fairly broad based or was it more in thousand say intermodal than the other merchandise, just maybe some broad comments there? Clarence Gooden : No, it was very broad based across almost all of our commodity lines. Tyler Brown : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, John. John Barnes : Hey, thank you. Hey, good morning. Hey going back to the CapEx question -- I hate to beat this to death but how quickly can you really prioritize the project list and reallocate the capital? And then if volumes continue to be weaker, how aggressive are you willing to be on say maintenance CapEx? Is there any give and take there? Fredrik Eliasson : I think from a maintenance spread, the developer things that you can do that short term would save you money but long term would hurt you. So just for example, shutting off our teams that are out there replacing the rail right now is something that you could do. But long term doesn\u2019t make sense because mobilizing and demobilizing something is more expensive than taking advantage of the fact that you have the teams out there right now. So there are things you can do but the key thing is that you do things that are smart. And so that\u2019s why I think that making significant changes in you capital budget is not necessarily the right thing to do from a long-term economic perspective. But as we think about next year, we will always -- we always look at what the gross ton miles would be. We look at the line segments and so forth that we need to allocate capital to. And that\u2019s where I think the coal example is a good place. We really are looking long and hard to make sure that what we\u2019re putting in that makes sense, of course, without sacrificing safety in any way, shape or form. And so we constantly look at that and we will take a look at what next year capital budget would be in the context of what the gross ton mile picture will look like. John Barnes : Thank you. Michael Ward : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning Justin. Justin Long : Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on me final tank car regulations that we got during the second quarter. Assuming everything in this regulation which stands legal pushback, how should we think about the impact these changes could have on your business going forward? Michael Ward : Justin, I think we are by and large very pleased with the new tank car standards they come out with, we think it\u2019s a much safer vehicle. We were a little bit surprised that the thermal blanket was not included and we will continue to push for that as an industry because we think it gives some extra layer or safety at not a great expense. As far as the long-term impact on the business, obviously as you know, we don\u2019t own the tank cars, the customers or leasing companies do. Our early read is that most plants retrofit their cars or buy new cars that meet those standards. Obviously, it impacts the economics of the movement somewhat and as Clarence alluded to earlier, there is already a little bit of pressure on the crude movement just because of the current spreads between Bakken and Brent. But we think longer term that this car is a better car or safer car and I think we\u2019ll continue to see the movements of the crude as we go forward. Justin Long : Okay. Great. Thanks for the time. Michael Ward : Thank you. Thank you everybody. We will see next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen only mode. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. You may begin, sir. David Baggs : Thank you, Shirley and good morning, everyone and again welcome to CSX Corporation's third quarter 2015 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we'll be reviewing this morning along with our expanded quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements are available on our website at CSX.com under the investor section. In addition, following the presentation a webcast and podcast replay will be available on that same website. This morning our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Frank Lonegro, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Cindy Sanborn, our Chief Operating Officer and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Sales and Marketing Office along with Clarence Gooden, our President will be available during the question-and-answer session. Now, before I turn the presentation over to Michael, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company's disclosure and accompanying presentation on slide 2. The disclosure identifies forward-looking statements, as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, with the research analysts. With nearly 30 analysts covering CSX today, and out of respect for everyone's time, including our investors, I would ask as a courtesy for you to please limit your inquiries to one question and if necessary, a clarifying question on that topic. And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael? Michael Ward : Thank you, David, good morning, everyone. Yesterday, CSX announced third quarter financial results that demonstrate our ability to effectively manage in a dynamic marketplace. Our results included net earnings of $507 million, which translates to earnings per share of $0.52, a third quarter record. Looking at the top line, revenue in the quarter declined 9% as pricing gains were more than offset by lower fuel recovery, the continued transition in CSX's business mix, and a 3% volume decline as we cycled 2014's high demand environment. At the same time, we continue to be an industry leader in safety and we are leveraging our improving network performance to deliver strong service and efficiency savings to help reduce operating expenses. As a result, CSX delivered operating income of $933 million and a third quarter record operating ratio of 68.3%. As we look across our business, low natural gas prices are clearly challenging domestic coal volume. More broadly, low commodity prices and the strength of the US dollar continue to challenge many of our other markets. In this environment, our goal remains providing safe, reliable service that consistently meets our customer's expectation. That service is the foundation of our ability to create long-term value for customers and shareholders as it supports pricing for the value of our service and produces increasingly efficient operations. Now, I will turn the presentation over to Frank, who will take us through the financials and the outlook in more detail. Frank? Frank Lonegro : Thank you, Michael and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing some more detail on our third quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 9% versus the prior year. This was driven mainly by $175 million decline in fuel surcharge recoveries and a $75 million impact from lower volume. At the same time, core pricing gains were essentially offset by negative business mix. Volume decreased 3% from last year with low natural gas prices impacting domestic coal volume and low commodity prices coupled with the strong US dollar, challenging export coal and some of our merchandise markets, particularly metals. Core pricing continues to improve sequentially and for the quarter was up 4.6% overall and 4.4% excluding coal. Other revenue decreased $32 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower liquidated damages, and an adjustment to reserves related to volume-based customer refunds. Expenses decreased 11% versus the prior year, driven mainly by a $145 million favorable impact from lower fuel prices. Our ongoing focus on efficiency drove $42 million in productivity gains in the quarter, while lower volume resulted in over $70 million of cost reduction versus last year. As a result, operating income was $933 million, down 4% versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense was similar to last year. Other income was favorable as we cycled environmental charges nor non-operating activities, as well as costs associated with the early retirement of debt from the prior year period. And finally, income taxes were $292 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. Overall, net earnings were $507 million, essentially flat to last year, and EPS was $0.52 per share, up 2% versus the prior year. Now, let me turn to the market outlook for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we expect volumes to decline in the fourth quarter. Although we are projecting stable to favorable conditions for several key markets, this will be more than offset by unfavorable conditions for the remainder of the portfolio. Intermodal continues to be a strong growth engine as our strategic network investments support highway to rail conversions and growth with existing customers, and automotive is expected to grow along with light vehicle production trends. Agriculture is neutral as strength during the fall harvest season and our improved efficiency will be offset by weakness in export grain and the continued risk of ethanol imports driven by a strong US dollar in a challenging global market. Chemicals is expected to be down materially as energy markets reset to an environment marked by low crude oil prices and reduced drilling activity. We expect that crude oil volumes may be down at least 25% in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis. Metals is unfavorable as the strong US dollar and high levels of imports continue to negatively impact domestic steel production levels. As such, we expect the year-over-year rate of decline to be similar to what we experienced in the third quarter. Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by sustained low natural gas prices and we now expect domestic coal volume to decline around 20% in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to next year, significant coal headwinds are expected to continue in 2016. Sequentially, our quarterly run rate for domestic coal volume in 2016 should hold relatively flat to the level we expect to see in the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, export coal is expected to be lower, as global oversupply and the strong US dollar continue to pressure volumes. Despite the year-over-year decline, we continue to expect about 30 million tons of export coal for the full year. Looking ahead we expect this market to be even more challenged in 2016. Overall, we expect fourth quarter volume declines as we cycle a strong 2014 volume environment, continue to feel the effects of low natural gas and crude oil prices, and the impact of strong currency on our export and import sensitive markets. Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the fourth quarter. Overall, we expect fourth quarter expenses to benefit from the continued low fuel price environment as well as productivity and volume related cost savings as we remain focused on increasing train length and aligning resources to the lower demand environment. To illustrate our progress, in the third quarter we increased overall train length by about 10% versus the prior year, which drove a significant reduction in crew starts. Looking at labor and fringe, we expect the fourth quarter average head count to be down approximately 2% on a sequential basis, which reflects about a 6% reduction from the prior year. We expect labor inflation to be around $25 million in the fourth quarter, slightly below what we saw in the third quarter. Looking at MS&O expense, we expect inflation to be offset by efficiency gains and volume-related savings. Fuel expense in the fourth quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon, reflecting the current price environment, volume-related savings, and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the fourth quarter to increase about $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. Finally, equipment and other rents in the fourth quarter is expected to stay relatively flat to last year with higher freight car rates offset by improving car cycle times. Now, let me wrap up on the next slide. CSX delivered another solid financial performance in the third quarter with earnings per share up slightly from the prior year. Top line growth was lower than we initially expected, but our continued focus on pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains, and aligning resources to a weaker demand environment helped to offset those volume headwinds. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we will again be cycling a strong demand environment last year, which coupled with the challenging market conditions we are facing this year, is expected to impact our volume growth. In addition, we expect headwinds in our coal and crude oil markets to increase in the fourth quarter driven by sustained low commodity prices. As I mentioned earlier, domestic coal volume is expected to be down around 20% versus the prior year. And crude oil volume is expected to decline at least 25% sequentially. As a result, we expect fourth quarter EPS to be down slightly versus the prior year. Included in this outlook are two possible items that could be finalized in the fourth quarter. First, EPS could benefit $0.05 from a conveyance of non-operating property that could close near the end of the quarter. This will be booked below the line in other income. Second, and above the line, EPS could also be impacted by a few cents relating to short-term costs in the fourth quarter associated with a new union labor agreement and some structural changes in our coal network. Both of these costs will drive future benefits, as we gain greater workforce flexibility and adjust to lower demand in our coal market. Looking at full year 2015 earnings, we are still targeting mid-single digit EPS growth and meaningful improvement in our full year operating ratio. In addition, as we further align resources to the soft demand environment, coupled with our expectation for 2016 coal volume, we are looking at opportunities to drive structural changes in our coal network, in order to accelerate efficiency gains next year. Our commitment to service excellence continues to drive efficiency gains, strong pricing, and long-term profitable growth, all of which supports investment in the business. With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks. Michael Ward : Well, thank you, Frank. As you heard today, CSX is taking action to manage the challenges of this dynamic marketplace. With currency and commodity prices to continue to impacting coal and several other merchandise markets in 2016, we will continue to match resources to the business environment. At the same time, we remain committed to delivering strong service that supports operating efficiency and creates customer value necessary to support strong pricing, which enhances our ability to invest for the future. Through these strategic investments and productivity initiatives, we are positioning the CSX network to leverage longer term opportunities for profitable growth in our merchandise and intermodal markets. As such, this management team absolutely believes that CSX can and will achieve a mid-60s operating ratio longer term. We will now be glad to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. You may ask your question. Eric Morgan : This is Eric Morgan with Brandon's team. Thanks for taking my question. I want to focus on intermodal, obviously, a really strong growth domestically, called out some share shift on the international side. Can you talk about just the outlook for each of those segments and if that sort of the growth domestically is really sustainable throughout next year? Fredrik Eliasson : Well, thank you, Eric, this is Frederick. On the domestic side, we are seeing the benefit of the investment and improving service product that we are seeing. We have been able to grow that business somewhere between 5% and 10% over last several years. We are seeing a little bit of an enhanced growth here this quarter, as we know one of our customers who has the contractual ability to further diversify the portfolio is doing just that here in the quarter. So we are seeing a little bit of an uptick in the growth with that customer right now beyond what we would normally see, but we feel good about that business, feel good about the ability to continue to grow that at a multiple economic output for a period of time here going forward. On the international side, we are experiencing growth with several of our existing customers. We have lost several contracts over the last 12 to 18 months, but overall we feel very good about our network reach and the service that we are providing, and so we feel good about that business going forward and we want to make sure that we continue to reinvest in that business, a critical goal of ours as we move forward. Eric Morgan : I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Brian. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the coal outlook. Maybe you can just run through some of the assumptions you are embedding in the domestic coal kind of holding where it is right now and may be retirements, natural gas, and any coal to gas switching, and then if you can touch briefly on export coal, a lot of the thermal pricing we're seeing now suggests that there's not a whole lot that's going to be economic going into Europe at least, especially when you adjust for FX. So I'd like to hear a little bit more behind your assumptions there. Thank you. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure. This is Fredrik again. In terms of the domestic coal, Frank gave you a view there in terms of that sequentially, after we are going to be down, at 20% year-over-year is our estimate in the fourth quarter. Sequentially from there, that run rate of about 21 million tons or so for domestic as a whole is a good place to think about next year. And really there are two drivers behind that, one is that our -- at this point, we are being dispatched last because of where natural gas prices are, so that is not going to shift as we move into next year unless natural gas prices come up. Obviously, it would be a very different and more appealing picture, but there are two drivers behind it. One is the fact that we have probably about 3 million tons that we are moving this year that we will not see next year because of planned closures; and then the second driver is, as we look at the inventory levels at utilities that we serve, they are still at elevated levels. So we are going to have some headwinds next year and that's kind of the foundation. And that 21 million tons that I alluded to, which is the sequential quarterly run rate, is probably about 15 million tons on the utilities side and about 6 million tons on account of that net coke and iron ore. On the export side, I think what we've said is that we did about 18 million tons in the first half of this year. We are in a run rate with implied guidance that we've given of 30 million tons -- of 12 million tons in the second half. And as I think about the second half run rate, I think that's a good run rate if you analyze that, so 24 million tons for next year. We will have a much better sense as we get to the fourth quarter because we are obviously in a market right now to try to see what we can do, especially on the steam side, and it is a much more difficult environment even today than it was just six months ago, so we are working through that but we will have a better sense of export market as we get to the fourth quarter earnings release. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Thank you. A quick follow-up on just some of the initiatives on the coal network. It sounded like you're taking some steps to do some realignment on the actual infrastructure, if you could just run through what you're doing and what type of benefits you are seeing and when you would expect to see those. Thanks a lot. Cindy Sanborn : Okay, Brian, this is Cindy. Frank mentioned that we are analyzing and looking at what we need to harvest from our existing coal network, where we have seen the most significant declines in Appalachia. We haven't announced anything yet, but we have plans to do so and stay tuned on that one. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Chris. Christian Wetherbee : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Cindy, if you could just bear with me, I wouldn't mind just following up a little bit on that. If there is any way you can give us a sense of what might be on the table, if it's sort of shuttering lines completely or at least sort of dialing the volume dynamic down quite a bit. I mean, is everything on the table? I'm just kind of curious if there is any incremental detail you can add to that. Thank you. Cindy Sanborn : Chris, I think everything is on the table. And as far as whether it would be facilities or lines, I think you will understand and appreciate that we want to be able to talk about those things internally before we do externally, but there's really not anything that's not on the table. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. That's helpful. And then when you think about sort of the head count of the business as you look out into 2016 and start your planning there, assuming we maintain sort of a fairly slow growth economic environment, how should we think about the appropriate staffing levels at CSX? And maybe what the opportunity is, potentially, in terms of leveraging that dynamic of growth and volume -- maybe not so much growth on the head count side. Any help you can give us there would be really great. David Baggs : Well, I think what we've demonstrated here in the third quarter, we have to run a tight, efficient, and reliable network. And we are, as you mentioned, in a very dynamic environment. From the standpoint of operations head count, we do have 1200 T&E employees furloughed. We have ramped down our training significantly. And we will be continuing to do that going forward to match demand. Clearly, we have furloughs that we can pull back into active service if needed. Although, there are a handful of locations where we have very few furloughed and we will need to -- we may need to hire in those locations. We will be offering opportunities for existing employees and what we would consider deep furlough, those opportunities to go back there -- back to those locations. But generally speaking, we are managing that on both the hiring side and recognizing that we have furloughs to pull from as needed. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. All right, that's helpful. Thank you so much for the time. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Tom. Thomas Wadewitz : Hi. Yeah, good morning, Michael. Good morning, everyone. So, I wanted to ask you a question to start with on the pricing side. You guys have done a great job at ramping up the pricing and really capturing the opportunity with the further ramp up in same store price. I think when we saw the tightness in 2014, we thought, \"Well, maybe there's at least two years of good price.\" But, obviously, 2015 volumes have been pretty tough. How do you think that translates into pricing in 2016? Would you say, \"Well, given the weakness in volumes, we are likely to see a deceleration versus the same store price?\" Is that realistic or do you think there's some way that you can just really leverage your position in the market and sustain what's been very good pricing this year? Michael Ward : Well, I think the key thing is continued service excellence for value proposition with our customers. And that's what Cindy's team is doing a great job here as the resources have arrived to really provide the in-service excellence for our customers. So, we are pleased with the results here in the third quarter in terms of the same store sales. And, as you well know, you will be able to see that each and every quarter, as we move forward, in terms of what we are able to accomplish. But, strong pricing is a critical component of what we're trying to do from an overall value equation. It's one of the key levers we are pulling. And, as we tip to improve our service product, we feel good about what we are going to do going forward as well. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay. So, it sounds like you don't really want to comment at this point on 2016 pricing, whether it gets better or worse. What about the sensitivity to the truckload market? I think there's been good truckload contract pricing this year, but the spot market has been weak. Is that something you would expect to impact your pricing fairly broadly? Or is that -- would you say, \"Well, that's kind of narrow in terms of impact maybe on 2016 pricing?\" Fredrik Eliasson : Well, I do think and just going back to your first point, you know, we do look at pricing as being critical in terms of what we are doing and we said this for a long time, strong pricing is paramount to our long-term success financially. That's a key driver for us going forward as well. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay. So it sounds like you don't really want to comment at this point on 2016 pricing whether it gets better or worse. What about the sensitivity to the truckload market? I think there's been, you know, good truckload contract pricing this year but the spot market has been weak. Is that something you would expect to impact your pricing fairly broadly or is that -- would you say, well, that's kind of narrow in terms of impact maybe on 2016 pricing? Fredrik Eliasson : Well, I do think that, and just going back to your first point, we do look at pricing as being a critical component to what we are doing. And we've said this for a long time, that strong pricing is absolutely paramount to our long-term success financially. So, that is a key driver for us going forward, as well. In terms of the truck market, it's clearly sequential over the last, probably, four to six months, it has gone softer. But you also have to remember that, if you look at where truck prices are today, versus the beginning of last year, they are still up significantly. And we have only been able to touch portions of our contract base. So, I think you know that in our merchandise business, only about half of our business is up on the annual basis. And most of our other businesses, they are mostly 3 to 5 year contracts. We do feel that we will have good opportunities to reflect what the value we have in the marketplace, and with improving service on top of that, we do feel good about our pricing opportunities going forward as well. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay. Great. Thank you for the time. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Alison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Alison. Alison Landry : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Within context of your comments on coal for 2016, and specifically on the domestic side, could you help us think about coal yields within the -- given the variable coal price structure, obviously we saw some impact this quarter, but thinking about 2016, any color there would be helpful. Thanks. Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah, so in terms of the coal yields overall, not just on domestic, but on the export, if you look at the book of business as a whole, there are three, really, drivers there. One hand we are clearly getting core pricing in that business and we expect to continue. Clearly, the export side is very difficult right now, but on the domestic side, we are getting some good core pricing. On the fixed variable, was clearly also a big driver here in the third quarter, as the volume came down significantly, about 20% of the utility contracts have that sort of structure, in terms of their contractual nature. And then also lapping, fully lapping the significant pricing declines that we took in our export market in the second half of last year, having fully lapped that was also very helpful as well. So we have three drivers. As we move forward, I think you are going to continue to see the export market being very challenged. And there's little opportunity, if any, to really improve pricing there. But, on the rest of the market, we are going to continue to see what the -- what the value proposition is. And we are going to look, plant by plant, to see what we can do. Alison Landry : Okay. And then, just on the 20% of utility contracts that have the fixed variable structure, do you have a sense of what that percentage would be in 2016? Fredrik Eliasson : I don't, right now, see that that's changing materially. But as we go through the normal sort of negotiations, that might change. But, right now, I don't see that changing materially. Alison Landry : Great. Thank you so much for the time. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes with Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Rob. Robert Salmon : Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. As a quick follow-up to Allison's question with regard to the fixed variable component. With the domestic coal expected to be down even more strongly next quarter, should we expect coal yields to improve sequentially, even with the lower fuel price? Or is kind of Q3 a pretty good run rate for us? Fredrik Eliasson : I think, to Tom's dismay, a few questions earlier; we tried to stay away from specifically forecasting our pricing. Mix will always play an impact in it. But, ultimately, the same store sales, I think, is the best way to look at our pricing. So, we are going to continue to do what we can to make sure we capture the value that we provide in the marketplace and then let the chips fall where they fall in terms of what the ultimate number will be. Robert Salmon : Fair enough. And, Frank, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned, kind of, that you guys were doing some work on a labor agreement and there being, potential savings. Can you remind me whether it was a cost or a benefit we should be expecting in the fourth quarter? And any sort of preliminary thoughts that we can use as we think out to next year for what that means for the bottom line for CSX? Frank Lonegro : Right. So, publicly, we've announced that we have a tentative agreement with some of our mechanical unions which would imply, if ratified, a slight cost in this quarter, and then benefits as we go forward into next year and beyond, based on labor efficiencies there. But we are not going to quantify that right now, until everything gets ratified by the unions. Robert Salmon : Understood. And the cost in the fourth quarter? What did you call out in the prepared remarks? Frank Lonegro : Yeah, we said a few pennies and we bundled a couple of things together, there that are above the line. The union agreement that I just mentioned. And then some of the coal structural things that Cindy had talked about previously. Robert Salmon : Got it. Appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Tom. Thomas Kim : Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask, on the service side, obviously, we are still seeing some good incremental improvement. But, we did notice that, sequentially, whether in speed or in dwell, the rate of change, or the rate of improvement slowed a little bit. And, I'm just wondering, can you give us a sense on how -- so you are thinking about the trajectory of when your service levels get back close to that 2013 level. And, if you could, frame what sort of cost savings opportunity that presents for us. I think that would be very helpful, thanks. David Baggs : I think, Tom, we are where we thought we would be on our service measures, as we look at this, about this time last year. We feel like our customers are seeing and feeling that benefit. And we are also seeing, from a performance perspective, reduction in overtime crews and those type of costs. And it's worth noting that we have accomplished these significant improvements in -- during the same timeframe we have been working very hard on our operating plan to institute our variable train schedules, which has also given us some consistent and valuable productivity, particularly on the T&E side, yet is still giving our customers a very clear and obvious trip plan that they can depend on. So, I think, as we go forward, we will continue to see some improvement. I don't think it will get quickly back to 2013 levels at all, as we are -- as we are challenged at some locations on the southern part of our network with side incapacity with our longer trains. But we will see incremental improvement and we think we are doing a pretty good job of balancing the service measurements along with the productivity and efficiency side by taking this approach. Thomas Kim : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Alex [indiscernible]. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Alex. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just touch on the efficiencies in the quarter. Michael Ward : It looks like you got about a $41 or $42 million, if I added it up correctly, in the quarter, roughly in line with kind of the first half. Is that kind of 40 millionish per quarter productivity savings something that you would expect to kind of continue, or should we expect it to maybe accelerate into 2016 as service continues to improve? I know there's a lot of moving pieces, but how do we sort of think about that productivity savings and maybe within the context of your the long-term historical productivity achievements? Frank Lonegro : Thanks, Alex, it's Frank. You are right. We saw a little bit over $40 million in productivity in the quarter and also delivered over $70 million in volume-related cost reductions. Sometimes that gets left out of the conversation, but for the fourth quarter, I think you should you expect a similar productivity level from us that you saw in the third quarter and, again, volume costs ought to come down in line with the volume declines as well. For the full year, as you probably remember, we started the year with approaching $200 million as our productivity target, and throughout the year we helped you understand that that would be more and more challenging as volumes came down and our mix began to change, and we're now targeting the full year 2015 productivity to be approximately $160 million. And, again, that's in addition to the volume right-sizing that we're doing as we take resources as volumes decline. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to clarify a comment on the 4Q guidance. Does the 4Q guidance for EPS to be down slightly year-over-year, is that inclusive of the two items you highlighted as possibly occurring and finalized in the quarter? Frank Lonegro : Correct. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Ken. Ken Hoexter : Hey, good morning, Michael and team. I just wanted to follow up on the coal outlook for next year. You mentioned kind of run rate in the second half. Does that mean we should not see accelerated plant closings or continued conversions in nat gas when you look at that, particularly on the domestic side? I just want to understand Fred's second half outlook. And then just a follow-up on that last question on the charge in the fourth quarter that you've included, does that look at the gain offsetting the cost or can you quantify as one larger than the other? Thanks Fredrik Eliasson : This is Fredrik. Let me just clarify the coal guidance. There are two pieces to it. One is the domestic guidance where we said that we expect the fourth quarter to be down about 20%, and from that absolute level, which implies in 20% decline, about 21 million tons total for domestic, that that's a good run rate going forward by quarter for 2016. The second half guidance is really related to the export coal market where we said we did about 18 million tons in the first half of this year and implied in the guidance of 30 is that you are doing 12 in the second half. And I think that 12 million-ton, if you analyze that, it gets you to you 24 million tons in 2016. That's a good starting point at this point. They are still in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter. We have a lot of work to do here to see what ultimately gets placed, but our best estimate, just to give you as much transparency as we can on the export side, is that's probably a good starting point for 2016. On the EPS, Ken, yes, the property sale below the line a nickel and then we have said a few pennies in the combination of the union agreement in the coal structure and I'll let you draw your conclusions from there. Ken Hoexter : Great. I appreciate the follow-up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Rick Paterson with Topeka capital Markets. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Rick. Rick Paterson : Good morning, guys. A question for Cindy. Welcome. Could you update us on locomotive capacity and if there's anything more you need to do there? For example, are there any plans to increase rebuilds beyond 150 or increase next year's new order beyond the 100 currently on the books? Thanks. Cindy Sanborn : I think where we are with locomotives, our active locomotives have decreased in terms of number sequentially from quarter one to quarter two to quarter three and to accomplish that, we are returning leases and we are also paying back horsepower hours. So those are the outputs, what we're moving out of the active count. We are, as you mentioned, getting new locomotives. We have 65 yet to receive in the fourth quarter and another 65 rebuilds, of which a portion of those are 4X, locomotives for our local fleet. Overall, we intend to manage demand by storing locomotives as the next option to take out any excess that we would have. And you mentioned the purchases in 2016 also that, yes, we are receiving 100 in 2016. But we will manage our locomotive fleet based on demand and obviously balancing that with service. Rick Paterson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Jason. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Good morning, gentlemen. Let me start with intermodal first. Can you talk a little bit about the demand side? Because we are starting to hear about pricing expectations in truckload slipping, and given that, diesel prices are near six-year lows. Are you starting to see any weakening on the demand front in terms of conversions out east or is it still staying strong? Fredrik Eliasson : Well, in terms of the fuel reference that you made there, I think overall it's important to remember that our fuel surcharge on our intermodal business is different than the rest of the business. It really mirrors the trucker. So it really does not come into play that much in terms of what fuel does in regards to how much we can and can't convert. We are still seeing good vibrancy. There is no doubt, though, that at least on a spot basis right now that the truck rates have come down. But on the contractual side continues to have, as far as we can see, a pretty good rate increase on the contractual side, because I think people are cognizant of what will happen longer term, both in terms of driver retention and some of the negative productivity initiatives that the trucking industry is facing. So obviously, we'd like to see it get sequentially stronger from where it is today, but knowing where the contract rates are, and the fact that if you go back a year and a half, rates have come up quite significantly since then on the trucking side. We still feel that it's a good opportunity, both to convert traffic and to continue to have good pricing vibrancy. Jason Seidl : Okay. Thank you. That was great information, Fred. And if I look out to 2016, you gave us some really good starting points on how to look at coal, I doubt anybody had coal up in their internal models, but we'll have to see how that pans out. How do you look at the rest of the business, given that coal is going to be a drag again? Are you guys going to be able to grow your overall volumes in 2016, based on what you see now in your book of business? Fredrik Eliasson : I think that's a little bit too early to tell, but clearly with this sort of a significant decline in our coal business, it is going to be difficult to do that. What we are going through right now is our normal planning process and look at the rest of the business to see what we're facing. There are some opportunities for continued growth in several markets. In several markets, though, we are facing both significant volume from last year that gets the year-over-year comps difficult for the rest of this year and perhaps even a little bit into the first quarter. And we are continuing to see the negativism impact on the dollar and the lower commodity prices as well. So as we think about the book as a whole, there is a lot of dynamics that goes into planning for next year, but we continue to feel good about some of the secular things that we are seeing out there like domestic intermodal, for example. So we will have a much better view of that as we get into the fourth quarter and especially as we get to the fourth quarter earnings release. Jason Seidl : I appreciate the comments and the time, sir. Fredrik Eliasson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Troy with Nomura. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Matt. Matthew Troy : Good morning, everybody and thank you for the time. I just wanted to ask a question on the broader economy. Obviously we're getting mixed signals, but directionally there seems to be a sense that some of the industrial weakness, some of energy commodity weakness has crept in the consumer end markets, beginning in the spring and maybe spread a bit further into fall, early winter. I want to just get your sense, if we strip out energy, how does that consumer economy look? You've got good comments about intermodal, but you guys have been at this for a long time. How does the economy feel to you and where do you think we are in the cycle? Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah, I think that if you look at some of the core tenants of our economy, such as the housing and the automotive side, you continue to see good vibrancy, obviously growth from a low base in housing and auto being at the peak demand, but continued expectations for growth there. The core chemical business is also doing okay. And then with the lower fuel prices, I think the consumers are feeling a little bit stronger. But then you do have the energy side that you talked about and the fact that if you look at kind of the broad industrial production index, you see industrial production sequentially coming down. And I think the latest number I saw for the fourth quarter was actually that industrial production will actually decline year-over-year. So I think you have a lot of different variables that goes through right now. Clearly, we are very much dependent on the industrial economies. That's a big driver of ours. But at the same time, we do our -- we are getting more and more exposure to the consumer side of things as we continue to grow our intermodal business. That's helping to offset that. So, without saying anything more than the fact that it's a dynamic environment and we are recognizing the industrial side of things are struggling sequentially, we still feel good about our long-term prospects in terms of being able to grow our business. Matthew Troy : Thanks, Fredrik. And, I guess, one follow up would be -- As you mentioned specifically in your comments in the press release, that you had lost several contracts in international intermodal over the last 12, 18 months. Were there any additional ones in the last quarter? Or are you merely highlighting the ones you've previously highlighted, and the lag impact they had through the quarter. I'm just trying to get a sense if the competitive environment has changed at all. Or is this just a residual impact of contracts we already knew about? Thanks. Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah, this was the residual contracts we already know about. I think we pointed out, in our second quarter earnings release as well. And, so nothing has really changed from that perspective. We continue to be focused on our network and continue to be focused on the service product that we are producing. And making sure that whatever we carry on our network allows us to continue to reinvest in the business. Matthew Troy : Okay. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Ben. Ben Hartford : Good morning. Good morning, guys and Cindy. Cindy, specifically, can I get your perspective on service and your expectations? Obviously, we are dealing with a weaker volume environment, we have been this year. Next year's outlook is being tapered lower. But, in terms of the pace of service improvement, could you provide any context to what expectations should be next year? And whether there's line of sight to getting back to some of the prior peak levels of 2012, 2013's experience at any point in time during 2016? Cindy Sanborn : So, as I mentioned before, I think we will continue to see steady improvement in service performance. As far as 2013, I mean, that's certainly aspirational for us. I really can't give you that, at this point. It's a balance of -- of both service, which obviously our customers expect of us. We want that to be very reliable, but we also have to manage the efficiency component of that as well. So, that's kind of the place that we are in and figuring out what -- when we will get back to 2013. Ben Hartford : As a follow-up, has anything changed -- has the experience, I should say, over the past 18 months, has it changed your confidence in your ability to get back to those high watermarks, as it relates to service? Cindy Sanborn : I don't think it's changed. I think it's just simply balancing -- making the balancing act in an environment where we are seeing the reduction in volumes that you heard us talk about. Ben Hartford : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD securities. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Cherilyn. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much. And good morning. Just on the economy, again, there has been some talk that what we are seeing, at least in part, is an inventory correction that's related to the West Coast port disruption. Because, in effect, shippers over ordered when they weren't sure how quickly inventory could move through the supply chain. I'm just curious if that's a dynamic that you are seeing in the marketplace? Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah, I do think that that's a good point. We are seeing that the inventory levels are coming up. I think we referred to it in our paper market, for example. And as you look at some of the official statistics out there, you have seen an increase in customer inventory. So, that certainly is playing a factor here in terms of the more muted volume outlook. Cherilyn Radbourne : And then just a very quick one on labor expense. It looks like labor inflation in the quarter was a little higher than you had been expecting. Was there anything of a one-time nature in there? Frank Lonegro : Hey, it's Frank. Yeah, there sure was. In the quarter, we had inflation of $33 million, which is slightly higher than you are normally seeing. The base wage inflation was normal. We did have a fringe adjustment related to employee furloughs. So, you should expect a more normalized $25 million run rate in the fourth quarter. Cherilyn Radbourne : Perfect. Thank you. That's all for me. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, David. David Scott Vernon : Good morning. Thanks, guys. Maybe just bigger picture, Michael. As you think about looking for low double digit decline in coal next year, after a mid-teens decline this year. As you think about the earnings power of the business, how should we be thinking about that? Obviously, longer term people have been thinking rails as low double digit growers. This year has been a transitional year of more mid-single. Is next year also going to be setting up as more of a transitional year? Do you think there's a chance that you can get back up to that double digit EPS growth rate? Michael Ward : Well, clearly, we have the challenges of coal we've discussed pretty extensively here. I think some of it depends on where the economy heads. Because, as you know, over the last two to three years, we have been growing those other businesses faster than the rate of the economic growth. If the economy improves, we think we can do that again next year. If it stays at a moribund rate, obviously, it's much more challenging. David Scott Vernon : So, in your theory, is there more you guys can do on the productivity side to kind of help offset some of that? Obviously, the core pricing is good; the share gains in intermodal are great. I'm just wondering, obviously, you did a little bit of back office work in Jacksonville earlier this year. Should we be expecting you guys to dig a little bit deeper on that front, as well? Or how should we be thinking about the productivity side for 2016? Michael Ward : I think you're going to see us extremely focused on the productivity side. You saw evidence of that here in the third quarter, that same intensity we will bring to 2016. And we'll take actions to make ourselves more and more productive going forward. David Scott Vernon : All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John Larkin with Stifel. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, John. John Larkin : Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. I'm fascinated by the strategy to run longer trains by running essentially six trains within a seven day window, where you normally would have run seven trains. How far along is the implementation of that strategy? And then, as a follow on to that question, how long will it take to add enough passing sidings or extend existing passing sidings so that those longer trains don't impinge upon network fluidity and service quality? Cindy Sanborn : Good morning, John. I think what you will see is we are pretty far along in the adjustments that we are making for longer trains in our merchandise network. We are also, as an aside, increasing the length of trains in our bulk network too. So we are taking -- we are pushing both levers. What is great about the variable train schedule is, as demand requires, we can flex up and flex down. So, I think it will be a continuing effort on our part to match demand in what is traditionally been a fairly fixed -- what we considered fixed network on our carload side. So, I don't know that the answer -- I think the answer is we are probably not ever done, but a principle and preponderance of the work has been done, based on the demand that we are seeing right now. And I couldn't remember your second question. Michael Ward : Passing siding. Cindy Sanborn : Passing siding. So, I think we are evaluating really where we are in the corridors that we need to adjust the length of passing sidings. We are really in the middle of that now. So, there's some corridors that are more impactful to us than others. Obviously the northern tier is mostly double track. What we are going to be working on is in the southern part of our network that is preponderance of single track. John Larkin : Maybe just a follow on, on the general topic of capacity. Since intermodal is growing quite nicely, particularly on the domestic side, where do you stand with respect to excess capacity in the intermodal network? Can you absorb another 5%, 10% 15%? Where do we start to run into congestion problems and limited capacity issues, as intermodal continues to grow, even in a tepid economic environment? Cindy Sanborn : I think from a train perspective, I think we have taken advantage of our northwest Ohio expansion and actually have reduced some train-- or increased some train length on our intermodal network as a result of that. But we do have capacity on the trains for the foreseeable volume that we think we will see. And I will remind you, we have done a lot of work on double stack clearances and so forth as well. So, we feel pretty good about where we are there. John Larkin : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Bascome. Bascome Majors : Good morning. I wanted to dig in a little more onto the longer term changes you are considering making to your coal network here. And I know you don't want to talk tactically about what's going to happen next year and the impact. And I understand that. But, you did say that everything is on the table. And I'm just curious, the end game three or four years down the road, could you frame, maybe, some metrics that would apply to your coal network today, whether it be related to capital, investment, CapEx to revenue and some of the dedicated parts, or any way that we can think about it and what your goals are for two or three years down the road to change that network and improve, be it profitability or capital efficiency on that part of your network where the revenues are down considerably? Cindy Sanborn : Well, I think when we look at our -- the coal network, it's a kind of spaghetti branch-line kind of operation with some main lines in between. As we are seeing some of the loaders -- load outs either closing and consolidating, it is our -- we have an effort afoot here to try to figure out where the best efficiencies are. Some of it will be mainline operation; some of it will be facilities. Clearly, the capital investments have been over time not, maybe, transparent externally, but have been, over time, coming down. That will continue to take place. And as we really lose open a particular branch or a particular line volume there; we can also look at repositioning some of the assets into other parts of our network where we are growing. And back to the siding capacity question that I got a few minutes ago. There's kind of a multifaceted way that we are looking at it, but as you can imagine, it's a very complex challenge because we want to certainly serve the customers that are loading. It is very profitable business for us, and as you probably would recognize, not everybody is on one branch is closing. We have multiple examples of places where we have got some closing, some not, that we have to look at how we are going to serve. So that project is underway, and I probably can't give you more color than that. Michael Ward : I guess we would add we do expect the Illinois basin coal to continue to grow. As you know, we made an investment last year in what we call our Casky yard, to allow us to move unit trains from the Illinois basin down into the southeast in a much more efficient manner. So it's not just looking at some assets tar less intense but also making sure we are positioned for the future growth. Bascome Majors : Understood. I appreciate the color. Tying it all together, is there an environment where CapEx could be hitting sort of its cycle high watermark in this year and last at the kind of 2.5 range? Or is it too early to see if that could fall off materially as we look into next year and 2017? Michael Ward : This is Michael again. I think it's probably a little early to look at that. Obviously, we are still going to be making investments in the base safety and efficiency of our network, but in addition, as we see our opportunities in the intermodal market growing, there will probably continue to be strategic investments there. So I think it's a little early to give you an overall number on that. Bascome Majors : Understood. Thanks for the time this morning. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you. Hey, good morning, Mike. How are you? Michael Ward : I'm doing good. Jeff Kauffman : Congratulations. Tough environment out there. These are terrific results. Michael Ward : Thank you. [indiscernible] say that on this call. Thank you for doing so, Jeff. Jeff Kauffman : Oh, a pleasure. Thank you. A question for Cindy, because a lot of my other questions have been asked. We take a step back and look at how these changes in the environment are changing the network. So, for instance, you are still down about a mile and a half, almost two miles an hour on train speed, but maybe the traffic mix doesn't allow you to get back there. We are still at 204,000 cars online versus 182,000 two years ago before we got the big volume surge. Can you talk about where you are in terms of getting productivity to where you want it to be? And, as you mentioned with the longer trains, maybe that's a drag on train speed and looking back to two years ago, maybe that's not the right metric to think about where you will eventually be. But when we look at train speed and when we look at accidents and when we look at assets online, where do you think we eventually go, say, over the next one to two years as you are looking to get the network where you want it to be? Cindy Sanborn : So, as far as productivity, we obviously want to be a reliable network and serve our customers, but we are we are probably never satisfied on the productivity side. When you look at velocity and, to your point, take it a step back, we are seeing a concentration of volume on one portion of our network and we are seeing a tremendous reduction in volume on other parts of our network. So you've got a compression there on top of building longer trains that we talked about, which in a single track railroad can be a little bit challenging, at least at the onset, until we make maybe a few investments there. I wouldn't say we have a target with cars online. With volume running well, you don't want that number to ever get to zero. You want to be able to serve your customers and you want to be able to do it efficiently and effectively. I think our viewpoints on going forward, it's probably on the productivity side, the cycle time of equipment, and to a lesser extent maybe the velocity side, although that is an important component in terms of turning assets, but the asset component is really where we'll be spending the most of our time. Jeff Kauffman : Okay. And, Cindy, this quarter we saw a big jump in on time originations, but on time arrivals still continued to lag. Can you talk about what's causing that friction and when you expect that gap to narrow? Cindy Sanborn : Yes, and we've talked about that on previous calls that we are seeing the span on our arrivals decrease. And that has continued into the third quarter. So while the absolute number is exactly what with you see, we are seeing the amount of lateness, if you will, go down. And this is occurring as we are doing some tremendous -- I talked about tremendous and significant changes to our operating plan. So we expect that to get to more normalized levels going forward. Jeff Kauffman : Okay. Everybody thank you and congratulations. Michael Ward : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Scott. Scott Group : Hey, thanks, good morning, guys. Frank, can you just clarify one quick thing? The comment on fourth quarter earnings is the base from last year that you are using $0.49 or is it the $0.52 excluding some of the one-time labor stuff? Michael Ward : It's on the reported basis, Scott. Scott Group : Okay. So I see kind of the fourth quarter is going to have really good productivity with labor down 6% or so. Very good pricing, but a big coal headwind and earnings down. It kind of feels like that's the environment for 2016 of good pricing, good productivity, but coal down a lot. What is your confidence that you can grow earnings in a full year 2016 environment? Michael Ward : Well, I think your summation of the fourth quarter is correct. It's probably too early for us to talk about the specifics on 2016. We have certainly gives you a lot of visibility into domestic and export coal and as we always do, we'll be focused on the things that are most within our control, right sizing the resources, driving efficiency, running a better railroad and value pricing and growing what we can grow with the markets. Scott Group : Okay. And Michael, maybe just one for you. So we had some unexpected management changes. Maybe give us your perspective on the changes, the new team and kind of what it means for you and your plan and long term at CSX. Michael Ward : Well, I think evidenced today by the answers you have been getting from this new team we have in place, we have a super team here to drive us forward. I think we've got the talent we need. Our direction as a company is not changing. It's all about controlling the things we can control, growing where we can, and I'm very excited about it. I will be around. I have committed to at least another three years to the board to make sure that we have a good transition here as we work our way through this transition, but I feel very good about it, and I feel great about the team we have. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Cleo. Cleo Zagrean : Good morning and thank you. My questions relate to your targets for a long-term operating ratio improvement. Can you please refresh us on your latest view on how the building blocks for that may have changed, based on your experience this year and your latest strategic update? Where should operating improvement come from most -- price, volume productivity or any other way you would like to describe it to us? And as a follow-up, related to that, how should we think of the mix impact on margins, given that intermodal versus coal continues to evolve? Thank you very much. Michael Ward : Thank you. In terms of the long term guidance, again, you saw in our prepared remarks and in the press release, we are still confident in our ability to deliver a mid-60s operating ratio long term. I think the drivers are going to be the same drivers that you've heard us talk about over the long term, and those are the efficiency, the service and the value pricing and adjusting our resources to volumes as they tick up and tick down, but we're confident in that ability. In terms the mix, certainly mix will be an impact for us in the fourth quarter and moving forward but that doesn't change our confidence in our future that we will reach a mid-60s operating ratio longer term. Cleo Zagrean : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Justin. Justin Long : Thanks. Good morning. So as we think about the pace of pricing over the next several quarters, do you think intermodal price increases will be roughly in line with car load price increases or is there a reason to believe that price increases in one of these businesses will outpace the other? Fredrik Eliasson : This is Frederik again. I do think we're going to stay away from specific guidance. We are pretty transparent already in terms of the same store sales that we provide you in terms of a look back in the previous quarter. Intermodal is always the most difficult one to get sustained inflation plus pricing, but nevertheless, based on the fact that we haven't been able to touch as many contracts as we would like since the beginning of last year, we do feel good about where we are heading on pricing going forward. Justin Long : Okay. Great. And maybe a quick last one. I wanted to ask about share buybacks. With the pullback in the stock, I'm just curious if you've considered a more aggressive approach to buybacks going forward. Fredrik Eliasson : You know, we have considered that. At the same time, we are railroaders and not stock pickers so we've also done some post-audit work on prior programs and really looked at whether or not a rateable approach or a timing approach was better and we are sticking with a rateable approach. So you can anticipate a similar run rate to what you saw in the third quarter. Justin Long : Okay. That's helpful I appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Hello, John. John Barnes : Hey, thank you. Hi, Mike. How are you? Hey, Mike, I know you said you are a little reluctant, maybe, to delve too deeply into the CapEx budget. But, your long-term guidance has been in that high-teens percent of revenue. It looks like you are tracking a bit over that this year. Is that the right metric to look at going forward? Or do we need to focus on the absolute dollar amount of capital required in the business? And just how do you think about that guidance going forward? Michael Ward : Well, John, it's interesting that you mentioned. It may be a better way to look at it, just as the absolute dollars. Obviously, the fuel surcharge revenue is going down. And, as you know, it's not a profit element for us, but it clearly impacts those top line revenues and maybe that percentage. So, I think thinking of it in terms of absolute dollars may be the way we evolve over time. John Barnes : All right. All right. Very well. And then, Frederick, you talked about the contracts and the intermodal-- I guess, the international side that you lost earlier in the year. Is there anything else from a competitive standpoint, contract-wise that's coming up for bid, that's out there that we should be keeping an eye on, nervous about? Has there been some change in the competitive environment that puts any other business maybe more at risk than it has been in the past? Fredrik Eliasson : No, I think we continue to be focused on the intermodal side specifically, on making sure that we continue to reinvest in the business. We have a great service product. We have a strong network. We have some very innovative things in terms of what we have done with our hub and spoke system that gives us a network that I think is unparalleled in the east. And as we move forward, we always will have a contract that comes up and we will have some wins and losses over time. The key thing for us, as I said, we've got to make sure that we continue to reinvest in our business. And that's how we judge in terms of how we look at and how we approach contracts. John Barnes : Very good. Hey, nice quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. Michael Ward : Thank you everyone for joining us and we'll see you again next quarter. Operator : This does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation in today's call. You may disconnect your lines.",

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. David Baggs : Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. And again, welcome to CSX Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we\u2019ll be reviewing this morning along with our quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at CSX.com under the Investors section. In addition, following the presentation, a webcast replay will be available on that same website. This morning, our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Frank Lonegro, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Cindy Sanborn, our Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer along with Clarence Gooden, our President, will be available during the question-and-answer session. Now, before I turn the presentation over to Michael, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the Company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the Company\u2019s disclosure on the accompanying presentation on slide two. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements, as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. With nearly 30 analysts covering CSX and out of respect for everyone\u2019s time, including our investors, I would ask as a courtesy for you to please limit your inquiries to one question and if necessary, a clarifying question on that same topic. And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael? Michael Ward : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, CSX reported fourth quarter net earnings of $466 million or $0.48 per share, down 2% from the same period in 2014. Revenue declined 13% in the quarter. A strong pricing was more than offset by the impact of lower fuel recovery, a 6% volume decline and the continued transition in the Company\u2019s business mix. Expenses also decreased 13%, primarily the result of lower fuel prices, lower volume related cost and efficiency gains. As a result, operating income decreased 12% to $791 million while the operating ratio improved 20 basis points to 71.6%. In addition, CSX remains an industry leader in safety and service measures continue to progress well as we enter 2016. In fact, Chicago operations have now been fluid for nearly 12 straight months. Now, turning to the next slide, I\u2019ll discuss full year performance. Over the past five years, CSX has transformed its business to continue delivering solid results despite the global energy transition. As you can see on the left side of the chart, during that period, CSX coal revenue alone declined from $3.7 billion to $2.3 billion a cumulative reduction of $1.4 billion. CSX has overcome that loss by significantly diversifying its market mix, improving service and investing in long-term growth opportunities. As a result, in 2015, coal represented only 19% of CSX\u2019s revenue, down from more than 30% in 2011. During that same period, shareholder returns including dividends and repurchases have continued to reward the owners of our Company, reflecting the steady growth in earnings per share which reached $2 in 2015. Our 2015 performance was achieved despite the challenges in the energy market, low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar that impacted many of our markets. Revenue of $11.8 billion reflected growth in intermodal, automotive and minerals that partially offset the continued declines in coal. Improving service, aligning resources and costs against the lower demand environment and driving efficiency gains of more than $180 million helped generate operating income of nearly $3.6 billion and our first sub-70 full-year operating ratio at 69.7%. Those results reflect the employees\u2019 relentless focus on safety and delivering service that supports strong pricing and ever increasing operational efficiency as well as the benefit of lower fuel prices. We will continue to leverage our core strategy, superior network reach and diverse market mix to create long-term value for our shareholders. Now I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Frank who will take us through the quarterly results and future outlook in more detail, Frank? Frank Lonegro : Thank you, Michael, and good morning everyone. Let me begin by providing some more detail on our fourth quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 13% or $411 million versus the prior year. This was driven mainly by $198 million decline in fuel surcharge recoveries and about $175 million from the impact of lower volume. At the same time, core pricing gains were more than offset by the impact of negative business mix. Volume decreased 6% from last year with coal driving the majority of the decline. Low natural gas prices coupled with the impact of significant flooding in South Carolina impacted domestic coal volumes while low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar challenged export coal in many of our merchandise markets. We continue to see strong core pricing, which for the fourth quarter was up 4.1% overall and 4.5% excluding coal. Other revenue increased $19 million from last year, driven primarily by unfavorable adjustments to revenue reserves in the prior year period. Expenses decreased 13% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $117 million in lower fuel prices, $107 million in lower volume related costs and $59 million in efficiency gains. In order to further drive efficiency, we closed two facilities in our coal network and completed a new union labor agreement in the fourth quarter. As a result of these actions, we incurred a $48 million or $0.03 EPS impact in the quarter. These short-term restructuring costs will drive future benefits as we gain greater workforce flexibility and continue to adjust to lower demand in our coal market. Operating income was $791 million in the fourth quarter, down 12% versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates. As we highlighted on our last earnings call, a property sale closed in the fourth quarter for a gain of $80 million or a $0.05 benefit to earnings per share. This gain was associated with a non-operating property and was booked below the line in other income. And finally, income taxes were $275 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. Overall, net earnings were $466 million, down 5% versus the prior year and EPS was $0.48 per share, down 2% versus last year. Now, let me turn to the market outlook for the first quarter. Looking forward, we expect volumes to decline in the first quarter. We expect the challenging freight environment to continue as the headwinds associated with coal, low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar more than offset the markets that will show growth. Automotive is expected to grow consistent with light vehicle production and especially in comparison to a year ago when the auto network experienced weather and service related congestion. Minerals will benefit from continued highway and non-residential construction activity and new business. Intermodal is neutral as continued secular domestic growth and our strategic network investments that support highway to rail conversion are essentially offset by customer losses in international. Agricultural products is unfavorable due to low corn prices coupled with weakness in export grain and import sourcing in ethanol driven by a strong U.S. dollar. While core chemicals is expected to again be flat, the overall chemicals market is expected to be down as energy markets continue to reset to an environment marked by low crude oil prices and challenging spreads. Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by low natural gas prices and an inventory overhang due to mild weather. For 2016, we expect domestic coal volume to be around 19 million tons per quarter. Export coal will continue to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply. Our full year outlook for export coal volume is around 20 million tons with some downside sensitivity. Metals is unfavorable as the strong U.S. dollar and high levels of imports continue to negatively impact steel production levels. Overall, despite a slow growing economy, the freight environment continues to have pronounced challenges with low commodity prices, low natural gas and a strong U.S. dollar. Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses. Overall, we expect first quarter expense to benefit from the low fuel price environment as well as continued productivity and volume related cost savings. Looking at labor and fringe, we expect the first quarter average headcount to be down approximately 2% on a sequential basis, driven primarily by the structural changes in our coal network that we announced in the fourth quarter. This reflects about a 10% reduction from the prior year. We expect labor inflation to be around $25 million per quarter throughout 2016, in line with the level seen here in the fourth quarter. Looking at MS&O expense, we expect inflation to be offset by efficiency gains and volume-related savings, in line with the trends we have seen in the second half of 2015. In addition, the first quarter will reflect a shift in our northern Ohio coal operations. Here, we took action early in the fourth quarter to consolidate freight from a facility in Ashtabula to CSX\u2019s Toledo Docks, which further streamlines our coal operations. Fuel expense in the first quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon, reflecting the current price environment, volume related savings, and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the first quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. Finally, equipment and other rents in the first quarter is expected to stay relatively flat for last year with higher freight car rates offset by improved car cycle times. Now, let me talk about our capital investment plan for this year. In 2016, CSX\u2019s total capital investment will decline over $100 million from the 2015 level to $2.4 billion, which includes $300 million for PTC. Similar to 2015, we expect 2016 core capital investment to be higher than our long-term guidance of 16% to 17% of revenue due to our locomotive purchase commitment. This investment in new locomotives expands our ability to run longer trains and we\u2019ll continue to storing older locomotives to maximize the efficiency of the fleet. Looking at our capital allocation for 2016, you can see that over half the investment will be used to maintain infrastructure to help ensure a safe and fluid network. The majority of our 2016 equipment investment is focused on upgrading our locomotive fleet. We took delivery of 200 new locomotives in 2015 and expect to receive another 100 new locomotives in 2016 which will complete our existing locomotive purchase commitment. In addition, we will continue to focus on strategic investments that support long-term profitable growth and productivity initiatives. Here we are prioritizing these investments in our intermodal business, infrastructure projects that support network fluidity, and technology initiatives to enable productivity. Finally, looking at our investment in Positive Train Control, we have invested $1.5 billion through the end of 2015 and we plan to invest an additional $300 million in 2016. CSX is committed to meeting a new legislative timeline for PTC. As we look at the path to achieving this goal and with PTC now extending over a longer period of time, we now believe the total cost of PTC implementation will be about $2.2 billion. Now, let me wrap up on the next slide. Overall, CSX delivered solid financial performance in 2015 despite significant market challenges. Full year EPS increased 4% from the prior year, while our operating ratio improved 180 basis points to 69.7%. Revenue in 2015 was lower than we initially expected with volume declining 2% for the full year. But our continued focus on pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment helped to offset those volume headwinds. Looking ahead, we expect the coal headwinds to continue in 2016. As I mentioned earlier, domestic coal volume in 2016 is expected to be around 19 million tons per quarter, while full year export coal volume is expected to be around 20 million tons, again with some downside to the export estimate. In addition, for the full year, we\u2019ll be operating in a more challenging freight environment than we saw in 2015. Natural gas and broader commodity prices are expected to remain at low levels and the strength in the U.S. dollar is expected to persist during the year. Furthermore, in 2016, we\u2019ll be cycling a couple of large items that benefited our 2015 results, mainly we received about $100 in liquidated damages and had an $80 million property gain in 2015 which are not expected to recur in 2016. As a result, we currently believe that 2016 earnings per share will be down from last year. Looking at our expectations for 2016, we will continue to right-size resources with lower demand and pursue structural cost opportunities across our network. In addition, we expect to deliver productivity savings of around $200 million in 2016, which builds on the $184 million of productivity that we achieved in 2015. Overall, we remain intensely focused this year on delivering a service product that meets or exceeds our customers\u2019 expectations, achieving strong pricing to support reinvestment in the business and driving efficiencies across our entire cost structure. With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks. Michael Ward : Well, thank you, Frank. CSX has continued to deliver solid results for shareholders, despite the transformational decline in the energy environment and the challenging market conditions. The efforts of our dedicated employees combined with the diversified business mix and the premier network in the east have helped us to overcome the significant losses in coal. As Frank mentioned, 2016 will be a more challenging year. Volume in the first quarter and for the full year will decline as growth in some markets continues to be offset by the significant impact of continued coal declines, low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar. We are taking necessary actions to manage our business in that environment, including making structural and network-wide changes to manage resources and cost with business demand, driving further efficiency gains and remaining focused on strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX\u2019s service. In response to the further challenges expected in 2016, we have also decreased the capital budget by more than $100 million. We expect to invest $2.4 billion this year, as we remain competitive to reserving safety, service and efficiency for customers and communities alike while positioning CSX for the future. As we look to the future, this Company will continue to transition its business toward long-term profitable growth opportunities in the merchandise and intermodal markets. In that regard, we remain focused on achieving a mid-60s operating ratio longer term as we execute our core strategy of meeting or exceeding customer needs to support strong pricing for the value of our rail service, and continuously improving operational efficiency. With those efforts, we are confident that CSX will continue to be a preferred service provider for customers who face a growing population of more integrated global economy and the need for more reliable more sustainable supply chains. Now, we would be glad to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch. Ken Hoexter : Michael, good job in a difficult environment. If I can just talk to you about the outlook here, when you think about earnings going down, I guess can you -- do you have comfort when you look at the economy putting any scale on that? And I guess within that, it seemed like coal and intermodal rate declines were over 8%. I understand fuel and mix were a big part of that. But can you talk about the competitive losses? Is that something where you\u2019re seeing increasing price pressure with that, are we seeing the competition increase their focus on pricing to win some of those intermodal contracts that you noted had been lost? It seems like that the volume or amount of those have been accelerating. Maybe if you can just talk a little bit about that and the outlook. Michael Ward : Good broad question there, Ken. So, Fred, maybe address some of the market conditions. Fredrik Eliasson : In terms of the pricing for the quarter, as you saw, our ex-coal pricing actually improved from the third quarter; went from 4.4% in the third quarter to 4.5% here in the fourth quarter. All-in went down and that really is the reflection of what we did in the export coal market here as we\u2019re now in a position to actually have some surplus asset, again as we get the network running a lot better and very strong service performance, we do have some excess locomotives. We\u2019ve seen the export market deteriorate and as a result of that we felt this is time when we went back and revisited what we could do to optimize our bottom line. And this is one market where we actually don\u2019t have fuel surcharge in. And as a result, the fuel prices have declined throughout the year. We did feel that it was still an opportunity to do a little bit more there and still make money on it. So, what you\u2019re seeing in the pricing side in the all-in is really a reflection of what we do in export coal market. The core pricing actually sequentially improved quarter-over-quarter. Frank Lonegro : Ken, on the EPS, for the year, you\u2019re right, we did guide to EPS being down on a reported basis versus the record $2 a share that we delivered in 2015. We tried to give you guidance in terms of the onetime items that we\u2019re cycling in terms of the liquidated damages in the property sale, the continued transformation in the energy sector. So, we updated the coal guides, both on the domestic side and the export side and then tried to give you some view into the broader economy. And clearly those are on the industrial side being suppressed by the combination of low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar. But this Company\u2019s remained relentlessly focused on driving the things that are most within our control, as you saw our performance this year or 2015 I should say in terms of the rightsizing that we did and the efficiency gains that we delivered in 2015 and the projections of 200 million as we get into 2016. We\u2019ve got an improving service product and Fredrick just mentioned the strong pricing for our shareholders. So, it\u2019s likely going to be a unique year for us in 2016 and after that we fully anticipate EPS growth toward that path of mid-60s longer term. Fredrik Eliasson : And then Ken, in this one very broad question that you asked, I\u2019ll come back to the international losses that we referred to. We\u2019ve had several now over a period of time with us throughout 2016 and as we think about where we are, we\u2019re growing with our existing customers very well but there has been some customers that we\u2019ve lost. And clearly from our perspective, we feel that we have a very strong service product right now. We have what we think is a superior network reach. So, the only thing we can assume is that there are factors outside of our control that has allowed us to lose that traffic. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is open. Brandon Oglenski : Thanks for taking my question, and similarly pretty good results in a difficult environment. So, can we talk more broadly about what could become a manageable level of volume declines where we could think earnings get back to flat; we can get back to operating ratio improvement, or maybe you\u2019re not even suggesting, you can\u2019t get operating ratio improvement this year? But can you talk to levels in the network where you would feel comfortable saying our cost performance and our efficiency plan can get earnings to right-size if not even go up a little bit? Frank Lonegro : I think on a 2016 basis, obviously as I mentioned, it\u2019s going to be a bit of a unique year, continuing resets in the energy environment. And on the operating ratio question for 2016, obviously, it\u2019s going to be difficult to sustain a sub-70 performance especially giving what we\u2019re cycling and the coal projections that we\u2019ve given you and the uncertainty in the industrial economy. But then again, it\u2019s January the 14th, it\u2019s the middle of the first month of the year. We got a great network, as Fredrik\u2019s mentioned we got a track record of success, we have improving service products. So, we\u2019re going to be relentless in terms of our focus on the things that are most within our control. And so those are the things that give us confidence that the future beyond 2016 is a positive one. Brandon Oglenski : Is there any way though to quantify for folks on the call just at a broad level? If volume is down low single digits or mid single digits, does that become more problematic than -- trying to quantify for folks where the loss in earnings [kicks out] [ph]. Michael Ward : Well Brandon, not to be repetitive but obviously the one-timers, clearly those could be easily defined. I think we\u2019ve given very strong guidance as to where we see the coal market this year. Obviously a little bit of potential downside in the export; it\u2019s a little hard to gauge this early. I think probably the wildcard is the rest of the economy. And it is very early in the year to try to gauge that. Obviously I think if you look at most prognosticators, they\u2019re saying the first half of the year probably looks weak on the industrial side but potentially it recovers. And I guess we don\u2019t really have a better crystal ball than that a couple of weeks into the year and that\u2019s probably the wildcard in the entire thing. And we\u2019re going to drive the efficiencies over $200 million; we will take actions to also reflect lower volumes which would be in addition to what we do on the productivity side. And I think with those parameters, this should be able to give you some relative idea of what the expectations could be. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Brian Ossenbeck : I was curious in the 19 million tons per quarter guidance we have in domestic, what level of destocking from inventories do you have kind of reflected in there and whether you\u2019ve outlined some downside risk to export coal? I was just wondering what your thinking is on the domestic side from the utility stockpile and also what level you think natural gas will be? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, I mean obviously we don\u2019t foresee natural gas rebounding significant than from where it is today. And as a result most likely for the rest of the year, we expect our coal plants that we serve to be dispatched last. We are seeing obviously excess stockpiles right now. If we look at where we are, we are probably in the 110s or so in terms of the south and more in the 80 range in the northern part of our network; we should probably be in the 55 to 70 range. So, as we think about that 19 million of domestic coal, it really breaks down into two components, one is the utility coal which is about 14 million tons and steel industrial about 5 million tons to make up the 19. We did about [13.6 here] [ph] in the fourth quarter. And so we\u2019re essentially saying we will continue that run rate. And we expect some destocking to occur over the year but how much really will be dependent on the weather since we now -- dispatch last were essentially peakers, so we\u2019re very much weather dependent. If you have favorable weather conditions from a railroad perspective or utility perspective, then you can see a more significant destocking. If you have continued sort of weather pattern we saw in the fourth quarter where heating degree days were actually off by about 25% to 30% of normal, then that will be much more challenging. But hopefully we won\u2019t see that and we will see some destocking occur within the guidance that we provided. Brian Ossenbeck : And the other one related to gas, that would be coal to gas switching, difficult to tell but from a structural perspective, are there any pockets of the network perhaps in the north near the Marcellus and Utica shale where you would expect to see some more gas plants being built that could perhaps provide a little bit of incremental pressure on the rest of the networks? Fredrik Eliasson : No, I think that all the switching that can occur already occurred back in March or April of last year. What we have seen is in some instances we are seeing some of the coal burners actually now burning some natural gas in conjunction to coal firing it with natural gas that has to have a little bit of an incremental additional negative impact on us. But all the switching that can occur has already occurred. And we are being dispatched last or the utility that we serve are being dispatched last. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Your line is open. Chris Wetherbee : I wanted to ask about the coal network and sort of where you are in terms of potential structural changes that you\u2019re doing. You took some actions in the fourth quarter. I guess I\u2019m curious what else can be done as you move forward to 2016, given the outlook. And then maybe how that ties into productivity and benefits that you\u2019re getting as a great run rate in the fourth quarter. I\u2019m kind of curious what could potentially give upside to that 200 number in 2015. Cindy Sanborn : This is Cindy. As far as structural cost, you did mention the actions that we took in the fourth quarter. And as I talked in our third quarter release, everything is on the table, not just in our coal network but also in our broader footprint and our opportunity that we\u2019re looking forward to drive density, maximize asset utilization and drive out costs. Facilities are still maybe some opportunities there. I think line segments will take a little bit more time; they involve customers and other constituencies there that make those a little bit more longer term. But we are looking at all of these. And as we find opportunities and make announcements, we\u2019ll obviously share that publically. But we have not given up on continuing to find ways to make our footprint much more consistent with the demand that is put on. And you asked another question about productivity, can I ask you to repeat that? Chris Wetherbee : Sure, just wanted to get a sense of maybe how the coal network ties into the productivity, the $200 million of productivity and then given the run rate that you had in the fourth quarter which was bit above that level, how do you think about maybe potential upside; is there more that maybe we could see from productivity in 2016? Thanks. Cindy Sanborn : So, thinking about productivity, we\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to be able to achieve $200 million in productivity savings, in addition to the right-sizing actions that we\u2019re taking. I think when you look at the $200 million in productivity, about $100 million is already -- those initiatives have already been completed and we feel really good about that. And the other initiatives are in slide and we feel good about that. There isn\u2019t necessarily tie or non-tie to the coal network; it\u2019s all -- it\u2019s broad-based and it\u2019s everywhere. And as far as the rightsizing initiatives, I\u2019ll comment on that even it\u2019s not necessarily your question, it might be something you\u2019re thinking about. The way to think about that is fourth quarter is the past is [ph] we\u2019ll be restless on driving out costs that are volume related, as we see demand go down. And then in the opposite, as Michael mentioned, as we see opportunities where demand comes back, we will be able to bring back these resources. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Your line is open. Tom Wadewitz : I wanted to ask you, I guess that how maybe train starts, just a brief follow-on on that and then maybe on pricing. I don\u2019t know if you want to me give me two but the train -- just a quick, how much were train starts down in the fourth quarter, maybe what that could be in 2016? And then on the pricing, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve answered this when Ken was on earlier. But did you give us a sense of what core price and same store price might be in 2016 or is that something that you cannot comment on? Thank you. Fredrik Eliasson : Let me just take the pricing question because that\u2019s probably the simplest one. We don\u2019t forecast pricing we\u2019re going to provide you each and every quarter where we come out. The key thing is that you should know that we always focus on pricing and make sure that we get the appropriate value, so we continue to reinvest in our business. As we think about our pricing right now, we have an incredibly strong service product; it\u2019s improved significantly over the last six months as we now have the resources in place. There is a lot of contracts that we still haven\u2019t been able to touch since really the step function change that occurred in early 2014. The contract side on the trucking side, it\u2019s still holding up, even the spot market is very soft. And the key thing for our team is to continue to sell through this down cycle and make sure we provide value to our customers by selling a longer term commitment in terms of making sure they have access to our network. And so that we work through this down cycle right now and sell for the long-term. Cindy Sanborn : And Tom on starts, I would say probably about thousand starts per week that are scheduled starts will be -- are out. And obviously starts will come out that are volume related more on the unit train side. Tom Wadewitz : Can you give that percentage, like how much -- what percent train starts were down maybe in fourth quarter and what they might be in \u201816? Cindy Sanborn : I don\u2019t have a percentage right in front of me there, Tom. But I can tell you that our train length initiatives have obviously driven a lot of this opportunity and\u2026 Michael Ward : From the beginning of the year, Cindy, about 15%. Cindy Sanborn : For the total year of 2015, they\u2019re up 8% from \u201814 versus \u201815 and in the fourth quarter, they are up 14% from the fourth quarter of \u201814 to the fourth quarter of \u201815. Tom Wadewitz : The decline year-over-year in train starts, you\u2019re saying. Cindy Sanborn : I\u2019m saying train lengths in terms of\u2026 Tom Wadewitz : Train lengths, okay. Cindy Sanborn : Which then translates into the thousands starts per week which we talk about. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Cindy Sanborn : It gives you percentage and gives you some sense of where we stand on a percentage basis. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, yes. I mean those are strong gains, especially given the volume headwind. So, okay, alright. Thank you for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Allison Landry : So, given all the debate surrounding M&A and both of the eastern rails talking about getting to a 65 OR over the next few years and some others saying 60 should be bogie. First, could you help to look in the timeframe for when do you think you can achieve the 65 and what if any your plan is from a longer term perspective to close the gap with your peers to ultimately achieve a 60 OR Frank Lonegro : Allison, it\u2019s Frank. Obviously we can\u2019t comment on what other railroads are projecting into the future. But the challenging environment that we see in 2016 does not in any way diminish our confidence and the ability to deliver the mid 60s operating ratio longer term that we have guided you toward in the past. And again today, as you know, we\u2019ve got an awfully good network, a world-class network in the east. And you\u2019ve seen our success over time, both in terms of delivering margin improvement and the cost takeout that Cindy referenced in addition to the operating side, on the G&A side. So, the effort that we\u2019re taking now especially in an improving environment in the future is going to help us improve margins in a meaningful basis, as that improves. But as we sit here today, based on the forward view of 2016, it just seems a little inappropriate for us to guide on a specific time frame right now. Allison Landry : And I guess just sort of clarification question, do you think that at some point in the future, is there anything structural that would prevent CSX from achieving a 60-OR? Frank Lonegro : We don\u2019t see anything structural that would impede us from getting to the mid-60s and through the mid-60s. Obviously it\u2019s going to depend on a whole host of things. And again as Michael said, the crystal ball is a little cloudy in \u201816. And obviously as that clarity improves, we\u2019ll be able to give you more guidance around that. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be coming from Rob Salmon from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Rob Salmon : Fred, if I could take it back to the intermodal discussion, you had alluded in some international contract losses that have happened through the year. In the guidance, it\u2019s implying roughly 70,000-unit sequential decline which is much more than normal we would see in Q1 versus Q4. Was there an incremental contract loss in the fourth quarter or are you guys contemplating additional inventory destocking that we should be thinking about in the first quarter? Fredrik Eliasson : We have the intermodal business flat, is that what you\u2019re referring to? Rob Salmon : It\u2019s in aggregate intermodal carloads being roughly flat. And so I was just thinking of flattish number and comparing that sequentially to the fourth quarter carloads that we saw. And just curious what\u2019s driving the worse than normal drop off in Q1, whether it\u2019s an incremental international loss or some inventory destocking that you\u2019ve got contemplated or something you\u2019re hearing from customers? Fredrik Eliasson : Sequentially fourth quarter to first quarter is a very different story obviously with the peak that we\u2019re seeing in the fourth quarter, especially around some of our partial business and so forth. So, I think that\u2019s more of a normal thing. If you think about our intermodal business, there is two components to it. We\u2019ve talked about the international side where we have had some competitive losses and you can continue to see that throughout \u201816. However, on the domestic side, we are having good continued success with our H2R initiative, and we\u2019re also seeing some additional outsized growth here over the last probably six months and will probably continue in the first half of next year. But we have one domestic customer that is continuing to shift additional traffic to us which is really a decision that they had made, it\u2019s nothing that we have done to incentivize that. They seem to have wanted to diversify their portfolio. And as a result, we think the domestic business will continue to be strong, at least for the first half of the year and probably beyond that we still think there is opportunity to grow even if that shift subsides. Rob Salmon : And as a follow-up, when do you lap the final piece of the international competitor losses, should I think about that as Q4 of \u201816, or earlier? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, that is correct, Q4 of \u201816. Rob Salmon : And is that the end or beginning? Fredrik Eliasson : No, so, we will have one account that we\u2019re just really kicking and having lost here in the first quarter, so you will see it to hold through all of \u201816. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be coming from Alex Vecchio from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Alex Vecchio : My question is with respect to the guidance for earnings to be down next year. You guys had called out about $180 million of tailwinds in 2015 from property gains and liquidated damages, which is roughly $0.11 to $0.12 a share. So my question is if we were to normalize for those numbers, would you still expect your core, if you will, EPS to be down in 2016 or would it be roughly flat, if we were to normalize for those figures? Frank Lonegro : So, I think we gave you a couple other data points to look at. Clearly, we gave you a new coal guidance today that is down from what we had telegraphed on the third quarter call. So that\u2019s clearly something to think through. And then on the broader merchandise side with the industrial sector a little sluggish here, so that\u2019s in thoughts. But then again on the other side, continued strong pricing for an improved service product and efficiencies and rightsizing, so there is going to be some pluses and minuses as we go forward. But in terms of your original way of thinking about it, I mean you do have to normalize it and then really look at the pluses and minuses from there. Michael Ward : And the other thing I would add to that Alex is obviously over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve been able to grow our other markets to offset the declining coal. So, we\u2019re going to have continuing declining coal here and as uncertain industrial economy. So again, that\u2019s the piece that\u2019s least clear but I think it really depends on what happens with the rest of that market. We know we\u2019ll get the productivity; we know we\u2019ll continue network size properly, we know we\u2019re doing the pricing. So really, the wildcard in that question would be what does the rest of the economy do. Alex Vecchio : And then just a quick follow-up on the first quarter guidance. Can you may be help us quantify little bit how much of year over year tailwind you\u2019d expect lower incentive comps to be on the labor expense line in the first quarter and maybe through 2016. Frank Lonegro : Yes, so obviously on the incentive comp, the plan resets at the beginning of every year. So, we had favorability in the back half of 2015 as the year played out differently than we had originally projected. And we disclosed that to you on a quarterly basis. So, be on the lookout for that one. In terms of the Q1 EPS, obviously based on the cycling of the 100 million in liquidated damages in a different demand environment of the first quarter of \u201815 versus the first quarter of \u201816 especially in coal, that\u2019s going to impact us and the demand environment that we talked about. But again, you\u2019re going to have to look at the improved service and the rightsizing and the efficiencies and the pricing performance, and that will ultimately help us give some guidance in terms of how far quarter one of \u201816 will be down versus reported \u201815. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Jason Seidl from Cowen. Your line is open. Jason Seidl : Fred, I want to go back to something I think you commented about your truck competitor pricing. You mentioned that although truck spot pricing was down, contract was holding up. If contract starts to roll over to sort of meet where spot is, how much pressure is that going to put on intermodal pricing; how should we look at that? Fredrik Eliasson : I do think that we are seeing holding up okay; it\u2019s clearly gotten softer throughout the year on the contract side. And intermodal side, it\u2019s where we do see most of that direct pressure. Now you know that still we have probably 10% to 15% gap between what the truck prices are and what our prices are. And one of the key things in intermodal space is the strong service product. And as we think about our service product here this year entering into \u201816, it is clear that it\u2019s very different than it was a year ago and that is also going to be very helpful as we approach contract season and we put new contracts in place. Jason Seidl : Okay, but in terms of if you just say you make some service improvements and you see the truck pricing take a step down, is it going to be tougher to maintain your pricing even with a superior service product? Fredrik Eliasson : I think we\u2019ve tried to stay away from forecast pricing but directionally you\u2019re right. Obviously the longer this softness is there, the harder it\u2019s going to be to maintain the key challenge for our team is to make sure that our customers are aware that while there\u2019s a softness here right now in \u201816 I think all of us still know that the macro drivers that we talked about for a long time are still prevalent. If we think about some of the productivity challenges that the trucking industry will face is we get to \u201817 with the electronic logs, as unemployment continues to come down, it\u2019s going to be harder to retain the drivers without outsized increases in driver pay. So, we are facing softness; I think also though our customers are acknowledging that that is probably temporary, as some of these macro factors will come back into play. Jason Seidl : Fantastic, and my follow-up, Michael, given the recent comments by the STB on mergers and also the proposed merger or the talked about merger I guess between CP and NS, what\u2019s the likelihood that you see that the current board would approve a combination? Michael Ward : That\u2019s a very timely and difficult question to answer, Jason. As you know, there hasn\u2019t been any mergers under the current regulatory environment. That is a really complicated question; it\u2019s probably better addressed by the STB. But as you saw by their letter last week, they\u2019re going to be very focused on one, the public interest of the potential merger, potential downstream effects. And I think the thing that\u2019s probably the most uncertain but probably going to be there for sure, the question to the extent is what regulatory cost will be put on this merger. Operator : Thanks. Our next question will be coming from Matt Troy from Nomura Securities. Your line is open. Matt Troy : I just wanted to ask with respect to pricing obviously, rail\u2019s peripherally or tangentially tied to the commodity super cycle which is winding down; you\u2019ve got some more bearish people out there talking about rail pricing being vulnerable, anecdotes of carriers cutting price to incent volume. I just wanted to hear from you or confirm with you that you still remain committed to inflation plus type pricing, consistent with similar years and that there hasn\u2019t been in change in thought or philosophy that perhaps price might be a lever you might use to incent volume in 2016. Fredrik Eliasson : No. I think our philosophy is still there hasn\u2019t changed in terms of making sure that we do value price in the -- the value provide to our customers and being able to continue to reinvest in our business. At the end of the day, it goes back to what is the second best option for our customers from a service and a price perspective. As we think through each one of them, we still think that we have an opportunity to continue to make sure we get the pricing that we need to getting to reinvest in our business, which benefits both our shareholders but also our customers as we continue to strengthen our infrastructure. It\u2019s one market where we have consistently said that it makes sense in this commodity downturn to be flexible because we\u2019ve seen\u2019 we\u2019ve got additional demand by doing so. And that\u2019s our export coal market. And we\u2019ve taken some additional action here in the fourth quarter to reflect a very, very difficult and challenging environment for them. But in the rest of the markets, we\u2019ll work with our customers in partnership and try to figure out what the best service product is and at the same time also make sure we get the appropriate price. So, I would say that nothing has changed in terms of the philosophy that you\u2019ve seen here from CSX for more than a decade. Matt Troy : And then I guess my quick follow-up would be the intermodal growth, obviously you spoke at length about the loss in international but the domestic of \u201814 was a fantastic number. You kind of have tale of two railroads when you look at average volumes in fourth quarter, you guys were up mid single-digit; your competitors were down. So obviously domestic, you alluded to a contract moving over on its own, not you incenting it. Just wondering if you could talk about that 14% really high level directionally, how much of that growth would be that singular contract which you have seen shift and how much of it would be what I\u2019d refer to as more organic highway to rail conversion? Thank you. Michael Ward : It is a significant portion of that growth. I think that prior to last year, we\u2019ve been growing our domestic intermodal business about 7% and we\u2019ve guided long-term to about 5% to 10%. And with a softer market, we\u2019re probably at the low end of that range, if you exclude this shift. But nothing has changed in terms of our opportunity to convert what we\u2019ve said is over 9 million units in our network territory that we think over time can be converted to a rail based solution in partnership with our truckers. And so, we think it\u2019s softer right now. But as I said to previous -- answered to previous question, the macro environment still favors a rail based solution longer term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities. Your line is open. Cherilyn Radbourne : My first question is on your variable train scheduling initiative and just how much of an impact that had in the increase in train lengths that you saw and what inning you think we\u2019re in, in terms of realizing whole benefit? Cindy Sanborn : I think as far as the variable trains which that has -- that applies to our merchandise network, I think we\u2019ve seen the biggest increase in train size in the merchandise side. So in the fourth quarter, we saw increase in the train side of 23%. So, I think what the variable schedule does for us going forward is as we see softer demand we are able to right-size that network more effectively. In terms of what the components are of variable train that are in place, we pretty much got them in place but it does allow us to continue to shift and expand and contract on a more effective way than we\u2019ve been able to do in the past in our merchandise network. Michael Ward : And you\u2019re doing a lot more in the bulk. Cindy Sanborn : Yes, we\u2019re also continuing train length initiatives on the bulk side as well. We\u2019ve seen increases in train lengths across coal, grain and others in the 5% to 10% range also over the quarter. So, it\u2019s not just a merchandised -- train length is not just a merchandise initiative, it also follows the rest but merchandise has seen the biggest benefits. Cherilyn Radbourne : And then to the extent that you expect earnings to decline in 2016 and see some volume uncertainty, can you just comment on whether that will have any impact on the pace at which you expect to execute on your share buyback program? Frank Lonegro : You saw us repurchase 9 million shares in the quarter or just under 260 million which was essentially the same rate that you saw us in the third quarter and it\u2019s consistent with the $2 billion program that we announced back in April. And we currently expect to complete that program ratably over the next five quarters, using balance sheet cash, free cash flow and debt. So, I think you\u2019re going to continue to see us based on what we see now to continue on that ratable program. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Ben Hartford from Baird. Your line is open. Ben Hartford : Just quick question on the export coal side. In your mind, what is the risk to further downside? You obviously talked about some downside risk to the 20 million tons number this year but what provides any comfort that you have line of sight to a floor and that we shouldn\u2019t be thinking about, the early 2000 levels of a number less than half, this guided 2016 number or even something above and beyond the 2002, 2003 levels? Is there any way to -- obviously the market is uncertain, but is there any way to frame up the likelihood of a 50% or even deeper cut to the export coal number over the course of the next few years? Michael Ward : I think that over the last couple of years, as we provided you guidance at beginning of the year, we\u2019ve been actually very, very close to those numbers. And while these are uncharted territory in terms of underlying commodity prices, both on the thermal side and the met side, we do work very closely with our customers, both on the producer side and also with some of the agent to sell for us and really try to go over and understand the markets themselves. As we think about this \u201816 right now, out of the 20 million, we probably have about 6 million that we have very good visibility to, probably little bit lower than you normally would have at this time of the year but we still think that there is an opportunity to get to that about 20 million tons for the year. And one of the drivers here is also that you do have such a large excess surplus of domestic coal where the producers are very eager to push that out to the market and that is helpful as well as we move through 2016. Ben Hartford : Frank, share buyback, what is the thought process there this year? And then, I want to confirm something on the CapEx side that the 307 million from the 113 locos that were purchased late last year; is that in the 2016 CapEx budget of $2.4 billion? Frank Lonegro : So the answer to your last question is yes. And on the buybacks, it\u2019s the same ratable methodology that you heard us talk about previously. And so, the $2 billion program was intended to be over two-year period. And as we currently see things, we\u2019ll continue to do it at about 260 a quarter. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is open. David Vernon : Fredrick, maybe just to put some more numbers on the issue around utility coal pricing, if you look back over the last couple of years when you\u2019ve seen the utility business get cut by half or so. Can you talk about the trend you guys have seen in your distance neutral rate per ton; has that been moving up or have you seen some weaker years went because of the lower gas price? Just trying again put some numbers around the utility coal pricing. Fredrik Eliasson : So clearly, in mid part of last decade, there was a significant opportunity to a touch legacy pricing and that probably lasted from 2005 to 2011 or so. And then since then, it\u2019s been much more normalized pricing. As natural gas prices now come down as much as they have, there really isn\u2019t much that we can do to incentivize incremental burn. We look at each and every contract when they come up to see if there are opportunities to optimize the bottom line but being more flexible in pricing. And if there is, we will do that. But generally, at these natural gas prices, there isn\u2019t really anything we can do to improve the burn rates with maybe one or two exceptions. David Vernon : And then maybe Frank, just as a follow-up on the productivity, can you talk a little bit about how dependent the level of productivity you\u2019re getting right now is on the CapEx budget? It sounds like some of the new locomotives that you\u2019re getting are necessary to run a longer train. And I\u2019m just wondering about how much more upgrading of the fleet may be required over the next few years? And when that CapEx get down to 16%, 17%? Frank Lonegro : So, on the locomotive piece, obviously we\u2019ll complete the deliveries in 2016, as Cindy has mentioned, we\u2019ve certainly looked at rightsizing the fleet and taking out the bad actors and the high fuel burn locomotives. So, it certainly helps but you\u2019re talking about 300 engines on a 4,000 engine base. On your tie between productivity and CapEx, there is always some in the CapEx budget that relates to productivity and it\u2019s really I would say dog\u2019s breakfast. You\u2019ve got structural changes in the coal network; you\u2019ve got G&A restructuring and downsizing; you\u2019ve got terminal efficiencies; you\u2019ve got training length which gives you lower crew stars as we mentioned earlier in the call; you\u2019ve got technology initiatives which are funded through the CapEx process that relate into some of the productivity initiatives. So, I think you\u2019re looking at a lot of things that we did in 2015 that will carry over into 2016 and then there is a little bit of a tie between CapEx and productivity. But it\u2019s small in the grand scheme of things, David. In terms of long term and getting back down to 16% to 17%, if you were to normalize this year\u2019s capital budget for the 300 million in locomotive payments, you\u2019d be at that range now. So it\u2019s certainly something that on a long term basis we\u2019re going to continue to look at. Fuel surcharge that\u2019s come down has obviously been a bit of a headwind for us in the past as we look at that 16% to 17%. David Vernon : And I guess just as a short follow-up to that, and in the number of the 300 locomotives you\u2019ve taken against the 4,000 fleets, if you had a capital unconstrained world and you wanted to go and push trail lengths in other parts of the business, would there be opportunities to go ahead and continue to upgrade that fleet and operationally find opportunities to run longer trains in other parts of the network or are you nearing the end of the ability to get that extra productivity from train lengths? Cindy Sanborn : The train length constraints really are not locomotive base; they are sighting capacity based in the southern part of our network. And in terms of capital, we\u2019re looking at those types of investments going forward to allow us to unlock the value of longer trains. So, it\u2019s really not locomotive based. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from John Larkin from Stifel. Your line is open. John Larkin : I wanted to dig a little bit more into the stated objective of producing another 200 million in productivity savings in 2016. Could we talk a little bit about how that might be spread over the year and how much of that is tied to the rationalization of the coal network and whether the rationalization of the coal network also would envision potential abandonments and/or sales to short lines on some wider density lines in the coal network? Cindy Sanborn : So from a productivity perspective, the 200 million is again as I said initiative based, a 100 million is pretty much, those initiatives are in place. Two of those are one area that is included is the actions that we took in the fourth quarter on the reduction in volume across the Erwin gateway and the closure of the Corbin locomotive facility. So to the extent those are obviously in the coal fields that is an impact to productivity in 2016 around both facilities reduction and facilities and headcount reduction. So that\u2019s basically the way I see 2016 looking with productivity. As far as continued rationalization in the coal fields, as I said, we\u2019re going to look at that not just in the coal fields but broadly, whether it\u2019s facility related and/or line segment. The line segments take a little bit longer to work through; they involve customers; they involve other constituencies. So, as we make those determinations and make those decisions, we\u2019ll be very public with that information but that\u2019s more longer term. John Larkin : So, the 200 million will be folded in pretty much evenly across all four quarters, is that a way to think about it? Cindy Sanborn : I would say it\u2019s right, John, yes. Easiest way to think about it. Operator : Your next question will be coming from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Bascome Majors : I wanted to take a directional look at the margin profile of the coal business; it looks like from your guidance, tonnage is going to be -- if you\u2019re at your guidance for the year, tonnage will be down 45% or so. For the entire business, it\u2019s 2011. Can you just talk a little bit about the balance within the segment of the margin profile between the export business today after the price cuts you\u2019ve taken over the several years, and the domestic business where you transition to the fixed-variable contract structure? And also more broadly where is coal comping versus the rest of the book today? Is it still your premium business up there with chemicals or has the profile fallen down the ladder a bit as the revenues have fallen? Thank you. Fredrik Eliasson : Back in 2012 or so, we used to say that our export and utility business was about the same level of contribution and on a margin basis. But since then as we have adjusted export rates significantly down, our utility book of business has a higher margin than the export business. If you look at the overall portfolio of coal versus the rest of the business, I would say that it\u2019s still clearly more profitable because of the fact that it\u2019s such an efficient way for us to move the cargo have a tonnage, just the unit train back and forth is very-very efficient for us to operate that way. And so, it\u2019s still at the high end of our business. Bascome Majors : As my follow-up here and maybe for Michael or Clarence if he\u2019s in the room, I understand you guys are railroaders; you\u2019re not economists here but just looking at the volume declines you\u2019re seeing today, both the depth of them and the breadth, have you ever seen an environment like this in your business or careers outside of a recession? Michael Ward : It\u2019s Michael; I\u2019ll answer that although Clarence is here. So, if you take out the recession, no, we\u2019ve not seen these kinds of pressures in so many different markets because you have multiple aspects working against you. The low gas prices; the low commodity prices; the strength of the dollar, all three of those together are really pushing. And in some ways, I think you can almost think of it as a straight recession, except for say markets like automotive and housing related, you\u2019re seeing pressure on most of the markets. So clearly outside of a recession, this is one where we\u2019re seeing lots of pressure in lots of different markets. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Jeff Kauffman from Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Jeff Kauffman : First of all congratulations, I mean just a very difficult quarter. I thought you guys did a great job on the cost side. I wanted to zero in on the changing coal guidance for next year. If I look at kind of what\u2019s changed, I think you were talking around kind of a 21 million ton domestic run rate going down to 19, so that\u2019s about an 8 million ton change. But it really looks like almost half of that drop was on the coking coal and domestic met side. So two questions, number one, when I look at domestic, how much of that change is your view on utility versus your view on kind of other domestic coal? And when I look at the exports, you did about 31 million this year; the guidance is for 20 million. Can I look at end markets and can we think about it that way in terms of where has the incremental demand ebbed for your export coal geographically? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, you\u2019re right. If you go back to the third quarter guidance that we did at the call, we essentially said 21 million tons per quarter of domestic which was 15 of domestic -- of utility and 6 of steel and industrial, and we said then about our export was about 6 million tons a quarter for 24 in total. So, we\u2019ve essentially seen a deterioration in all of those three markets by about 1 million tons a quarter. And it\u2019s really reflection of the fact that natural gas prices and the very mild fourth quarter in the utility side has dampened our expectations. On the steel and industrial side, it\u2019s the reflection of the fact that when we look at the steel industry right now, having utilization of about 60% versus 75% a year ago and we saw it deteriorate throughout the fourth quarter. And on the export market, it\u2019s also just reflection of the fact that underlying commodity indexes are telling us that market has gotten softer as global oversupply continues. So, in terms of where the export market is going, we did about 60-40 split here between met and thermal. They\u2019d probably be a little bit higher next year will be my guess at this point in terms of probably one-third, two-third, two-thirds in favor of met. And traditionally over a half of our business goes to Europe. And I\u2019d say that split is probably going to continue in terms of the end market as well. And so, I think it\u2019s just proportional between markets and I think you\u2019re going to see relatively proportional count in terms of the end markets as well. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Group : So, Fredrik, just wanted to ask about the coal yield, so I thought that the fixed-variable was supposed to help in environments like this when volumes are down so much and help the yields out, why aren\u2019t we seeing that? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, in the third quarter, they were helpful actually. They were still helpful here in the fourth quarter but not as much because some of this also depends on who you are actually shipping to. And the big driver though in the coal yields was really the fact that we have made these accommodations on the export side and further adjusted our rates downward to reflect the reality of the underlying market and thing trying to optimize our bottom line. Scott Group : And then Michael, I just want to ask, so a lot\u2019s changed -- certainly a lot\u2019s of changed in the market from year, year and half. Since your view or appetite on M&A changed at all or has it changed it all in that year and year and half? Michael Ward : Not really, Scott. If you think about it, I think our position is the same, as it was a year or year and half ago. We think there is tremendous opportunity for shareholder value creation with our existing portfolio. And if you think about any mergers, there\u2019s going to be substantial regulatory cost, some of the synergies will be very limited because they are end to end mergers. So, if you are going to offset those regulatory costs, you\u2019ve got to have compelling interfaces of synergies. And I really have a hard time envisioning where that would be in any rail merger. Scott Group : So that the challenge is that the markets don\u2019t change your view on that. Michael Ward : No, sir. I think we\u2019ve done well in prior down periods; we think we will in this one as well. And we think the long-term future with our existing customer base two thirds of the population we serve, pressures on the trucking, the service improvements we continue to make in the pricing, allows to create lots of value for the shareholders over the intermediate long-term. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Justin Long from Stephens. Your line is open. Justin Long : So you talked about cycling the benefits from liquidated damages and gains on sales this year. And just taking those items out to someone\u2019s point earlier, you get to a mid single-digit EPS decline in 2016 along with anticipated volume declines, mix headwinds, your commentary that it will be difficult to improve the OR. Is it fair to say that EPS should be down at least double-digits or low double-digits this year? Michael Ward : Yes, all we\u2019re prepared to talk you about today is the directional piece, what we try to do is to give you some clarity around the moving parts that we have, obviously certainty on the cycling piece and we have we think good insights into the coal sector. It\u2019s really what happens in the industrial space, especially as we get out into the second half of the year. And again it\u2019s really, really early in the year in an uncertain environment to project full year EPS with specificity. At the same time, as you look at the things that we\u2019re doing, the pricing performance, the productivity, the rightsizing, the service improvements and all of those things are the things that are most within our control. And those are the things that you are going to see us be relentless about. Justin Long : And as a quick follow-up, I wanted to ask about PTC, you mentioned the $300 million of anticipated spending this year and $2.2 billion in total but of that total amount, what\u2019s remaining after 2016? And after you\u2019ve fully installed the technology, do you anticipate any incremental maintenance cost associated with PTC that would be ongoing? Michael Ward : So, let me give you the facts and the figures on PTC. So a $1.5 billion is what we spent through the end of \u201815, we\u2019ve given you the $300 million guidance for \u201816 so that would take you upto the $1.8 billion through the end of this year. Our project takes us to a hardware completion date of 2018 and fully operational by 2020. I think you will see the majority of the difference between the 1.8 billion and the 2.2 billion being spent between now -- excuse me, end of \u201816 and the end of \u201818. In terms of the tail on OpEx and some refresh CapEx, we\u2019re still working through that. Obviously there is a piece that\u2019s embedded within depreciation as well as in departmental operating expenses. And that\u2019s still being worked on right now as we understand the support agreements that will go along with the hardware and the software as well as the useful life on those pieces of equipment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Cleo Zagrean from Macquarie. Your line is open. Cleo Zagrean : So the follow-up already since the recent conversation, let\u2019s imagine ourselves this time next year after the lower earnings base set by \u201816 and I am not asking for guidance but conceptually how do you see the new growth trend? Can we see double digit sustainable EPS growth or should we think of maturing into a pattern of lower growth, maybe more distributions for shareholders? Because we\u2019ve been talking about the structural changes not in a so called recession such as lower profitability from coal, consumer spending, shifting more towards services, probably sustainable strong dollar, sluggish industrial economy. So, what is the new normal and how can you grow in that? Thank you. Frank Lonegro : From just an EPS directional thinking beyond 2016, we see 2016 as again a unique year. And clearly we should be able to provide strong EPS growth off of a 2016 base. And I\u2019ll allow Fredrick to comment on some of the commercial items of your question in terms of where some of the various lines of business might be going? Fredrik Eliasson : So, as we go through this year and cycle some of these headwinds that we\u2019re going to be facing, clearly for the first half of this year and we look at where the macroeconomic indicators are and projection for the U.S. dollar, I think we\u2019ll start seeing things stabilize, normalize and we can start seeing year-over-year growth as we move through hopefully late in 2016 and clearly move into \u201817. Based on what we\u2019re seeing right now, as Frank I think has said many times throughout the call today and Michael as well, the key thing for us right now is the focus on the things that we can hold the most. And then the macro headwinds are going to be whatever they are and the key thing for us is to adjust our infrastructure to reflect the reality of what they provide us. Cleo Zagrean : And as a follow-up, can you talk to us about the rate at which you\u2019d see investing in growth opportunities? And maybe what it would take for you to consider higher sustainable dividend yield to appeal to more broadly to dividend focused investors? Thank you. Michael Ward : On the capital side, clearly there is a portion of our capital budget every year that is geared toward growth investments. The majority of that over recent years has been focused on our growth engine and that\u2019s on the intermodal, especially in domestic intermodal side. So, you will continue to see us focused in that area. In terms of dividends, I would say currently where we are, we have a very healthy yield. We have guidance out there in terms of what we\u2019re willing to pay out on a trailing 12 months basis and that\u2019s in the 30% to 40% of trailing 12 months earnings. And so we look at that every year, generally speaking after the first quarter and we\u2019ll continue to do that and look at where we are against the broader environment. Operator : Thank you. And the last question will be coming from Keith Schoonmaker from Morningstar. Your line is open, sir. Keith Schoonmaker : Your expectations for automotive are scarce bright spot as were actual auto shipments last year. Could you please add some color to this growth expectation, maybe particular locations where you\u2019re seeing some strengths, as well as perhaps comment on general shifts of production to Mexico and how that affects your network? Thank you. Fredrik Eliasson : So if you look at the North America light vehicle production, I think we\u2019re earning up about 17.5 here in \u201815 and the projection is for 18.2 next year, so that provides us good growth opportunities; U.S. sales also based on the projections that we\u2019re seeing indicates good growth. The Mexico shift is clear, so the North American light vehicle production numbers are probably skewed a little bit more towards Mexico which we don\u2019t capture as much but we still capture some of that. And sometimes that is actually a length of how it vantage for us, so that is helpful. So overall, if you go back in history over the last 30-40 years, I am sure that you will find our core relation in North America light vehicle production is probably in the very-very high 95%, 98%. So, we follow what producers tell us and then we adjust our fleet and service accordingly. And right now, it looks like we\u2019re going to have another year of growth but not anywhere closer to where it\u2019s been since \u201809 but still nice growth and especially in this environment; we need these sorts of growth opportunities. A - Michael Ward : Well, thank you everyone for joining us and we will talk to you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s call.

Baird Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research Justin Long - Stephens Inc. Tyler Brown - Raymond James Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners John Barnes - RBC Capital Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the CSX Corporation First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. David Baggs : Thank you, Nicole, and good morning, everyone. And welcome again to CSX Corporation\u2019s first quarter 2016 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we\u2019ll be reviewing this morning along with our expanded quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at CSX.com under the Investors section. In addition, following the presentation this morning, a webcast replay will be available on that same website. This morning, our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Frank Lonegro, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Cindy Sanborn, our Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer along with Clarence Gooden, our President, will be available during the question-and-answer session. Now, before I turn the presentation over to Michael, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company\u2019s disclosure and the accompanying presentation on slide two. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements, as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. With nearly 30 analysts covering CSX and out of respect for everyone\u2019s time, including our investors, I would ask as a courtesy for you to please limit your inquiries to one question and if necessary, a clarifying question on that same topic. And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael? Michael Ward : Well thank you David. Good morning everyone. Yesterday CSX reported first quarter earnings per share of $0.37 compared to $0.45 per share in the same period last year. Revenue declined 14% in the quarter; a strong pricing across nearly all markets reflecting an improving service product was more than offset by the impact of lower fuel recovery, market conditions that drove a 5% volume decline, including a 31% decline in coal, and a $95 million year-over-year decline in liquidated damages. Turning to operations, CSX remained an industry leader in safety and service measurements continue to advance in the quarter, consistent with our service excellence initiative to meet and exceed customer expectations. Expenses improved 12%, driven by lower fuel prices as well as efficiency gains and lower volume related costs, reflecting CSX\u2019s ongoing drive to aggressively reduce its cost structure, as we continue to reshape the company in face of this challenging market environment. Including the impact of these cost saving actions finding liquidated damages, operating income decreased $139 million to $704 million for the quarter. At the same time, the operating ratio increased 90 basis points year-over-year to 73.1. Now I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Frank, who will take us through the results and second quarter outlook in more detail. Frank Lonegro : Thank you Michael and good morning everyone. Let me begin by providing more detail on our first quarter results. As Michael mentioned revenue was down 14% or $409 million versus the prior year. With coal declining 31%, total volume decreased 5% from last year which impacted revenue by about $140 million. In addition, fuel surcharge recoveries declined $139 million. We continue to see strong coal pricing from an improving service product which for the first quarter was up 3.1% overall and 4.0% excluding coal. However these gains were more than offset by the impact of negative business mix in the quarter. Other revenue decreased $85 million, driven mainly by cycling higher liquidated damages from last year, which totaled $105 million versus $10 million in this year\u2019s first quarter. Expenses decreased 12% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $133 million in efficiency gains, $78 million in lower fuel prices and $64 million in lower volume related costs. Operating income was $704 million in the first quarter, down 16% versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income was relatively flat to the prior year. And finally income taxes were $212 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. Overall, net earnings were $356 million down 19% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.37 per share down 18% versus last year. Now let me turn to the market outlook for the second quarter. Looking forward we again expect volumes to decline in the second quarter, the challenging freight environment will continue as headwinds in coal, energy and metals volume are expected to more than offset the markets that will show growth. Automotive is expected to grow, as light vehicle production continues to be a bright spot in the economy. Minerals will benefit from the continued ramp up of the new fly ash remediation project and continued highway construction, driving aggregate movement. Intermodal is expected to be neutral, as we continue to cycle competitive international losses. This will be offset by secular domestic growth, driven by strategic investments and supporting highway to rail conversion. Chemicals volume is expected to decline, as energy markets continue to be marked by low crude oil prices and reduced drilling activity, which will impact our share related products more significantly in the second quarter. At the same time, the core chemical markets remain healthy. Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by low natural gas prices currently around $2 and high levels of coal inventory at the utilities. As a result, we expect second quarter tonnage to be around 18 million tons. In addition, we anticipate a similar quarterly run rate for the second half, recognizing domestic coal volume will be largely dependent on weather. Export coal remains pressured by the strong US dollar and global oversupply, as a result we believe second quarter tonnage will be around 4 million to 5 million tons and expect a similar run rate for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we now expect around 18 million tons to 20 million tons of export coal in 2016. Despite a slowly recovering domestic steel production environment, metals is expected to be unfavorable year-over-year as the market works off excess supply from the strong US dollar and imported product. Overall we are still facing significant coal headwinds and a freight environment that continues to experience pronounced challenges associated with historically low crude oil, natural and other commodity prices and a strong US dollar. As a result, we expect second quarter volume to decline in the mid-to-high single digit range year-over-year. Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the second quarter. We expect second quarter expense to benefit from the low fuel price environment and our ongoing focus on driving efficiency gains and right sizing resources as we continue to reshape the company. Over the course of the last 12 months, we have taken aggressive cost actions with headcount down nearly 4500 versus the prior year. These actions include our train length initiative, closing facilities in the coal network, consolidating a division headquarters and streamlining mechanical and operations support functions. These actions along with cycling the impact of winter weather last year through high efficiency gains in excess of $130 million seen here in the first quarter. And for the full year, we now expect to deliver efficiency gains of around $250 million. Looking at labor and fringe, we expect second quarter average headcount to stay relatively flat sequentially. We expect labor inflation to be around $25 million in the second quarter in line with the level seen here in the first quarter. Looking at MS&O expense, we expect inflation and the cycling of an operating property gain from last year to more than offset efficiency gains and volume related savings. Fuel expense in the second quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon, reflecting the current price environment; volume related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the second quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. Finally, equipment and other rents in the second quarter is expected to increase moderately from last year, with higher freight car rates and the increase in volume related costs associated with automotive growth, more than offsetting improved car cycle times. Now let me wrap up on the next slide. CSX first quarter reflect challenging freight conditions with low commodity prices and a strong US dollar continuing to impact most markets, resulting in a 5% volume decline this quarter. However, as we continue to reshape the company, our focus on pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment help to offset those volume headwinds. Looking ahead, we expect macroeconomic and coal headwinds to continue this year. Low commodity prices and the strength of the US dollar are expected to continue impacting many of CSX\u2019s market; in particular we now expect total coal volume to decline around 25% for the full year. Looking at our expectations for the second quarter and full year, the impact of current market conditions on CSX volume, particularly in coal is expected to outweigh the positive momentum we are seeing in service which drives pricing efficiency and right sizing initiatives. In the second quarter, we expect mid-to-high single digit volume declines with efficiency gain moderating from the level seen here in the first quarter. For the full year, in addition to liquidated damages we cycled during the first quarter, as we previously discussed we will also be cycling a significant property transaction in the fourth quarter. As a result, we continue to expect second quarter and full year 2016 earnings per share to be down from last year. That\u2019s said, we remain intensely focused on achieving strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX service product, right sizing resources with lower demand and pursing structural cost opportunities across the network. In particular, the aggressive cost actions we have taken over the last 12 months has helped to mitigate the challenging freight environment and weaker volumes. As a result of these initiatives, we now expect to deliver efficiency savings of around $250 million in 2016. With that let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks. Michael Ward : Thank you Frank. As I think about CSX first quarter performance, it\u2019s clear that the company\u2019s core earning power remained strong, even in an environment in which macroeconomic forces are putting significant pressure on most of our markets. We know 2016 will be a challenging year, and we are focused on delivering the highest level of performance and results possible. In this environment, CSX continues to reshape its business and network for the economy of tomorrow, maximizing growth opportunities in merchandize and intermodal, while also improving the profitability of these markets to help offset the loss of coal. As we look forward, this team is resolute in its commitment to further transform today\u2019s company. The CSX of tomorrow is built on the strength of premiere network reaching diverse, merchandise and intermodal markets. It is focused on delivering service excellence for our customers to support pricing that allows us to continue investing for the next generation and drive ever more efficient operations. And we will leverage technology to further improve safety, service and efficiency, as we continue to evolve our business for the realities of tomorrow economy. As we make decisions today to make that vision of tomorrow a reality, we remain focused on achieving a mid-60s operating ratio longer term and delivering compelling value for you our shareholders. Now I would be glad to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Sir your line is open. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley : A question on the productivity savings, clearly your first quarter performance was pretty amazing with the 133 compared to the full year run rate. You did bump up the full year by less than you kind of exceeded your prior guidance for 1Q. Can you just talk about the cadence for the rest of the year and why that appears to step down so much versus the fourth quarter number? Cindy Sanborn : Sure. This is Cindy. I think we\u2019re off to a great start which reflects a lot of hard work by all of our teams to bring the $130 million of productivity in the first quarter. And as I think about how 2015 progressed, we had a lot of initiatives that we started in the beginning of the second quarter and on in to the third quarter around right sizing of our coal facility as well as our train length initiatives. So we\u2019ll be bumping up against those comps going forward, and I also would say there were some benefit to milder ones for this year than what we had on 2015 in the first quarter. That said, we are never done in working on our productivity initiatives and with the pace of change here has intensified, accelerated and we will continue to bring everything to the bottom line that we can, keeping in mind that we have to balance that we\u2019re serving customers and we won\u2019t compromise safety in that effort. And as we go forward and you think about the run rate going forward of $40 million or $50 million in the next three quarters, that is higher than our historical run rate with the exception of 2015 in terms of productivity that we\u2019ll be able to deliver. So if there\u2019s more to get, we will absolutely get it and we\u2019ll be able to update you on that if we see that in the future conversations either on the quarterly or on Frank\u2019s roadshows. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley : If I can just ask one question on coal, what\u2019s your outlook for the rest of the year? Obviously you\u2019ve given us your guidance, but going in to 70 and 80, just any new thoughts on the outlook coal in the medium term. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure, this is Fredrik. We guided to about 25% down for the full year. We did on the domestic side here in the first quarter, did about 17 million tons and our view as we think about the next couple of quarters, we like to think that we\u2019re going to be definitely 17-18 million ton range on the domestic side. And then on export side, we did almost 6 million tons in the first quarter. Traditionally the first quarter is a little bit stronger than the other quarters; at least it\u2019s been like that for the last couple of years. We also enjoyed some spot moves here in the first quarter that we don\u2019t necessarily see in the remaining three quarters, so maybe 4 million to 5 million tons a quarter on the export side. So that gives us 22 million to 23 million range for coal guidance per quarter as we move through the year versus the 23 million tons we did in the first quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. You may now ask your question. Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch : Just wanted to follow-up on the employees. Great job on the larger than expected reduction down 14%, but maybe if you can walk us through, why was the average cost per employee up? Last few quarters I guess we\u2019ve seen it down 5% to 9%, this quarter it was up. May be you can talk a little bit about what\u2019s in that number in terms of comp or anything else that drives and what should we look forward for that going forward. Thanks. Frank Lonegro : Ken its Frank. You\u2019re right; headcount was down about 13%-14%, while the labor and fringe line was down about 9% or 10%. So your comp per employee is about 4% or 5% higher. There\u2019s a couple of driver, some of those are industry related and some of those are CSX specific. Clearly you have general wage inflation of 4% a year or so, and then with probably as the biggest driver for us health and welfare inflation. As the industry is reducing resources, you\u2019ve got fewer employees to spread the health and welfare cost over. So both of those are industry in nature. In terms of maybe some CSX specific dynamics, as you furlough employee, generally those are going to be your less tenured employees with lower all-in wages and then may be as a last point Ken, when you at a year-over-year number of employees in training, there were significantly more employees in training in the year ago quarter than there are currently, just given sort of where we are on the resource side and training pays less than marked-up pays. So you got three or four moving parts in there that hopefully answers your question. Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch : So just on the coal market, Michael can you look forward and tell us. I know you\u2019ve talked in the past about mass gas-fired plant closing that were mandated in \u201915 and \u201916. Is there something that now is done and we should see that pace decelerate as you look forward. I just wanted to say, there was a great answer by Fredrik on what we\u2019re seeing now. But I just want to understand it, there\u2019s something else that is connected. Can you drive this, is this just market dynamics as far as closings or are there more that\u2019s going to structurally change the market and continue the pace we\u2019ve seen on the decline. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure Ken, this is Fredrik. Frankly, based on this very low demand levels we\u2019re seeing as we go through plant by plant and look at their closures that we expect at \u201916, \u201917 and \u201918 which really covers all the announced closures that we have on our network. Based on the outlook that we have for the rest of the year now which is consistent with the guidance, there\u2019s only less than 1 million tons that we have in for those plants that have announced to close, which means that the closure side of things is really behind us to a very large degree as we move forward because of the fact that the demand levels are so low. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is now open. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital : Can you guys help us on the top line? I know you\u2019re talking about mid-to-high volume declines for 2Q, but how do we think about the contribution from price within the headwinds from mix. Does that get easier or more challenging as we progress through the year? Fredrik Eliasson : This is Fredrik again. Yes, the second quarter and probably even third quarter are going to be challenging quarters from the volume perspective. It\u2019s not really until we get to the fourth quarter we will have a little bit easier comparisons year-over-year both on the coal side and on the general merchandize side as well. We\u2019re going to have a negative mix with us as long as our coal business is declining as fast as it is and our intermodal business is growing as fast as it is. Clearly, we are very transparent about what we\u2019re doing from a pricing perspective, and that\u2019s going to continue to be helpful as we move through the year. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital : I guess what I was getting to as more from the top line perspective, should we be thinking a similar outcome then what makes us - I think you\u2019ve referred this in our prepared remarks that mix might offset the favorable impact on pricing looking forward. So topline could be down a little bit more than volume. Fredrik Eliasson : Well I think as you try to model out what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re kind of giving you the individual components. And the one piece we haven\u2019t talked about is of course fuel as well. So you got to put those pieces yourself, we\u2019re very explicit in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in each individual market, we certainly expect continued strong pricing as we move forward and then of course we have the variance of fuel or whatever that is going to do. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Brian Ossenbeck - JP Morgan : A quick question on the impact of the dollar, the trade weighted index was about 5% off from the peak. Are you still calling out some pretty negative headwinds when [you turn] on commodity prices both on the exports and on disruptive imports. Do you think if it stays at this level Fredrik that we\u2019ll start to see some relief towards the end of the year or do you think you need another 5% down move to really get some relief from some of these commodity markets. Fredrik Eliasson : Well the dollar\u2019s still well above its 10 year average of so forth, but it is clear that it\u2019s been helpful in certain areas the fact that it has taken a step back to last two months or so. One area where we had seen that is in the export coal side on the metallurgical side with a benchmark actually has stepped up a little bit from I think the low [$0.81] in Queensland index trading forward and I think the bench where some of the spot moves are actually even higher than that at this point. And we\u2019re also seeing, well it\u2019s not directly dollar related, some of the potential tariff and counter (inaudible) that we\u2019re seeing in the metals business, we\u2019re starting to see drive down some of the in-portions of the country which is starting slowly but surely to I think to heal our metals business as well. But it is fair to say that even with that sort of a relief over the last two months on the dollar; you\u2019re looking in to the fourth quarter I think until you\u2019re going to start seeing meaningful improvements in the volume performance. Brian Ossenbeck - JP Morgan : And then on the productivity side, you mentioned that the train length initiative is basically approaching a one-year anniversary, so comps are going to get a little bit tougher, but maybe if you can just recap the last year, some of the accomplishments and what you think is reasonable for in that context for some of the goals looking out through the rest of this year and in to 2017. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure Brian. We over the year of 2015 saw 16% gains in our train length and we\u2019re up to about 6400 feet in total. We saw probably smallest incremental change in the fourth quarter as we had really largely put in place all that we felt comfortably we could in maintaining service to our customers, and we are bumping up against challenges in the single track territory where our siding length is a bit of limited for us. Going forward and in this year we are planning to increase siding length in our core door from Nashville to Cincinnati. That is presently limited to 6500 feet, so we\u2019re making some structural adjustments to help us continue it, and we should see those investments being in place and available to us in the back half of this year. So I would also say that one of the benefits of the initiative that we\u2019ve seen in the ability to flex as seasonality impacts volumes. So in summer months we feel that with a little bit less volume that\u2019s typically out there that we\u2019ll be able to continue to utilize train length and in terms of reducing our cost gives us the ability to (inaudible) where we haven\u2019t before and certainly if anything changes either up or down we\u2019ll be able to adjust accordingly to maintain train length. So we feel really good about the initiative and our team in the field has done a fantastic job putting it in place. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Your line is now open. Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research : Maybe a question for Cindy just following up on the productivity, when you think about the increase from the 200 to the 250, if you could maybe breakdown sort of those specific components a little bit to sort of looking at the puts and takes on some of the expenses. I\u2019m just kind of curious kind of where that comes from, maybe how much weather and maybe how much is headcount, wanted to get a sense there. Cindy Sanborn : As far as going forward, let me try and understand your question, going forward or --. Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research : The incremental between 200 million and 250 million for the target for the full year. Cindy Sanborn : Well I think a lot of it is the initiative that we already have in place. I think the benefit that potentially you\u2019ll hire is to be able to continue to right size and streamline which is also been a big part of our initiative. So we\u2019ve got technology and Michael mentioned in his prepared remarks utilizing that in automation. So it will be some additional benefits to headcount I believe. Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research : And then Fredrik may be a question for you on the market outlook I guess, putting coal aside for a moment it seems like we\u2019re still sort of maybe a bit weaker than seasonally expected at least as far as the outlook for the second quarter. Just want to get a sense the last couple of weeks we\u2019ve seen some challenges intermodal or sort of slip back again. I just want to get a sense of kind of how you feel about where we stand with volumes, the economy just generally outside of some of the specific pressure points like coal. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure. If taken to the highest level from what we see the economy, I think we still see the overall economy progressing in that 2%-2.5% range, kind of uninspiring growth. Clearly we\u2019re still dealing with the aftermath that we saw last year both on the energy side and also the strength of the dollar and the low commodity prices. And as I said earlier that\u2019s going to be with us for at least another two quarters and it is also why we guided to volumes to be down a little bit more year-over-year sequentially in the second quarter. Specifically the last couple of weeks to your question, we look at our four key markets merchandize, intermodal, coal and auto. Our merchandize business has stayed probably some of the two strongest weeks in fact in the last two weeks, but then we have seen some weakness in our coal markets which is consistent with our guidance. We also had some operational issues with some of the terminals we serve in the export side that impacted our volumes. Our auto business was very strong early on in March. We probably had 65% of our cars under load and that\u2019s kind of cycling through that right now. But we continue to see good strength there for the rest of the year, and yes we have seen a little bit of weakness in the intermodal space over the last few weeks, but I don\u2019t think anything that has structurally changed there. So it\u2019s going to be a tough second quarter, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a reflection of where the economy is heading or anything like that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. You may now ask your question. Tom Wadewitz - UBS: Wanted to ask either Michael or Fredrik on pricing. You continue to get very good pricing in merchandize and intermodal, and then the totals a bit less. How do you think that changes? Is that something that you kind of sustain through the full year, and is there a point where if you say rail traffic does - I mean you\u2019re saying it\u2019s going to be weak for a couple of quarters, does the same store price are getting decelerate through the year and its somewhat of a timing impact or would you say, hey look we can just keep doing this and we are kind of immune to softness in track, we\u2019re immune excess rail capacity. So just wondered if you could kind of talk about that, because the numbers are pretty good, they are very good in intermodal and merchandize, but it just seems like there\u2019s a lot of excess capacity out there. Fredrik Eliasson : We\u2019re certainly not immune to what\u2019s going on in the market place and I think you\u2019ve seen a reflection of that here in the quarter versus the fourth quarter as you\u2019ve seen a sequential downtick in our pricing. There obviously are specific drivers of that, we work with our customers on a deal-by-deal basis to understand their needs and what opportunity to drive price is. A critical component of supporting our price right now is of course the fact that our service product has improved significantly. And I think our customers value a long term access to our network and the markets that we provide. Clearly the market is softer now, than it was a year ago, but yet our pricing is frankly up year-over-year as well. So we\u2019re going to work with our customers, our prices are going to reflect what the market allows us to do. At the same time, it\u2019s critical for us to be able to price, so we can reinvest in our business. And there\u2019s been a strategic imperative of ours for a long time, but underlying all that pricing is a service excellent for our customers. Tom Wadewitz - UBS: So that having being said, do you think it\u2019s more likely that you see stability through the year in your same store price or do you think there\u2019s some risk that you see deceleration in that as we look forward. Fredrik Eliasson : We really don\u2019t forecast price. You\u2019ll have an opportunity to see price as we disclose our earnings each and every quarter. But strong pricing is important to what we\u2019re trying to do strategically, and we\u2019re going to work with our customers to make sure that they get service that they need to be successful in their market place and at the same time we need to be able to continue to invest in our business. Tom Wadewitz - UBS: Do you just have a quick thought on where domestic coal inventories are? Fredrik Eliasson : Our domestic inventories are at very high levels, if you look at annuals its well above 100-112 days. I think it\u2019s the latest data that we have and in the south it\u2019s even higher than that about 170 days or so versus kind of the normal range of 55 to 70 days of burn. And so we got plenty of inventory at our customers which will take a fairly significant time I think to get down to more normalized levels. It\u2019s going to depend both and of course where the natural gas prices are, but also dependent on where we see the summer here in terms of how much burn we get as we move towards kind of a peaker and kind of that incremental demand levels. We are more weather dependent than we\u2019ve been in the past to try to work some of these stockpiles down. Operator : Our next question comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Following up on Ken\u2019s question earlier, lot of puts and takes on the labor line. But as I think about total labor and fringe expense in the second quarter, typically we see a decline on a sequential basis. Not sure we think about it being roughly flat versus the first quarter or would you expect it to be a little bit higher. Frank Lonegro : Allison if you look at where we are on an absolute headcount basis what we\u2019ve guided to is sequentially flat which his down about the same percentage on a year-over-year basis that you saw in the first quarter. Clearly the inflation will continue to impact as will the health and welfare peace there. So I\u2019d say flat to up slightly would probably be the right thing to look at. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : And then thinking about the service metrics and in particular train speed, it seems that CSX is lagging the other rails in terms of returning to level seen in 2013. So anything specific driving this, and then when would you expect to get back to peak productivity levels. Fredrik Eliasson : Well Allison, when it comes to services we\u2019re constantly working with Fredrik and his team and making sure we\u2019re providing that service product that our customers need, and we\u2019re really never satisfied with where we are. So the balancing act here is how to trade that off with productivity and inefficiency and make sure they are back to - what Fredrik\u2019s talking about we are earning the ability to reinvest in our business. So I think when I look at it as to where we are? I alluded to you a little bit earlier, we have some opportunities, we\u2019re seeing great performance in our double track territories, it is a little bit more challenging in the single track territory and we are making some investments to improve that and one of the core lots that we have between Nashville and Cincinnati, and we will continue to work on making adjustments as necessary to serve our customers well. Frank Lonegro : And the train length initiative has some impact as well, right. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving the single track challenge. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : Following up with Tom\u2019s question, we\u2019re certainly seeing some really strong pricing across the overall network. If I look last quarter, the delta between the same store sales pricing which obviously includes coal and merchandize and intermodal which kind of strips it out, it expanded last quarter. Can you help us better understand what drove that? Was this kind of unique to the quarter or was there adjustments that were made across the network that are going to impact the duration of the year as well. Fredrik Eliasson : Make sure I understand your question a little bit better Rob. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : If I\u2019m looking at kind of the delta between same store sales at 3.1 and the core merchandize intermodal pricing at 4.0, it\u2019s about 90 basis points. If I look back to the fourth quarter, the split was about 40 basis points. Should I think about, what drove that kind of step up in that split last quarter? Was it something you need because of some closures or just how the volumes were coming on within your coal network or are there underlying adjustments that we should be thinking about having an impact for the duration of the year as well? Fredrik Eliasson : The delta there is pretty much exclusively driven by the fact that we have taken some pretty significant action in our export coal business. That is a reflection of what the market place allows us to do or enforces us to do right now to optimize our bottom line. So that\u2019s really driven export coal more than anything else the fact that that spread has increased. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : Got it. And so inherent in the guidance is export coal volumes coming down. So we should see less of a headwind as I look forward. Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, that\u2019s one way of looking at it. That\u2019s probably one way of looking at it. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : That helps. And also to get a little bit more color in terms of the intermodal RPU, the sequential decline obviously fuel had an impact there. But I would imagine the bigger impact in terms of the first quarter was just the declines, the mix of the business with international being under so much pressure and the uptick in domestic. Was there any impact in terms of [loose] or truck load market impacting intermodal RPU as well or were those two factors the entire explanation of the sequential decline here. Fredrik Eliasson : Most of the impact were because of fuel. We also did see some mix impact in the quarter in both international and in our domestic shorter length of [hall] that impacted as well. But most of our business intermodal space is under long term contract. So while the spot market does effect a portion of the business, most of it is really impacted by longer term trends not these shorter term issues that we\u2019re facing. So while there were some challenges in the quarter, our pricing in intermodal space is still positive. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : I\u2019m not sure if you can help us kind of frame the earnings guidance a little bit better. I don\u2019t if year-over-year is the right way to look at it, but supported earnings were down 18% in the first quarter, are you expecting kind of similar declines in second quarter maybe that\u2019s negative, more negative, and I know that you have some comps on your liquidated (inaudible) so maybe potentially it\u2019s the right way to think about it. I don\u2019t know but if you could help kind of frame that guidance a little bit closer. Frank Lonegro : Scott its Frank. You\u2019re right, we did guide that the second quarter would be down on a year-over-year basis. You\u2019re also right that when you look at the second quarter of last year, it was an all-time record for us in terms of operating income, EPS and operating ratio. So we have a significant comp that we have to work through in the second quarter. We tried to give you as much granular guidance as we could, as we look out over the next three months, certainly we gave you some very specific tonnage guidance around coal and then overall volumes in the mid-to-high single digit range just given the softness in the economy and certainly the coal headwinds play in to that. And we\u2019re going to continue to focus on the things that we have the most impact on certainly safety and service, productivity Cindy mentioned, a run rate of 40 million to 50 million in the second quarter and improving service product as well as continued strong value pricing. So you add all of that up and we come to the conclusion that earnings are going to be down, and if you want to talk sequentially, generally speaking second quarter earnings are better than first quarter earnings, if you look historically at that. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : That\u2019s much tricky if you look at the past couple of years you\u2019ve seen kind of significant increases in earnings first quarter to second quarter. You go back further it\u2019s more smaller increases in earnings and I\u2019m just struggling with the right way to think about the seasonality. Frank Lonegro : Like I said, I think you\u2019ll see a sequential improvement. We had not sized that, but I think you will see a typically seasonal pattern unless of course coal disappoints even further. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : Just one quick follow-up, I think in one of the earlier questions you said that total labor cost should be kind of flattish 1Q to 2Q. So that implies like a 10% increase in comp per employee in the second quarter year-over-year. I just want to make sure that that\u2019s right. Frank Lonegro : I think what I was trying to do is to help Allison see that on a flat headcount number with the inflation that\u2019s fairly typically and a moderating productivity environment that it would be essentially flat to up a little bit. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : In terms of total labor and fringe? Frank Lonegro : Total labor and fringe, that\u2019s right, comp per employee. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Seidl from Cowen and Company. You may now ask your question. Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company : I want to think a little bit longer term here. Could you talk about right sizing the network beyond just furlough and repurposing may be some locomotives. Where are you at in that stage and what really can be done in some of the network that might be just loosing too much traffic for you. Cindy Sanborn : If you\u2019ll indulge me here Jason, I think the changes that we\u2019re making in our company are not short term reactions to temporary economic conditions. So everything is on the table in terms of how we look at our network. I think what you\u2019ve seen us do is rightsizing the coal fields with some specific facility reductions that we\u2019ve made starting in the third quarter last year, which would be Erwin, Tennessee, Corbin, we announced a consolidation of a division from Huntington\u2019s other divisions and also reducing our yard operation and car operation in Russell, Kentucky. On the rest of our network, and we\u2019ll continue to work on the coal network and in the coal fields on making the right decisions, while still serving the customers that we have there. When you look at the rest of the network, we\u2019re focusing very hard on density which is part of our train length initiatives really kind of the underlying component of train length initiative. So as we look at our main arteries, how can we continue to drive density there, which then also allows us to streamline some facilities around that, so you\u2019ve seen us do that with some of the mechanical reductions that we announced that we were going to make in some of our car facility? And then going forward too beyond just simply network type of actions, our technology implementation that allows us to do automate. So we are looking at this as the ability from my perspective to create the plan and execute a plan that helps CSX strive in a rail industry that is fundamentally changing. And so we will continue to drive all of these initiatives and look for ways to tweak them to get even better efficiency while still and I have to say, it\u2019s very important to us that we serve our customers and have a service product that needs or exceeds our expectations. Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company : So what you can do in the coal network down right now or is there more to come in terms of rightsizing that particular PC or network. Cindy Sanborn : I would say we\u2019re never done in any of this, and we\u2019ve taken some really large steps, will continue to look as the demand for our services changes and it will change. We will take the appropriate steps to take out the cost that need to come out. You have also seen us publicly put in to the STB some discontinuance of service on routes where the mines are shut down and we will continue to do those types, take those types of actions that will be aggressive with it. But keeping in mind that it\u2019s a very profitable business for us and we want to serve the customers that need our service. Michael Ward : You may want to mention the change in some of our pricing on the origin side. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure. I mean obviously we work hand-on-hand with Cindy and his team here to help her drive productivity. Not just in the coal fields but elsewhere in terms of train length initiative and so forth. But specifically to Michaels point, we have changed the way we price our coal in the coal field to drive efficiency. So we\u2019ve gone away from pricing zone so to speak rate district towards specific point-to-point pricing that better reflects the reality of operating in to certain brands lines and so forth and the maintenance that has to occur there and we will price more efficient loading points differently going forward which is tough discussions to have with our customers, but at the same time I think this is our understanding that this sort of a transformational change, you need to do something different. So there are a lot of things that we\u2019re doing cooperatively with Cindy to try to help drive out cost, but still protect our service going forward. Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company : My follow-up is on the intermodal side, clearly there is slight capacity in the truckload market place and in fact you could argue it probably got a little more slack here in 1Q. When you talk to your intermodal customers, how are they viewing that? Are they viewing that slack capacity in the trucking market as just a temporary blip where they\u2019re maybe taking manage of it or are they viewing this as longer term they want to play the stock market maybe a little bit more than they have in the past. Fredrik Eliasson : As I said before that we have - a significant portion of our domestic business is under long term contracts. And I think those customers that participate there in those products do value the long term access to our network and the capabilities that we provide. There is certainly right now excess capacity which is reflected in the spot pricing. I would say though that as we look at some of the underlying drivers there especially new orders for trucks which is coming down pretty rapidly, you still have the challenges in terms of driver retention and escalating cost there, and we have the biggest impact that I think all of you followed and we certainly follow as well is the ELDs next year and the impact that that will have definitely as we get in to the second half of 2017. So while this is a soft environment right now that will be with us for a couple of quarters, I think the fundamentals that we talked about for a long time is very much intact. And we\u2019re seeing that in the partnership with the truckers that we continue to build on to allow us to do the long haul and then do the pickup and the delivery which solves some of their strategic challenges. So it is softer, but we do think that\u2019s a temporary issue and that the basic thesis of our intermodal investments and our bullishness of intermodal long term to 9 million loads etcetera is very much intact and frankly the fact that we\u2019re getting still very much positive pricing in intermodal space even in this environment right now, I think bodes well for the long term prospect for an intermodal business. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Hartford of Baird. Your line is now open. Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird: Fredrik may be just taking the other side of the intermodal equation. On the international side obviously there\u2019s a lot of discussion with the implementation of SOLAS in a container weight rules. But any thoughts about how that\u2019s going to look on the other side of 2016 and longer term if and when those rules are implemented. Fredrik Eliasson : We are trying to understand that ourselves frankly, and I think we are learning from our customers. It could be opportunities for people to ship earlier potentially. But at this point, I think it\u2019s a little unclear exactly what the impact will be. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research : My question on efficiency\u2019s been asked, but let me Cindy come back to you in a different way. Gross ton miles are down about 9% to 10%, where are you right now in terms of locomotive capacity, say locomotives online, locomotive on storage. And I\u2019m surprised I\u2019m not seeing more of a reduction in cars online, kind of flat to down 1% over the last year. Can you help explain to me some of these dynamics and what you can and can\u2019t do there? Cindy Sanborn : Sure. I\u2019ll talk about locomotives first. If you compare first quarter \u201915 to this quarter, we actually have about 400 less locomotives active, which is about 10% in line with the volume reductions that you\u2019ve talked about. Within that, embedded in that is the fact that we\u2019ve got 275 store but there\u2019s also another 96 that are lease returns that will be returned in the second and third quarter of this year that we\u2019ve already pulled out. So we feel like we\u2019re fairly, decently in line with the GTM reduction and our workload reduction in our resource take-down as a result of that, and it also allows us if we can surprise on the upside we have the ability to pull more locomotives out. And I would also add that we are receiving locomotives. In our long term purchase plan we have received 26 locomotives of that 100 total in the first quarter. So that\u2019s kind of a puts and takes around locomotives and we are very obviously focused on right-sizing our resources around both locomotives, employees and cars, and I\u2019ll talk about cars here as well. In terms of what you\u2019re seeing with cars online, we have about 1300 cars stores right now, versus - our 13,000 stored right now versus 5500 this time last year. When you look at cars online, the cars that are actually stored don\u2019t come out of the count for a fairly long period of time, about 36 months, it\u2019s a standard that we all have. So if you include those additional cars that were pulled out in the first quarter, we\u2019re down about 4% in terms of cars online. If you take those out with cars online number; so again, we feel like we\u2019re fairly well resourced appropriately for the demand that we have. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Long of Stephens Inc. Your line is now open. Justin Long - Stephens Inc. : I know you aren\u2019t giving specific EPS guidance beyond expectations for a year-over-year decline. But there have been several puts and takes since the January call, and I just wanted to get a sense if your expectation on the magnitude of that EPS decline has changed. When you put it altogether has your overall earnings outlook for this year gotten better, worse or is it about the same as it was three months ago. Frank Lonegro : Hey it\u2019s Frank. I think when you look at the full year, clearly we knew this was going to be a down year, I think in terms of the puts and takes coal has gotten worse on a relative basis versus what we had walked into the year with. We knew we were going to have soft volumes in the merchandize side especially with the dollar and the commodity prices, intermodal is hanging in there especially on the domestic side, and then we\u2019re over delivering on productivity versus how we set out the year, and so if you add all of those up and I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty much in line with what we had originally thought. Justin Long - Stephens Inc.: Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one quick modeling question, I wanted to ask what you\u2019re expecting on the change and incentive comp this year just based on your current plan for 2016. Do you expect a major year-over-year change in incentive comp in the next quarter too? Frank Lonegro : Well obviously that depends on how we do against our internal plans and clearly those are designed to align with the interest of the shareholders. We reset it every year as of January 01, if you remember in 2015 we began to roll-off incentive comp in the third and the fourth quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t suggest any meaningful change in the first and the second quarter and then we\u2019ll update depending on how we\u2019re doing as they year goes on in terms of incentive comp year-over-year as we get out in to the back half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Tyler Brown - Raymond James : Frank, I believe in your 10-K you guys mentioned that on 2016 you guys are expecting to have a 53 week this year. Can you just talk a little bit about what the expected impact in Q4 would be? I mean is it basically adding that extra week of operations and extra week of earnings and then in a similar vein, how would it impact the optics of Q4 traffic? Frank Lonegro : So let us get a little deeper into the year and that\u2019s a good Q3-Q4 question for us. We hit this about six or seven years and its really normalize the number of days in every quarter, the number of weekend days in every quarter, the number of holidays in every quarter and it gives us a better comparable. But one of the things we have historically done and you can expect us to do going forward, we will give you the very specific revenue and expense and operating income and operating ratio of numbers for the 53 week on the fourth quarter call. Tyler Brown - Raymond James : And then Fredrik, I am curious about this new flash move that you\u2019ve noted in minerals. Is this a result of the Coal Ash regulations from last year and do you think this is kind of the tip of the iceberg or do you think this is more of a one-off project. It just seems to me that minerals has been one of the few areas of strength. Frank Lonegro : Now fly ash is a byproduct of burning coal which must be remediated by the utility plants, and obviously it can also be used in the production of concrete. And we do have a significant uptick in interest in looking at opportunities to move this to a variety of land fields business. The first move that we\u2019ve been able to secure and that we do think there are more opportunities as we move forward to capitalize on that input products to get it for our customers to make sense. Operator : Our next question comes from Donald Broughton of Avondale Partners. Your line is now open. Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners : Just real quick, you at least objectively appear to become more and more aggressive in share repurchase in the recent quarters. Refresh on how you think about that? Is it a fixed dollar mark you\u2019re putting towards your purchase and so as stock price falls are you going to buy more or is it some of the metric that\u2019s returning the level through which you\u2019re being aggressive to share re-pricing. Frank Lonegro : No, we\u2019re being very ratable about it as a matter of fact. I mean we have guided previously that it would be about $250 million to $260 million a quarter, so I think all you are seeing is us being the beneficiary of deploying that in a lower stock price environment and so that ratable approach will value more share obviously in a lower price environment and less shares in a higher price environment. So we\u2019re not trying to pick the stock, we are trying to run a good rail road, and so as the price goes down we\u2019ll buy more as the price goes up we\u2019ll buy fewer. Operator : Our last question comes from John Barnes of RBC Capital. Your line is now open. John Barnes - RBC Capital : Going back on Donald\u2019s question, from a share repurchase perspective and it were like due to maybe CapEx that 1Q is a little bit lower. You talked about some of the rationalization of infrastructure and that kind of thing, could you talk about may be the CapEx outlook not just for this year, but going forward should we see it continue to turn lower as whatever the metric is, I guess percentage of revenue is probably not the right measure anymore. But should we expect it to trend lower and if so how do you reallocate may be that free cash flow. Frank Lonegro : Sure. As you know we entered this year and put a plan together on the capital investment side that took out over a $100 million on a year-over-year basis, and that was just reflective of the environment that we\u2019re in. As you\u2019ll look forward I think we have some significant things that will be rolling off, positive trend control would clearly be one of those. And as we look at the asset intensity of our business, there may be some opportunities on the infrastructure on the equipment side. At the same time, as you heard Cindy mention making sure that we can keep pace with the train length opportunities that we have and investing in sidings going forward is going to be important for us, technology investments will also be important for us and making sure we have a good safe and reliable rail road is going to be important for us. So I do you\u2019ll see some moderation overtime as we continue to target 16% to 17% of revenue as our long term goal, and I think we have line of sight to that over the next few years. So, I do think you will continue to see us deploy capital in a balanced view with capital investment being the first priority, second priority being dividends and then the third priority being buyback. So I think you will continue to see us take that balanced approach. John Barnes - RBC Capital : And then Fredrik on the coal outlook, and longer term you got a huge shift in the portfolio makeup of eastern utilities. I guess Southern company just announced another plant site for a nuclear reactor in South Georgia to go along with the two to build a plant (inaudible). I mean you\u2019ve got this incredible amount electricity production coming on line from nuclear. I know you\u2019ve talked a little bit about the plants that are targeted to shut down from \u201916 to \u201918, but is there any concern that as you go out further on that curve that you start to see additional coal facility shut down as a result of maybe some of this nuclear beginning to come online. Fredrik Eliasson : I think we have seen a lot of change over the last couple of years. Who would have thought that in four years we would lose $1.4 billion of coal revenue and we\u2019re pretty much on target here in 2016 to lose at least $500 million of coal revenue. And so clearly based on what natural gas prices are right now, there\u2019s an economic interest in diverting a lot of the utility plants away from coal towards natural gas and in some instance like you pointed out to also to nuclear. We do think though that where we are at these very depressed levels both because of natural gas prices being so low and most likely an unsustainable low place, and the fact that stockpiles are also very, very high that there are opportunities to see some pickup at some point. But there is no doubt that the trend on the utility side is downward going forward. But I don\u2019t think its anywhere close to the pace that we\u2019ve seen here over the last four to five years. So we\u2019re monitoring that very closely, we\u2019re of course also looking at the direct impact of the regulation that is going to kick in here potentially, as we get in to 20-20 and beyond. But I think as we look at the next couple of years, we have seen a significant portion of the pain behind us and right now it\u2019s about seeing where natural gas prices will stabilize and when do we get through this overhang in the stockpiles to get back to more normalized level. When that happens, we\u2019ll see where it is. But the general term is obviously, it\u2019s a downward path. Michael Ward : Bye everyone. Thank you for joining us and we will see you again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. David Baggs : Thank you, Prima, and good morning, everyone and again welcome to CSX Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2016 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we\u2019ll be reviewing this morning along with our expanded quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at CSX.com under the Investor section. In addition, following the presentation, the webcast replay will be available on that same website. This morning, our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Frank Lonegro, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Cindy Sanborn, our Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer will be available during the question-and-answer session. Now, before I turn the presentation over to Michael, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company\u2019s disclosure and the accompanying presentation on Slide Two. The disclosure identifies forward-looking statements, as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. With nearly 30 analysts covering CSX and out of respect for everyone\u2019s time, including our investors, I would ask as a courtesy for you to please limit your inquiries to one question and if necessary, a clarifying question on the same topic. And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation\u2019s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael? Michael Ward : Well thank you David. Good morning everyone. Yesterday CSX reported second quarter earnings per share of $0.47, compared to $0.56 per share in the same period last year. Revenue declined 12% in the quarter; a strong pricing across nearly all markets, was more than offset by the impact of a 9% volume decline, which included a 34% decline in coal, as well as negative mix and lower fuel recovery. Regarding operating performance CSX continued to deliver strong safety performance and service continued to meet and exceed customer expectations and drive further efficiency. In the quarter CSX continued to aggressively and successfully reduce its cost structure throughout the network, recognizing that this company's long term future is built on a fluid and efficient network, serving primarily intermodal and merchandized markets. Despite these cost saving actions, operating income declined a $177 million to $840 million. At the same time, the operating ratio increased 210 basis points year-over-year to 68.9%. Now I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Frank, who will take us through the second quarter results and third quarter outlook in more detail. Frank? Frank Lonegro : Thank you, Michael and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing more detail on our second quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 12% or $360 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decreased 9%, which impacted revenue by about $260 million. In addition, fuel recoveries declined $98 million. We continue to see strong coal pricing from an improving service product, which for the second quarter was up 2.9% overall and 4.0% excluding coal. However this was partially offset by negative business mix in the quarter. Other revenue decreased $29 million, driven mainly by lower incidental charges and coal related revenue from affiliate railroads. Expenses decreased 9% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $96 million in efficiency gains, $86 million in lower volume related cost and $56 million in lower fuel prices. Operating income was $840 million in the second quarter, down 17% versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income was relatively flat to the prior year. And finally income taxes were $262 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. Overall, net earnings were $445 million, down 20% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.47 per share down 16% versus last year. Now let me turn to the market outlook for the third quarter. Looking forward we expect year-over-year volumes to decline in the third quarter, in the mid to high single digit range. Despite some markets growing, the majority of our markets will be down with the most significant declines continuing to be concentrated in coal and crude oil. Automotive is again expected to grow, as light vehicle production remains higher on a year-over-year basis. Minerals volume will be higher with a continued ramp up of the new fly ash remediation business and ongoing strength in construction, which drives demand for aggregates. Agricultural products are expected to decline as the strong dollar and low commodity prices continue to pressure, both domestic and export shipments. Chemicals will be down due to the continued declines in share related products resulting from low crude oil and natural gas prices. We expect crude oil volume to be moderately lower on a sequential basis. Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by an excess supply of natural gas at a price point that favors gas burn over coal in the East. In addition coal inventories remain high and year-over-year volume declines will continue to be significant although less severe than the second quarter due to softer comps in the back half of 2015. Export coal should be moderately lower in the second half of the year from the first half tonnage run rate, consistent with the seasonality we have seen in recent years. Despite modest improvements in the met and thermal benchmarks, the export market will remain pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global over supply. That said, we saw more spot moves than anticipated in the second quarter. As such, we now expect full year export coal tonnage of around 20 million tons. For the total coal market, we continue to expect full year tonnage declines of around 25% with third quarter coal tonnage roughly stable sequentially to what we've seen in the first half of this year or approximately 22 million to 23 million tons in the quarter. Intermodal is expected to be down, as we continue to cycle prior competitive losses in international through the remainder of 2016. Domestic intermodal is anticipated to be roughly flat in light of difficult comps that reflected new business shifting to CSX in the third quarter of last year. Overall our business continues to reflect a market environment driven by low crude oil, natural gas and broader commodity prices as well as continued strength in the U.S. dollar. Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the third quarter. Since last quarter, we've taken aggressive cost action which includes reducing headcount by about 4,500 versus the prior year. As a result, we have achieved about $230 million of efficiency gains in the first half of 2016 and now expect full year productivity savings to approach $350 million. We expect third quarter expense to benefit on a year-over-year basis from our ongoing focus on driving efficiency gains and rightsizing resources. Looking first at labor and fringe, we expect third quarter average headcount to be down slightly on a sequential basis. In addition we expect labor inflation to be around $30 million in the third quarter. Finally we expect a headwind in the third quarter of $25 million to $30 million versus the prior year driven by higher incentive compensation. As a reminder, in 2015 we saw incentive compensation decrease in the second half of the year as market conditions drove CSXs financial results below our initial plan. Looking in MS&O expense, we expect efficiency gains and volume related savings to more than offset inflation. As a result MS&O costs are expected to be down moderately versus the prior year. Fuel expense in the third quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon year-over-year reflecting the current price environment; volume related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect deprecation in the third quarter to increase around $20 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. Finally, equipment and other rents in the third quarter are expected to be relatively flat to the prior year with a benefit of improved car cycle times offsetting higher freight car rates and the increase in volume related cost associated with automotive growth. Now let me wrap up on the next slide. CSXs second quarter results reflect success in a challenging freight environment with macroeconomic and coal headwinds impacting most markets resulting in a 9% volume decline this quarter. This success is driven by pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment, which partially offset those substantial volume headwinds. Looking ahead, let me first provide an update on our 2016 capital investment. Project capital investment has increased $300 million from our initial plan as CSX now anticipates accelerating payments for locomotives delivered throughout 2016 under a long term commitment. We originally intended to pay for these locomotives in 2017. As such 2016 capital investment is now expected to be $2.7 billion. By completing our locomotive purchase commitment this year we simultaneously clear the path in 2017, for CSX to begin returning to our long-term core capital investment guidance of around 16% to 17% of revenue. As we think about market conditions for the remainder of the year, we expect macroeconomic and coal headwinds to continue, low commodity prices and strength in the U.S. dollar will continue to impact many of CSXs merchandised markets, while natural gas prices below $3.50 and elevated stock piles are driving significant headwinds in coal. As a result, we continue to expect total coal tonnage to decline around 25% for the full year. Looking at our expectations for the third quarter and full year, we remain intensively focused on achieving strong pricing that reflects the value of CSXs service product, right sizing resources with lower demand and pursuing structural cost opportunities across the network. As a result of these initiatives we now expect efficiency gains to approach $350 million in 2016. That said the impact of current market conditions on CSX's volume particularly in coal is expected to outweigh our positive momentum. As a result, we continue to expect third quarter and full year 2016 earnings per share to be down from last year. Furthermore as a reminder, third quarter EPS is typically down sequentially from second quarter results reflecting the seasonality of our business. With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks. Michael Ward : Thank you. As Frank discussed, it's clear this continues to be a challenging freight environment with plenty of macroeconomic headwinds. Thanks to the extraordinary work of our employees, CSX is delivering record levels of efficiency and rightsizing resources to the business demand of today. Looking longer term, the company has a bright future as the men and women of CSX are simultaneously positioning the company for growth, where we have the resource flexibility to serve future demand. This will position CSX to maximize long-term opportunities in both our merchandize and intermodal markets. As a result, we continue to be enthusiastic about the core earning power of the company as the market headwinds subside. As we work to transform this company into the CSX of tomorrow, we must grow and make more profitable the merchandize and intermodal markets, which represent our future. At the same time we will continue to preserve the business value of coal, recognizing that it will become a smaller but still important part of our company. Our future evolves leveraging a premier highly efficient network that reaches diverse merchandize and intermodal markets and nearly two thirds of the American consumers. It requires consistent excellent service for customers, which in turn supports efficiency, profitable growth and pricing that allows us to continue investing for the future and includes technology solutions to drive an ever more safe, reliable and efficient railroad. As we manage today's business environment to deliver on the future potential, we continue to focus on achieving a mid 60s operating ratio longer term to deliver compelling value for you, our shareholders. And now, we\u2019re pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Sir your line is now open. Frank Lonegro : Good morning, Rob. Rob Salmon : Hey good morning and thanks for taking the question. Frank, I think on the last call you had indicated that with regard to the earnings cadence, you thought the decline in Q2 would be the largest for the year. As I think out to the back half of the year, with the puts and takes of holding a little bit stronger than what you had anticipated in Q2 cost actions being a little bit more, how should I think about that earnings cadence as I look out? Frank Lonegro : Yes, I think as we look at Q3 earnings on a year-over-year basis, we had mentioned that they will be down. We haven\u2019t sized that as you know. We've got a challenging market environment that I know Fredrik will get into later in the call impacting the top line. There are comps that begin to ease as we get into the back half of the year. Although as we mentioned, volumes in the third quarter will be down mid-to-high single digits, with crude down international intermodal losses in the coal as we mentioned on a year-over-year basis down as well. So we got some negative mix and as moderating productivity as we get throughout the year, obviously we've delivered about 230 million in productivity in the first half and that implies a certainly moderating productivity level as you get into the Q3 and Q4 and then we try to give you some clarity in the third quarter remarks about where incentive comp might be and certainly with fuel prices where they're going and cycling some of the fuel positives that we had in the third quarter of last year, we're going to have a net fuel headwind as well. So we've got some challenges looking ahead of us in the third quarter, but as I\u2019m sure Cindy will mention later in the call, everything is on the table on the productivity side and pricing continues to be favorable given the environment. Rob Salmon : When I think about the mix that feels like it will be little bit less in the third quarter. Fuel is probably going to be little bit tougher. Do those two net out or does fuel overwhelm the mix? Frank Lonegro : Well, let me hit the fuel and then particularly hit the mix one. So when you look at fuel, we had about a $7 million in-quarter challenge in the second quarter. You would anticipate given where the forward curves are, that the in-quarter challenge will likely be a little bit more difficult sequentially and then given the fact that we\u2019re cycling about a $20 million favorable in the third quarter of last year, you're looking at a pretty big obstacle there. Rob Salmon : Got it. Michael Ward : In terms of the mix, I will say that obviously we're going to continue to have the overarching exchange between coal gone away and we're growing intermodal. We have indicated that we do think things will moderate in terms of overall volume decline as we move throughout the year. However, third quarter is still going to be a challenging quarter and frankly, so will fourth quarter, but we do expect things to improve from a volume perspective as we move throughout the second half of the year. Rob Salmon : Appreciate your time guys and I\u2019m sure someone also hit on the efficiencies, but congrats on a good quarter. Michael Ward : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Ravi. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning everyone. So I will hit on the efficiency, so obviously a pretty impressive phase so far this year. I am not surprised that you raised that target of $350 million. This then raised the natural correction as to what innings we're in with the productivity gains here. So just how deep is that well that you can grow from? Cindy Sanborn : Good morning. This is Cindy. I'll respond to that one. I'll tell you when we think about productivity, we\u2019ve generated some in our network performance as you\u2019ve seen our service measurements improve. We think about it structurally and streamlining and process within incentives. So those are the main categories that we look at. When we look at what we\u2019ve done so far, clearly we're lapping some of the big initiatives that we took late in 2015 and earlier this year, but we see -- we have a very long initiative base. We pulled some of those forward, but I think when we look out to the future, I think we\u2019ll continue to drive results both in the back half of the year as Fredrick has -- as Frank has talked about. It will be a little bit less in terms of quarterly numbers, but it's going to be better than what we traditionally do on a quarterly basis. And as I look into 2017, I think we will able to overcome inflation and I think a big part of what is going to help us to do that is our CSX of Tomorrow initiatives around the network as well as automation and technology is going to allow us to continue to drive productivity and I would also want to mention that the actions that we're taking are not reactions. They are actual actions that are driving our decision making relative to our coal portfolio getting much smaller and the importance of providing a safe and reliable service product in the merchandize and intermodal portions of our business. And that is part of our core CSX of Tomorrow strategy and we're executing on that and it well help us to be both service sensitive, more service sensitive company as well as a more efficient company. Ravi Shanker : Got it. So just to clarify, the run rate that you expect to see for the second half of this year, is that a run rate to think of going into '17? Frank Lonegro : Hey, Ravi its, Frank. I think what the numbers would imply in the second half would be about $60 million a quarter. It never works out perfectly as you know, but that\u2019s a general run rate in the second half of the year. As we get closure to the end of the year, we'll be able to give you a little bit more guidance on 2017, but like Cindy mentioned and I'll reiterate, our goal is always to offset inflation with productivity and depending on how those numbers play out as you get into forecasting next year\u2019s inflation numbers, you should see us have confidence in our ability to continue to do that in 2017. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is now open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Ken. Ken Hoexter : Hey, good morning. Just wanted to follow up on Frank\u2019s comment on the increasing CapEx and accelerating locomotives purchasing, just wondering why you're accelerating the CapEx? Did you get better pricing on equipment and does that change your thoughts on cash flow buybacks and use of capital as we move forward? Michael Ward : Hey Ken, honestly it was the avoidance of seller financing charges that we would have incurred if we had stuck with the original deal to pay off the engines next year. So, it\u2019s just a timing over a couple of months. No impact on cash flow. It\u2019s kind of a one-time thing switch between 2017 and 2016. Ken Hoexter : So it\u2019s not a commentary on what you thought on pace of volumes or anything else, just financing to accelerate in a declining volume environment. Michael Ward : Well, we either pay the financing charges or avoid them by pulling it forward and as Cindy is mentioning, every dollar is on the table and that seems like a good way to save a little bit of money as we look forward into 2017. Ken Hoexter : All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is now open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Brandon. Brandon Oglenski : Good morning, everyone. So I want to follow-up on Ken\u2019s question on CapEx. So you talked about the ability in 2017 to get back towards a core investment around 16% to 17% of revenue, but I\u2019m assuming that excludes spending on things like PTCs. So, you might not be willing to tell us right now what you think the non-core items might be in '17, but may be if you could give us some context on what non-core investment has been for the past couple of years? Michael Ward : Sure. So the only thing that we exclude from core investment is positive train control. If you look at what we're doing this year, our all-in number of 2.7 has the $300 million increase for the engines that I just mentioned. It has $300 million for positive train control, which gets you down to the $2.1 billion of core capital that we had started the year talking about and as you might remember, that was a decline of over $100 million in core capital from 2015. You will continue to see us focus hard on core capital and making sure that we\u2019re making the right decisions in terms of infrastructure, equipment and return seeking investments. As you think about PTC going into 2017, that number should decline some from the levels that you see here in 2016 and should step down a little bit and then again between '17 and '18 as we set our sights toward being compliant with the FRAs and Congress\u2019s mandate that would be hardware complete by the end of 2018. And then it should let down even further between '17, excuse me, '18 and '19 and then hopefully all of that will go away as we get to full implementation in 2020 and then you won\u2019t see us carry a positive train control CapEx line after that. It will just become embedded within the broader capital plan. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. I appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open. Frank Lonegro : Good morning, Brian. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey good morning, thanks for taking my question. So if you can just give us an update on the CCX projects. Can you talk about CapEx, what type of CapEx you\u2019re expecting there? Is that something we can do public-private partnership and how close are you to stripping out and finding a site for that investment? Michael Ward : Yes this is Michael, we're really excited about the CCX opportunity. We're finding that we\u2019re getting great cooperation from the state and local officials. We're very encouraged that we will be able to work cooperatively with them. As you mentioned it's a public-private partnership with the State providing back half of the funds. Us providing other half of the funds and we think it's going to be a tremendous economic development opportunity for the State of North Carolina and we're very excited about the progress we're making on it. The exact location hasn\u2019t been finally determined at this point, but we're continuing to make good progress. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Could you just remind me of the timing and the size of the extent it's going to be chasing? Michael Ward : It's going to be roughly $150 million or ours, which is part of the long-term capital plan that Frank evaluated and the State is putting up close to a similar amount for the facility. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Allison. Allison Landry : Good morning, thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the mix during the quarter, in particular it looks like maybe there was some positive mix within the coal segment. So just wanted to see if you could help us understand if that was on the domestic side or export, what drove that and is that something we should expect to persist in the third quarter? Michael Ward : Yes, so Allison on the coal RPU specifically, we did have some positive mix. Obviously we also had the help of fixed variable contract and continued pricing on the domestic side. Offsetting that is of course fuel surcharge revenue coming down and then the actions that we've taken on the export coal market. I do think that it changes quarter-by-quarter, but it is a sustainable level and there will be quarters when it will be up and there will be quarters when it will down. The focus on our part is to make sure that we continue to do core pricing appropriately and then let fuel and mix fall where it was going to fall. Allison Landry : Okay. And were there any contracts on the domestic side that came up for renewal in the second quarter that maybe boosted that a little bit? Michael Ward : Nothing specific that we have about a quarter, 20% to 25% of our contract coming up here by the end of the year, but nothing specifically here in the second quarter that would have changed RPU number. Allison Landry : Okay. Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Your line is now open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Chris. Chris Wetherbee : Good morning, guys. Wanted to follow-up on the CapEx side and just kind of talk a little bit about locomotive spend. So you pulled some forward into 2016, how should we think about the change in locomotive spend as we go into 2017 and 2018? Michael Ward : Sure. So if you take just a year or two view of that and you look at where we are from a locomotive storage perspective, we got about 350 engines in storage and then as you look towards the back half of the year as Cindy gets the deliveries of about 60, 65 of the remaining engines from the purchase commitment that we had started in 2014, I think you should expect in the volume environment that will continue to store engines through that period. As you look forward in the '17 and '18 assuming volumes stay essentially where they are, I doubt you would see us in the market for new locomotives. At the same time we do believe that continuing to reinvest in our four axle, so our yard and switcher engines, is the long-term right thing to do. So you might see a little bit of capital going toward rebuilding the four actual engines, but again no -- probably no big purchases in that time period. Cindy, anything you want to do add to that? Cindy Sanborn : No I would say, as we as we look ahead in the engines that we have stored, the 350 that Frank mentioned are readily able to brought back to service if we need them. In addition to that, we have as we take locomotives out this year, some have gone into recommended retire status, which would not be in our store count. So when you look at GTM is down about 10%, our active fleet is also down about 10% and going forward, I would echo Frank's comments. Chris Wetherbee : So is that the right way to think about it on a GTM basis? I guess it's a tough question because of mix, but when you think about potential volume growth, how much weight and capacity you have on the locomotive side for the next year or two? Is it roughly 10% when you think about it in GTM terms? Cindy Sanborn : When I think about it, GTMs is how we think about our workload demands, but we're obviously cycling a very different type of commodity mix with coal being reduced in lesser GTM intensive business growing hopefully. So we will look at GTMs in terms of workload, but when I think about what's available to bring back it's really and what's in our store status not in the total that we have taken out this year, we're going to recommend to retire some of the locomotives that are -- that we've taken out this year and there's also leases that we've returned to I might add. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. So probably a little less than that number, I guess ultimately is what you're saying. Cindy Sanborn : Less than 10% is what's available to bring back. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much for the time. Operator : Thank you. Then next question comes from Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Tom. Tom Wadewitz : Hey, good morning. Wanted to ask a question I think it's for Frederick it\u2019s on the domestic intermodal side, you guys have done a good job of realizing volume growth despite a difficult market, difficult backdrop in truck. I think you were up 5% in second quarter domestic intermodal, but then you\u2019re saying flat in third. Is that just the kind of impact from that one contract or is there some slowing that you're seeing in the market. I just wondered if you could talk on that domestic intermodal a bit, thanks. Michael Ward : Sure Tom. Really is impact from the fact that last year in the third quarter we had a significant ramp-up in our domestic intermodal business and as we move in here to the third quarter, we're going to start laughing that which is going to make the volume compares a lot more difficult than it's been in the first part of the year and that's really the key driver. The market out there is obviously continues to be challenged with a fair amount of excess capacity. From our perspective though, the intermodal store is broader than that and we continue to have good success in converting traffic off from the highway and partnership with the trucking industry. And we also continue to get some pricing even in this tough environment, which is bodes well for the long term. Tom Wadewitz : Do you have any thought on inventories and whether high inventories are coming down somewhat or is that still an issue this year from shippers? Fredrik Eliasson : Inventory is still at the high level, has been a sequential decline just a little bit, but it's still high versus historical basis. So that\u2019s certainly impacting the international part of our intermodal business more perhaps than it does on the domestic side, which is also why you're seeing the steamship line continuing to struggle quite significant than demand on that side is very week at the moment. Tom Wadewitz : Right. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Kauffman : Hey good morning Mike. Congratulations. Michael Ward : Thank you. Jeff Kauffman : Question for Frank. Frank there's been a lot asked about the CapEx and I understand what you're doing locomotive CapEx, but that is going to create a little bit more of a cash shortfall since it's just really borrowing from '17, do we fund that shortfall with debt and continue repurchasing shares at these levels or do we focus on maintaining cash and maybe slow the repurchase until the cash flow gets a little bigger next year? Frank Lonegro : Hey thanks, Jeff. In terms of the buybacks, you know we're in the midst of the two year $2 billion program that we announced in April of last year you've seen us essentially ratably buy throughout the period about a $1.2 that we\u2019ve repurchased so far throughout that program, about $800 million or so left. I think absent a recession you should see us continue to do that ratably from now through the end of the first quarter of next year and then revaluate where we are from a cash and a ratings perspective as well as with a forward view of earnings might be at that time. Jeff Kauffman : Okay. Thank you. And one detail follow-up, you never mentioned, what are coal inventory days in your northern and southern service regions? Michael Ward : Sure. So right now where we are, we are in the south and we use an external source for this. We're at about 98 days on forward burn in the south and about 71 in the north and just to give you kind of the average benchmark, I think we\u2019ve in the past in the south we expect average to be about 70 and in the north 55. So whether you look at days burn or tons, we're up about 5% year-over-year using that same source. So we\u2019re still at a pretty elevated level as we sit here today. Clearly the warm weather is helping, but it's highly unlikely that by the end of the year we\u2019ll get to normalized level is our best prediction at this point. Jeff Kauffman : Okay. Thank you everyone. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Scott. Scott Group : Hey thanks. Good morning, guys. So wanted to ask one more on the CapEx. If we are not buying locomotives for a few years and PTP spending is starting to come down, it sounds like given volumes that maybe growth CapEx in general should be coming down. I would think that there is an opportunity to cut the CapEx below that historical 16% to 17% of revenue and then you guys can really get a good free cash flow story going which I think would probably help the multiple here. How do you think about that and is that a realistic opportunity? Frank Lonegro : Hey, Scott its Frank. Certainly we\u2019re in our planning process for 2017. It's really too early for us comment on what we think next year's core CapEx is going to be. I think what\u2019s you\u2019re hearing us say is that we're committed to returning to that about 16% to 17% of revenue from a CapEx perspective within that and any given year there is going to be differences between how much is in infrastructure, how much is an equipment, how much is an return seeking investments. And as I think I've mentioned in the conferences back in June, we\u2019re also committed to making sure that the CSXs tomorrow initiatives are part of that capital guidance. So, it\u2019s not something that you\u2019re going to see as take that guidance. Because of the CSXs tomorrow initiative, we're going to take all the right tradeoffs within that framework in order to be able to deliver on the CSX of tomorrow, which is a very important part of our future as Michael mentioned in his remarks. Scott Group : Yeah, I guess I\u2019m just saying if historical that 16% to 17% of revenue historically has included locomotive, so if we\u2019re not buying as many locomotives, I would think that there is an opportunity to get close at historical level or is that realistic or are using not? Michael Ward : I\u2019m not commenting one way or another to be honest Scott. I\u2019m telling that we'll give you some guidance on 2017 as we get closer to the end of the year and then as we begin to talk about the CSXs of tomorrow and the associated financial parameters of that, we'll give you some guidance longer term. Scott Group : Okay. And then if I can just ask one more just kind of detailed question. Just on coal, can you give us the mix of your coal by basin App coal, Illinois and PRB and where do you see the switching points? Fredrik Eliasson : Sure so, here in the second quarter, we saw an increase in our basin coal off to about 37% of our overall utility portfolio and really that\u2019s what's relevant I think just looking at the utility portfolio. So 37% thereabout for Illinois, PRB about 20%. So we had about 57% of our coal was at Illinois basin or part of the basin and the rest was Appalachia and that is up little bit from what we saw in the first quarter and frankly we expect Illinois Basin to continue to do well longer term as part of our utility mix. Michael Ward : Thank you, Scott. Scott Group : Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jason Seidl of Cowen. Your line is now open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Jason. Jason Seidl : Good morning, Michael. Good morning, team. I wanted to focus a little bit on the mineral line, obviously the new fly ash contract is ramping up and that\u2019s distorting the yields a little bit here. How should we look at yields going forward for the remainder of the year as the contract ramps up. Michael Ward : Are you talking about yields overall or specifically in minerals? Jason Seidl : Specifically in minerals. Michael Ward : I think overall it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a much different picture in terms of the yields. Clearly the fly ash is a big initiative on our side. We're also seeing strength in other parts of our minerals business, but I don\u2019t think you -- that that RPU is significantly different than any other part of our minerals business. So I think those drivers are similar within the other parts of that portfolio as well. Jason Seidl : Okay. And just a follow-up question on coal, you guys talked about being 98 days in the South, 71 days in the North, how should we think about earning that through? If we get a normalized summer and a normal winter, at what point are we going to get back to those levels you talked about 70 in the South and 55 in the North? Michael Ward : Well most of the external sources we use and all the discussions with utilities would indicate on average that we'll get there sometime in 2017 hopefully in the first half of 2017. Clearly as I said earlier, this summer is helping. Clearly there are utilities that are below where they want to be and frankly we have seen additional calls here over the last month or so and that\u2019s a pretty low bar because the phone certainly wasn\u2019t ringing and for several months. But it is helping, but you have some of our utilities that we serve have an awful lot of coal on the ground at this point and it\u2019s going to take more than just really hot summer to get it back to where it needs on average. Jason Seidl : And so as we think about coal for next year, I\u2019m assuming we should think at least the first half should be still continued to be pressured? Fredrik Eliasson : I think that there is a high likelihood of that. As I said, we will have a much better feel for that as we get through here the summer to see where we end up usually not just in coal, but in all of our markets we go out and really work closely with our customers to get a sense of what the plan for '17 should look like. And at that point as we get into third quarter definitely the fourth quarter is initially is we have a much better sense of what we are, but overall I think it\u2019s important to say two things. One what is happening here right now in coal in terms of the hot weather and the fact that natural gas prices have recovered a little bit, is really more of an impact for '17 than it is short term in '16. And then I think it\u2019s also important and we\u2019re probably the most vocal on this, from our perspective right now, we're planning for a secular decline in our coal business, we would love to be wrong about that, but in terms of how we approached our business and how we approach our planning, we continue to see a secular decline. Doesn\u2019t mean that you can have a year or so where it goes up, but overall we think that the trend is pretty clear where it's heading. Jason Seidl : Fredrik that\u2019s fantastic color. Listen Fredrik, Michael, team I appreciate the time as always. Michael Ward : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Ben. Ben Hartford : Hey, good morning, guys. Cindy just some perspective on current service levels, pick your measure whether it's real time or velocity, are those measures have somewhat stagnated over the past few quarters still above 2013's peak level. Any thought or hope of being able to return those measures back to 2013 levels or should we for the time being kind of ignore what you\u2019re able to do in '13 and look for improvement, but the likelihood of returning those levels, I would be interested in any perspective there? Cindy Sanborn : Great, well Ben we've improved our service levels both sequentially and year-over-year as you can see from the charts. We were actually a little ahead of where we have planned to be for this year and obviously improved network performance does provide some efficiency gains for us and we are committed to provide a service product that meets or exceeds our customer's expectations, helps for price for the value of the service that we provide. We have to balance that always with some efficiency initiatives and I think we\u2019re doing that. I think we're pretty happy with where we are, where there is always opportunity to improve and we will do that. I think I have also highlighted before and you've probably heard Frank talk about it before where we have installed our train link initiatives that is more problematic for us in terms of the velocity let's say is on the southern part of our network, which is mostly single track. So we think that's the right mix. We've made the right decision there. We're seeing over time down, re-cruise down and other measures that give us confidence that we're improving, but it's I think we're pleased with where we are and we will work to improve and Frank\u2026 Frank Lonegro : Yeah, let me just speak from a sales and marketing perspective. I would say that the efforts here this year has been to really focus on the most service sensitive part of our business specifically intermodal businesses to drive that service up and that's where we made those gains and it is markedly different and it's really helping our pricing efforts. Also one of the key things for us is to reduce the spend around the mean and that is also improving significantly because there's also as we look at a broader portfolio it is about being able to be there each and every day at a reliable way. Our local service has improved significantly as well and really as we look at the customer facing measurements, not so much the measurements that you're seeing in terms of what we disclosed certainly has improved significant as well. So from our perspective, I think we're making the right tradeoffs between productivity and service and as Cindy said on the productivity side, we\u2019ve never done and the same thing holds true on the service side. We always want to do better for our customers and I think we're seeing that cooperation from operations and we feel very good about where we are. Ben Hartford : Okay. That makes sense. So from the metrics that we can see, that 2013 high watermark, are those targets that are credible, do you feel like that you can get back those levels over time and potentially exceed them? Cindy Sanborn : I think everything is on the table, in terms of the pace and cadence at which we may get there, it's probably a longer term type of aspiration. But again there's nothing that we're satisfied with. I'm not satisfied with the service measurements nor the efficiencies and we will continue to work on both, but I think that's a longer term initiative. Ben Hartford : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities. Your line is now open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Cherilyn. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. I wanted to ask a question on productivity, which I think was a highlight again this quarter and you always do a very good job of disclosing productivity versus the volume related cost reduction. I just wondered if you could talk about the rigor with which you track that internally and make sure that you're holding people accountable. Frank Lonegro : Hi Cherilyn it\u2019s Frank and absolutely we have a lot of rigor within finance organization, which in some respects is the score keeper here. What we do in terms of tracking productivity, we make sure that we normalize for volume first. So to the extent that there are volume variable expenses then those don't count for productivity and what you've seen this year is that in the first half for about $150 million of what we call right sizing or volume variable cost reductions and then $230 million of structural cost efficiencies, there is a lot of accountability around productivity and again that is the way that we take costs out long term. Let me give you just a simplistic example that may help illustrate it so that coal, just because coal volume have come down, so if a coal train ran last year, but doesn't run this year then the cost associated with locomotives and crews and fuel and car costs would come out of volume variable expenses and so you would hear us talk about those in terms of right sizing. Yes, for example and we have instances of this where you have two coal trains than ran last year and this year through the train length initiative and network routing we've actually put those two trains together and run in 200 car trains to 100 car trains, the efficiencies associated with less locomotive intensity crew intensity, fuel intensity etcetera would be allocated toward productivity. Cherilyn Radbourne : Great, that's helpful. Thank you. That\u2019s all for me. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Vernon of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Michael Ward : Good morning, David. David Vernon : Great, thanks for taking the question. Frank, this is kind of a great set up to what I wanted to ask you in terms of the size of the absolute productivity number. As we've gone through the year, it does seem like that number is growing at the same time that our expectations for forward volume are getting worse. Is it right to believe that you guys are finding more opportunities to drive that productivity because there's less traffic on the network and then that productivity pool is kind of expanding in relation to the volume decline, that\u2019s kind of the first question I wanted to ask you. Michael Ward : I think what you'll see us do in a environmental like this where we realized that the revenue portfolio is in transition and the volume especially on the coal sides coming down as we turn over every rock, and you heard Cindy talk a lot about all the things that she is doing on the operating side, and not to the exclusion of the G&A side. The G&A side every department is also looking for ways, the challenge every cost dollar. So, I think what you are seeing is really an across the board focus in our company to be disciplined on cost. We've always been disciplined on cost. We\u2019ve always tried to offset inflation with productivity but just given where we know the business is going we\u2019re really looking at the structural things in a way to reduce the overall cost intensity of the business. And when volumes inflect positively obviously, we will be able to grow with that both on the earnings and the margin side and to the extent the growth comes in, you know the batch merchandized business or the intermodal business or the automotive business, you should see us grow with - of the incremental margin. So, I think what you are seeing is the company focused on cost given the environment. David Vernon : I guess the second part of the question is as you are taking that in your example the two 100 car trains and making a 200 car train, I guess when volume does inflect how do you think the cost structure will react? Do you think that the variable cost might go up and you should probably just shouldn't care because the contribution is so high? Or do you think you can actually sustain this lower level of variable unit cost that you've been able to engineer given the extra space on the network? Michael Ward : Sure, it depends in large part on how the volumes come back and where the volumes come back. We have engineered a lot of flexibility into the network through the train life in variable scheduling initiatives that you heard us talk about. Again as I mentioned, if volumes come back in class traffic and part of the scheduled network, you should see us be able to grow volumes without adding back variable costs. If the volumes come back in both traffic, where you're adding a new train start for a new bulk train, then you should see us bring that back but again that - the resource is back but again that would be a nice margin so, you would want us to do that. David Vernon : That's kind of what it seems like. Well, those are my two. Thanks very much for the time. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John Larkin of Stifel. Your line is now open. John Larkin : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to see how much granularity on the accelerated productivity targets you are willing to share with us. There are a lot of initiatives obviously underway, coal network rationalization, longer trains, closing down some excess facilities, eliminating duplicate overhead, all of those are very admirable initiatives. Are there any two or three of those that have really been the primary reason why you've almost achieved your entire former productivity target in the first six months that had originally been established for the entire year? Cindy Sanborn : John, I think some of the \u2013 what we've been able to do is put a serious of initiatives together mostly structural with the closure of facilities like late year in the coal network and moving forward into this year where we also closed Russell Yard, and also consolidated our Huntington division headquarters. But it's not just in the coal space. We\u2019ve also announced publically and probably right it where we\u2019ve consolidated facilities and set in Central Florida with Winston Yard in Tampa, a consolidation actually in Tampa and also streamlining on mechanical facilities and shops that are aligned more with our outer triangle in the core network that we have. Our job is to really become less resource intensive so between train length and so the density of the train, as well as the density of the - the route that we route the train has also allowed us significant savings across the board. So I think there is really no one thing, I think that we\u2019ve accelerated that \u2013 we\u2019ve really answered your question but we are able - as we\u2019re able to put initiatives in places we are doing so and continuously looking for more. We have great momentum here, everyone is over delivering and I think, technologies are big help for us and also some of are working with the labor organization is also a big help for us. John Larkin : Thank you for that very detailed answer. And then maybe has a follow-on, I understand there's a fairly big initiative internally given that intermodal is going to be a bigger part of the puzzle going forward to make intermodal more consistently profitable going forward. And it occurs to me that some of the initiatives to achieve that goal come from the marketing side. And I was wondering if Fredrik could talk about some of the initiatives that perhaps sales and marketing has underway within intermodal to normalize the volume so that you are running full trains every day of the week every week of the year. That's an obviously very difficult mountain to climb, but can you talk a little bit about what you are doing there perhaps in working with third parties to fill all the trains up every day to really leverage that productivity? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, there is a variety of things there that we all working on there, that's absolutely right John and some of them are - I think at this point ready for public consumption, some of them are not but overall you're absolutely right, in an environment where the RPU is so much lower, one of the key things that you can do to drive up margins is to make sure that you have a much more leveled workload and the team is certainly working on that and thinking through how we can do that longer term that is a pretty significant structural change. In the meantime what we are doing do is work on terminal productivity. We have a variety of initiatives in place there that has deal that are lot of results here. We continue to work on train lengths in our intermodal space to make sure just as we do elsewhere in our business to allow for the leverage that occurs there. Of course double stack clearance is important and you know we already - we didn't have any tunnel by the end of this year, we should be able to be double stack clear there as well. And then the hub and spoke strategy that we have lined out for all of you for a long time has allowed for a significant amount of efficiency being able to penetrate some of these smaller markets with the lot more density that we otherwise could and of course overall speed of the network itself which I alluded to before which has been a priority as we think about the service improvement there in 2016 because the turn time on the equipment is critical. And then to your point and then there is little more longer-term, how do you structurally ensure that the day or the weak balancing as a little bit better than what it is today but that is I think a little bit longer term initiative from our perspective. John Larkin : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Bascome Majors : Good morning. We talk a lot about rising competition and its impact on intermodal but I wanted to focus on how it's hit your carload merchandise business. Do you have a sense of how much share loss to truck has been a drag on overall volumes and I guess, more importantly, when you begin to cycle the worse of that drug on what's called a year-over-year basis? Michael Ward : You know one of the key things that we are focused on right now within our sales and marketing team is to sell through this cycle of excess capacity and there is excess capacity in the truck market and that is probably impacting our volume to some degree but one of the key things for us is to continue to be able to reinvest in our business and not necessarily chase that down too much, when we see these temporary changes because we do have to be able to be there for our customers day-in and day-out and that is one of the things that we sell with our customers that we got to work through the downturn that we\u2019re seeing right now and we want to be able to be there for you not just today but also tomorrow when capacity is tighter. So we are seeing in certain other markets beyond intermodal where there has been probably some share loss to truck. We look at that each and every deal as the marketplace and we always try to estimate what the second best alternative is and try to match that. And in certain places where that is below what we think is long-term re-investible for us at that point we probably don't participate because we don\u2019t want to do anything unofficially. The pricing level is critical with the service improvements that we have gotten here we have been able to sustain and allow customers to see the long-term value that access to our network provides but in certain places if we have seen some traffic or way back to truck. Bascome Majors : Understood. And I just had a quick housekeeping one on one of your expense guidance items. On MS&O, it implies what you guided that it could be up as much as 10% sequentially from the second quarter in 3Q. Looking back it's been eight or nine years since we've seen a magnitude of that rise from Q2 to 3Q. Can you just give us a little color on what's driving that expectation, that big increase? Frank Lonegro : Yes Bascome, it's Frank. I\u2019m not commenting on the numbers that you threw out there. As you know MS&O is awfully difficult to predict in any given year and in any given quarter I think what we said was it will be down moderately versus the prior year which does has some implications sequentially. I think what you\u2019re going to see is we had the timing item on the $10 million casualty reserves, so that's generally what we do in the second quarter, in the fourth quarter of each year we relook at the probability and severity of casualty. And we had a favorable one time item you shouldn't think about that on a sequential basis in the third quarter and then in any given quarter again you have timing items and small onetime items that are going to impact the sequential comparisons. So I think you're directionally accurate although again not commenting on your numbers specifically. Bascome Majors : Thank you for the time this morning. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Justin Long of Stephens. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Justin Long : Thanks, good morning. So I wanted to start by asking about the point to point pricing initiative in coal. Could you provide an update on how far along you are in that process, and do you think this will be a tailwind or a headwind to the core price numbers you're putting out today? Fredrik Eliasson : So we have implemented the point to point pricing across our coal network. And overall I would say that process has gone very well. The reason for doing that is to make sure we better match to true cost of service some of the locations that are further away from so called our core routes to reflect a maintenance cost and operating cost that is associated with moving that. I don't think that that will be material in any way shape perform to our same store sales measure. That is really is more about ensuring that as we try to rationalize the infrastructure in the coalfields, that we from the sales and marketing perspective help operations to do that by truly reflecting what it cost to move some coal from sort of the mines that are further away from some of our core routes. That's really all it's about is not, so much about the same store sales changing because of it. Even though I think overall I would say probably it's slightly helpful. Michael Ward : So Fred did you put in place on the tariffs that will take some time to go through all the contracts. Fredrik Eliasson : That is correct as well. We've put it in place in terms of the tariffs, we adjusted one or two contracts, but it will probably take one or two or three years frankly to get it completely implemented across our whole book of business. Q \u2013 Justin Long : Got it. That's helpful and maybe as a quick follow-up, so the 4% increase in core price excluding coal is a pretty strong number in this environment. It's also above what we've seen from some of the other rails here to date. Do you think this level of price increases is sustainable as we get into the back half of the year or is there risk we see some moderation given truckload capacity is pretty loose right now? Fredrik Eliasson : Well. So first of all a great testament to both what our sales and marketing team has done in this tough environment to your point about the strong results and also clearly a critical part of this has been the service improvements that we have seen. We don't really forecast what pricing will do over time. We will obviously disclose it each and every quarter in terms of our quarterly flash, but I think you know from my statements before on hand we know value accretion for CSX pricing is a critical component of that. But I've also alluded to the fact that I think short term meaning for the next 12 months or so we see a period of excess capacity out there that certainly is impacting things but overall you have a chance to see it where it comes each and every quarter. Justin Long : Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thanks so much for the time. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Donald Broughton of Avondale Partners. Your line is now open. Donald Broughton : Good morning. Thank you for taking this call or the questions gentlemen. Help me think about this strategically or help me understand how you think. I understand how the strength of the U.S. dollar is affecting, negatively affecting ag exports and exports of other commodities. I understand why crude being under 70 is affecting negatively chemical volume and everything related to fracking and nat gas obviously under 4 is going to continue to be a headwind for coal. So what's your crystal ball? Not that your crystal ball is any better than anyone else's but you have to have a plan, what do you plan? Do you expect the dollar to stay strong, crude to stay above under 70 and nat gas to stay under 4 for the foreseeable future? Is that your expectation or are you planning for the dollar to get weaker, for crude to go back up and nat gas to go back up? Frank Lonegro : That's where the flexibility I think in our resource planning is critical because to your point earlier, there is a lot of crystal balls out there but I\u2019m not sure which crystal ball is better than the other, what we do as I said earlier, we do go out to our customers in the fall to tried to get a sense of what they're seeing in the different markets that we serve and then from there, we take their best input and triangulate with other things to put together our perspective on 2017. And it is a very volatile marketplace right now where it's very hard to predict. We have laid out that overall from a coal perspective. We do think that there is a secular decline that we're heading towards and certainly we\u2019ve seen the vast majority of that already. The U.S dollar it is impossible for me to sit here and predict with U.S dollar is probably much better than look at forward curve than me speculating on that but the key thing for us is that we continue to have flexibility in our resource planning and right now the best predictor of tomorrow's today, the dollar is strong and the locomotive prices are there so that\u2019s kind of how we approach there. Michael Ward : Donald, what does your crystal ball say? Donald Broughton : My crystal ball says is that crude is going to stay under 70 and nat gas is going to stay under 4 for the foreseeable future and that there's nothing to indicate that the dollar is going to get weaker anytime soon. But, again, whose crystal ball is better than the other? I just wondered what you are planning against. What is your best guess? Because obviously I understand you're triangulating your expectations to your customers but you have to have your own internal gauge as to where you are going, as well. Fredrik Eliasson : And I think that goes back to the point of flexibility. It is so hard to plan these days but I think Cindy and team has done a fabulous job of really variablizing in our cost structure. We talked about that for a long time and then we do whatever we can to forecast even on a monthly basis and try to flow their around the network so we can make very timely changes to a network based on the best information we had but it's hard to see much beyond a month or three month at this point. Donald Broughton : Very good, very fair. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John Barnes of RBC Capital. Your line is now open. John Barnes : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two things. One, you indicated that you saw more spot-load activity on coal volumes in the quarter. Fredrik, I think you alluded to a few more phone calls. Do you have a sense for how much volume moved in the quarter, was it on a spot basis versus on a normal contractual basis? Fredrik Eliasson : On the export side? John Barnes : Overall\u2026 Fredrik Eliasson : Overall, and as you well know in export side pretty much everything is spot these days. So also that to the great example of the previous question around the - things change very fast in terms of how much we move and then we did see a pick up on the export side in the second quarter beyond what we had originally anticipated which is why we increased the guidance on the export side to about $20 million tons for the year. On a domestic side really the cost that we received is really come in here over the last - I would say three to four weeks and really we haven\u2019t had a chance to move a lot of that yet but we do expect a little bit of a sequential uptick on a domestic coal which is embedded in the guidance as we expect, export coal to be weaker in the second half, we expect the domestic coal to be slightly stronger within that $22 million to $23 million to 22 to 23 million tons for the quarter. John Barnes : Okay, all right. And then my second question, and this is a little bit longer term more strategic in nature. I recognize both of these things have only occurred since July 1, but you have got be expanded Panama Canal is now open, the bookings are pretty solid thus far and then you had the SOLAS rules go into effect on July 1, as well. Have you seen any impact of either and what do you think are the longer-term impacts? What do you think it means? Is there a stairstep in volume as a result of one or both or is this just moving, this is just changing where the freight, how the freight gets to you but no real stairstep? Fredrik Eliasson : On the SOLAS, first of all we really haven\u2019t seen any impact at all. We\u2019ve spoken to our international customers and it seems likes the capabilities have been there either by the port or some of the other type orders or somebody else providing that information as required. So we have not heard anything or and we don\u2019t anticipate any impact on our international volumes because of SOLAS. In terms of Panama Canal obviously it is very recent, as little too early to tell, we have said this for a while that there is so many different drivers that comes into play here, that is very difficult to predict exactly what\u2019s going to happen. The good news is that we have a flexible network. We will be able to handle additional volume coming into the East Coast. If that happens and we\u2019re working very closely both with international customers and with the ports to make sure we have the capability that we need if it is a bigger shift that we\u2019re currently anticipating. John Barnes : Very good. On the ports, how far behind are the ports of being prepared for this? Michael Ward : I don\u2019t think that is my place to comment John. I think overall we work very well with the ports. Certain of the ports have better infrastructures than others of course, but overall it\u2019s a great relationship and I think the East Coast ports are certainly seeing this as an opportunity and have spent a fair amount of capital the last decade to prepare for this so. John Barnes : Okay. All right, thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Your line is now open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Keith. Keith Schoonmaker : Good morning, Michael and this is probably a question for Fredrik related to your last answer, could you comment on the possibility that significant potential Panama Canal diversions from the historical land bridge road could be simply truckable when they arrive by ship? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, so our view of this has been is that as you -- if you do see a major shift over to the East Coast ports, we might lose some traffic that goes into the coastal regions that will be trucked to those markets. However, we also see then the opportunity to pick up some traffic into the Ohio Valley into more kind of the Southeast that is further away from the ports including potentially also going all the way back up to Chicago and we\u2019ve seen a fair amount of shift already as the Suez Canal has taken up a bigger shift. We have seen as production in Asia has moved to more to the Southeast that we've seen additional volume coming into the ports. So we have the capability, but and it could be a little bit of a mixed change but overall we feel that we\u2019re very well positioned to capture whatever happens. Keith Schoonmaker : Okay. Thanks. Maybe just one more on truck competition. In the commentary I think that was issued last night, if I am remembering correctly, there was a remark about forest products experiencing some competition from trucking and yet you managed to grow domestic intermodal an impressive 5%. It's sort of a contrast there, losing in one area. Is this just pretty route specific with the forestry? Fredrik Eliasson : Well and the reason why the intermodal domestic has been as strong as it's been has been the fact that we on-boarded significant amount of new traffic from one specific customer last fall and we\u2019re starting to lap the peers as we get to the third quarter, hence the guidance for not the same sort of growth and probably close to flat on the domestic side as we get to the third quarter. And obviously long-term we think we can grow the domestic intermodal business kind of about 5% to 10%, but we are in a period here on the domestic side and on some of the merchandize side where we see some temporary weakness because of excess capacity, but we fully expect that to be worked out over time and allow us to get back to more normalized growth rate as we move into hopefully the second half of '17 or so. Keith Schoonmaker : Okay. Great. Thank you, Fredrik. Operator : Thank you. The last question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Sir your line is now open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Scott. Scott Schneeberger : Hey good morning. Thanks. I was going to ask on a couple smaller segments since we are at the end here. But with regard to metals, could you give us an update on what you are seeing there, in particular the steel? And is there a chance that it could swim to positive volume growth within a matter of quarters? Michael Ward : I think steel production year-to-date is relatively flat year-over-year and part of what has helped that has been that the countervailing peers and so forth has been very helpful to stem the flow of imports into the United States. Our volumes are down a little bit more than that and the reason for that is on one hand no closures that has affected us specifically. We have one mill that we both have inbound and outbound too that has closed down. That is really a big driver for our volume decline and we also are seeing the impact in the metal side from little bit more truck competition that we\u2019ve seen before. And so as we think about the second half, I think it's little too early. I think we're going to have some of these specific -- specific CSX related issues that is going to hurt us as we get into the second half of the year. So I think the second half will be pretty challenging still, but the key thing for us is to continue to work with our customers on the deal side, provide a better service product and continue to make sure we can reinvest in the business and that's what we're focusing on. Scott Schneeberger : Great, thanks. And just as a follow-up, and again a small segment, but waste and equipment, a nice lift from revenue per unit in the quarter. Is that something that's going to persist or was that a one-time event? Frank Lonegro : There's a lot of changes depending on what you move in that, because a lot of that equipment are some high winds that have very high revenue per unit, because it's a very specific service, specific unit train and so that varies quite a lot from quarter-to-quarter, but overall positive pricing continues but we\u2019ll probably see more volatility in that line item than any of the other line items. Scott Schneeberger : Okay. Thanks again and congratulations. Michael Ward : Thank you. And thank everyone for joining us and we will talk to you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. You may disconnect your lines.",

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. David Baggs : Thank you, Sherlyn, and good morning, everyone and again welcome to CSX Corporation\u2019s third quarter 2016 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we\u2019ll reviewing this morning along with our expanded quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at CSX.com under the Investor section. In addition, following the presentation, the webcast replay will be available on that same website. This morning, our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Frank Lonegro, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Cindy Sanborn, our Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer will be available during the question-and-answer session. Now, before I turn the presentation over to Michael, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company\u2019s disclosure and the accompanying presentation on slide two. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements, as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. With nearly 30 analysts covering CSX and out of respect for everyone\u2019s time, including our investors, I would ask as a courtesy for you to limit your questions to one primary question and one follow-up question. And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation\u2019s Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael? Michael Ward : Thank you, David. Good morning everyone. Yesterday CSX reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.48, compared to $0.52 per share in the same period last year. Revenue declined 8% in the quarter, consistent with an overall volume decline of 8% which included a 21% decline in coal volume. Turning to operations, safety performance remained strong and service levels continue to meet or exceed customer expectations driving further network efficiency improvements. In addition, CSX further reduced structural cost in the quarter and aligned resources levels to lower volume while retaining the ability to flex those resources with demand. Continuing to match resources to demand, combined with our ongoing initiatives to support network fluidity forming the foundation to maximize future merchandise and intermodal growth opportunities. As significant cost savings partially offset the impact of lower volume and the changing business mix, operating income declined $92 million year-over-year to $841 million. At the same time the operating ratio increased 70 basis points year-over-year to 69.0%. Before I hand the presentation over to Frank, let me thank our employees, customer and suppliers for their skillful planning and tireless efforts working together to manage the effects of Hurricane Matthew over the weekend and through this week. Times like this remind us of the paramount importance of safety for our employees, customers and the communities we serve, as well as the critical importance of the service we provide for American businesses. Now I'll turn the presentation over to Frank who will take us through the third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook in more detail, Frank? Frank Lonegro : Thank you, Michael and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing more detail on our third quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 8% or $229 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decreased 8%, which impacted revenue by about $220 million. In addition, fuel recoveries declined $63 million in the quarter, but was offset by strong coal pricing from an improved service product. Same store sales pricing for the third quarter was up 2.3% overall and 3.6% excluding coal. Other revenue decreased $9 million driven mainly by lower incidental charges versus the prior year. Expenses decreased to 7% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $112 million in efficiency gains and $53 million in lower volume related cost. Operating income was $841 million in the third quarter, down 10% from last year. Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income increased $11 million. And finally, income taxes were $260 million in the quarter, with an effective tax rate of about 36%. Overall net earnings were $455 million, down 10% versus the prior year and EPS was $0.48 per share, down 8% versus last year. Now let me turn to the market outlook for the fourth quarter. Looking forward you will notice that the outlook reflects our adjusted market alignments. As released in our third quarter earnings, we are now referring to our markets as shown on this slide, which is consistent with how we are managing the business. The previous food and consumer market is now part of agricultural and food products, waste in the fly ash business have moved to chemicals and the equipment business now resides in the renamed metals and equipment market. Reclass volume, revenue and RPU information for the last three years are available on our Investor Relations webpage. In 2016, CSX's fiscal calendar includes a 53rd week. And as such we will be reporting a 14 week fourth quarter. When taking the full quarter into account with an extra week versus the same period last year, we expect volume to be roughly flat. However, on a 13-week comparable quarter basis, we continue to see a soft but stabilizing industrial economy with volume down year-over-year. In addition to the standard view we provide each quarter, which on the slide shows expectations for the 13 week comparable period, we have included a red, yellow, green designation to the far right, which shows the full quarter impact of the extra week on volume expectations. That said the market comments to follow reflect expectations on a 13 week comparable basis. Automotive is again expected to grow as light vehicle production remained strong and new business continues to ramp up. Agricultural and food products is expected to be neutral, the record grain harvest will drive year-over-year gains. However market dynamics for ethanol remained challenged near-term for CSX due to increased movements in storage in the Gulf region. Export coal is also neutral as we are seeing some near-term increase in meteorological demand, driven by reduced Chinese supply such that volume should be similar to last year's levels. We expect our full year export coal tonnage to be around 25 million tons. Chemicals will be down with continued weakness in drilling related products, especially crude oil due to low crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads. This impact more than offsets growth in core chemicals and the continued ramp up of new fly ash business. Domestic coal will again be down however, in the fourth quarter we will cycle the start of the pronounced market weakness, which took hold in the fourth quarter last year. While the excess supply of natural gas continues to provide a price point that favors gas burn over coal, the easier comparables will moderate the rate of decline we have seen over the last several quarters. We expect domestic coal tonnage to be relatively stable to what we saw in the third quarter. Intermodal will decline as we continue to cycle comparative losses in international in the fourth quarter. Additionally as we previously reported, we will continue to cycle some short-haul traffic loss in the domestic market, which began in the third quarter. Absent to this we continue to experience strength in the domestic segment driven by our strategic network investments that support highway-to-rail conversions. Minerals will be down in the quarter as we cycle a strong period last year that benefited from an extended aggregate shipping season in the north due to mild weather late into the year. Overall on a comparable 13 week basis, we expect volume to be down mid-single digits. Low crude oil, natural gas and other commodity prices, as well as strength in the U.S. dollar continue to challenge the rail marketplace. Although the impact of these factors is beginning to moderate as we move through a full year of this external climate. When we report earnings in the fourth quarter our GAAP numbers will include the full 14 weeks of volume in revenue. Again a preview of 14 week volume expectations has reflected to the far right of the slide, which in total represents about flat volume year-over-year. When we report next quarter, we will provide a breakout of volume and revenue for the final week of fiscal year, which is a holiday week to facilitate year-over-year comparisons. Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the fourth quarter. As a result of aggressive cost actions we have achieved over $340 million of efficiency gains year-to-date and now expect full year productivity savings to be about $400 million. Looking at the fourth quarter, the drivers for each expense category are shown on a comparable 13 week bases versus the prior year. Separately at the bottom of the slide we have provided guidance for the incremental cost associate with the 53rd week this year. In addition, we will be cycling $48 million of restructuring cost in the fourth quarter, which impacted labor and fringe by $37 million and MS&O by $11 million in the prior year. Looking first at labor and fringe, we expect fourth quarter average headcount to be down slightly on a sequential basis. Although not to the same level we saw in the third quarter. Labor inflation is expected to be around $30 million in the fourth quarter, which we expect to be more than offset by continued efficiency and volume related cost savings. Similar to this quarter, we expect a headwind in the fourth quarter of about $40 million versus the prior year, driven by higher incentive compensation. As a reminder, in 2015 we saw incentive compensation decrease in the second half of the year. As sharp declines in the energy markets coupled with broad based commodity and dollar impact drove CSX\u2019s financial results will below our initial expectations. MS&O expenses expected to be relatively flat to the prior year with continued efficiency gains offsetting inflation. We expect fuel expense to decline the fourth quarter, with the higher cost per gallon year-over-year reflecting the current forward curve being more than offset by volume related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the fourth quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business, partially offset by the favorable impact of an equipment life study. Equipment and other rents in the fourth quarter are expected to be relatively flat to the prior year with the benefit of improved car cycle times offsetting higher freight car rates and the increase in volume related cost associated with automotive growth. Finally, fourth quarter expense will also be impacted by the extra week. And when we report earnings in the fourth quarter, we will provide detail to help you better understand the impact of the 53rd week. Now, let me wrap up on the next slide. With macroeconomic and energy headwinds impacting most market, CSX once again delivered solid financial results in the third quarter. This success is driven by pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment, which partially offset an 8% volume decline this quarter. To mitigate the weak demand we have taken significant cost actions this year, resulting in year-to-date efficiency savings of about $340 million and right sizing savings of around $200 million. We continue to pursue structural cost opportunity across the network and now expect full year efficiency savings to be about $400 million. Looking at our expectations for the fourth quarter, as I mentioned previously we expect volume to be relatively flat to last year, which includes the impact of the extra week. We remain intensely focused on pricing to the value of our service and expect our strong cost performance to continue into the fourth quarter. We will also be cycling an $80 million property gain from the prior year, which was below the line in other income in addition to cycling the $48 million in restructuring costs. As a result we expect fourth quarter earnings per share on a reported basis, including the impact of the extra week to be flat to slightly down versus the earnings we reported last year. With that let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks. Michael Ward : Thank you, Frank. As you heard today CSX is continue to drive results for shareholders in this dynamic business climate by aggressively managing cost and delivering record efficiency savings. The men and women of CSX are working relentlessly to safely, efficiently and successfully serve our customers. As we continue to manage through the current macroeconomic and energy environment we are simultaneously focused on positioning CSX to maximize opportunities going forward. The transformation into the CSX of tomorrow requires growth and increased profitability at our merchandise and intermodal businesses, while preserving the business value of coal as it becomes a smaller part of CSX going forward. With that focus we\u2019ll continue to drive earnings growth and margin expansion for our shareholders as we redeploy capital to further improve the network, support new technology solutions and automation and enhance merchandise and intermodal operations. With continued population growth as well as the challenges facing the trucking industry, we remain confident in the long-term secular growth prospects for domestic intermodal. In support of that vision we continue our multi-year strategy to add network capabilities and new service offerings. This strategy supports improved profitability and the ability to serve ever more service sensitive freight. As we look to the future our core earnings power remained strong and the CSX of tomorrow will continue delivering compelling shareholder value as we further progress towards the target of a mid-60s operating ratio longer term. And now we\u2019ll be pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is open you may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning Tom. Tom Wadewitz : Good morning, Michael, good morning everyone and congratulations on the really strong results on the cost side obviously good execution. Wanted to -- on that topic just wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts about the run rate the $400 million you\u2019re talking about this year is very strong and see stay well what is the pipeline look like and what is the run rate look like going forward is that something that you can potentially sustain at $300 million or $400 million in 2017? How would you -- can you offer some thoughts on the pipeline and how much is already done and what you can offer looking forward? Thanks. Cindy Sanborn : Okay, Tom good morning this is Cindy. Here\u2019s how I think about this year and going into next year. So when we as a company started looking at how coal was becoming less and less of our product mix or service product mix, we took a real hard look at how we needed to use our network differently to drive efficiencies, to drive margin expansion from the cost perspective. So a big portion of what you have seen here this year is looking at structural changes in the coal fields and we\u2019re lapping those this month actually when we shut down Erwin and Corbin and so those would not obviously repeat going into future years. But we\u2019re also have looked at driving density both on our routes, on our coal routes and density on our trains in terms of train link and while we are lapping some of the big steps that we were able to take with train links. We do see other opportunities for that it does require investments so the timing of it becomes contingent upon those investments being coming to provision. And then there is a traditional productivity that we look at and have over many, many years and technology is a huge part of that so we\u2019re streamlining, streamlining to align with our core network, our network of tomorrow. And so when I think about that type of technology or that type of productivity. I see next year looking a little bit more normalized in terms of run-rate around offsetting inflation around $150 million. But we don't put any upper limits on productivity. We are going to address and bring in everything we possibly can. And I think particularly technology lever is an exciting one for us both in terms of mobility and utilizing machine vision. And then other areas around predictive analytics to help us be more liable with our assets. So I think you'll see us we pulled a lot forward into this year, which is part of what you're pulling on. I think we'll see a more normal year next year, but we are not leaving anything on the table. Tom Wadewitz : So the 150 you mentioned that\u2019s a reasonable number to look at or that's kind of the core and you would expected to be beyond that? Cindy Sanborn : That\u2019s a reasonable number to look at based on the investments we're going to make coming to provision. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Allison. Danny Schuster : Hi, good morning this is Danny Schuster on for Allison. How are you doing this morning? Michael Ward : Good. Danny Schuster : So last year you had on a net basis a couple of pennies of one time benefits. So I guess I was just trying to understand if earnings are flat to slightly down in 4Q this year. Does that imply that core earnings are actually starting to grow? And should we see that trend accelerate with continued cost reductions, moderated coal volumes, export coal pricing for the next few quarters? Thank you. Frank Lonegro : Hey, Danny it's Frank. We try to do this some insight into Q4 on a reported against a reported basis, so flat to slightly down to try to give you a sense of some normal seasonality in the business quarter-over-quarter, as well as perhaps a little bit of conservatism around what the impacts of the hurricane are ultimately going to be. So we try to give you some clarity there. And I think what you're going to continue to see us do, as Cindy mentioned is continue to focus on a great service product and the productivity as well as strong pricing for the value of the service we provide. So the thesis will remain the same going forward. So I think we will try to give you some sense of where we'll end up the quarter and obviously that gives you some implication for the year and thinking about next year as well. Danny Schuster : Great, thank you Frank. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Rob Salmon : Hey, good morning, guys. Frank with your prior comments you alluded to incorporating some of a hurricane impact on the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense of what's baked into the model? And then aside related -- actually different question, but we saw some really nice improvement in the intermodal RPU last quarter. Could you talk about your pricing initiatives within that segment and how much of that improvement was kind of the lapping out of some of the shorter length default business? Frank Lonegro : Right so really three parts there I'll tackle the financial piece of the hurricane and kick it over to Cindy and let her talk about the hurricane impacts and then obviously Fredrick on the intermodal side. We're still early in the process of understanding the impact of the hurricane. Cindy will talk about where we are operationally. We do have something modelled in there, but it's really just an early estimate until we get everything back up and running. And we do the tally and we really don't have a good number for you this morning. We'll be out in early November and we'll certainly have all of the things tied up by then and we'll give you sense of the impact then. But let me let Cindy talk about the operational piece. Cindy Sanborn : Yeah as far as Hurricane Matthew, I think both from a preparation and recovery, our employees have done an outstanding job managing through a storm that was highly impactful in terms of the amount of territory that was affected. And so as of this morning, we are open on our core route on 995 albeit with the use of generators to provide power to our assets that require electricity crossings, and signalling systems with generators. And commercial power still not back we'll still be nursing those generators until we can get commercial power back. But opening that route is very, very important to us, it's part of triangle of core operations. We do have yet still some branch lines that are out. So unable to serve those customers as of this point, but we see good equipment availability and energy around getting those routes restored as well. And I think our impacts are going to be some will be capital, some will be operating expense. And then within that operating expense we'll see some cycle time impacts from the storm. But truthfully I am extremely pleased with where we are considering, where the hurricane affected us and how quickly we've been able to come back. Michael Ward : And Cindy on some of those secondary lines the water has not even peaked yet. So until it does it's hard to even get in there and assess the damage really. Cindy Sanborn : Yeah specifically in and around Lumberton North Carolina, we still have our railroad under several feet of water. And it's going to be days before those flood waters recede and obviously is affecting the community as well. And restoring service in all of these areas we feel like helps the communities recover as we bring in supply. So there is still quite a bit of work to do. Fredrik Eliasson : And then in terms of the intermodal question we are continuing to get some price in intermodal obviously not as much as we have in the past because of the excess capacity that's out in the marketplace that is offset by what we're seeing on a fuel side. But we are also seeing some positive mix in the portfolio. Part of that is some of the short haul business that has shifted over. So overall we're pretty pleased with the performance we\u2019ve seen from an RPU perspective in intermodal business. Rob Salmon : Well thanks so much for all the color and congrats on a great quarter and managing through really tough backdrop as well as even navigating the hurricane. Michael Ward : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Ravi. Ravi Shanker : Thanks good morning, everyone. So as a follow-up to that pricing question, your all in same-store pricing continues to remain above inflation which is great, but it has been sequentially declining a little bit. So how do we think about that in the fourth quarter and beyond? I mean what's the floor for that number, is at this level is that inflation? And does the bounce in export coal help you at all starting next quarter? Fredrik Eliasson : Sure so in terms of overall same store sale pricing we're obviously very transparent. What we're doing there each and every quarter you'll have an opportunity to see that in the fourth quarter. There is clearly more difficult sale environment and it's been there for a period of time as we see a significant amount of excess capacity. Our focus continues to be to price the value that we provide our customer to be able to continue to reinvest. We have an improved service product year-over-year that is very helpful. And what we are trying to do is to sell through this trough so to speak and sale that kind of the long-term access to a network and the capacity that we have. Specifically to export coal, I think we've been very transparent over the last couple of year that as the market has gone tougher since 2012 we have been taking our prices down to obviously optimize our own portfolio, but also to help strategically with some of the producers. We do have the ability to touch those contracts on essentially quarterly basis or some of those are index. And so with the uptick and the benchmark that we've seen here which obviously gives us an opportunity to leverage that uptick which is good news. Ravi Shanker : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Ken. Ken Hoexter : Great, good morning, thanks Michael. Just wanted to talk, you mentioned to Tom earlier about increasing car lengths and maybe more investments. Cindy is this something you need to make additional CapEx and spending on to be able to get even longer train lengths, is that something that you're starting to peak out or is there still additional room for productivity improvement? Cindy Sanborn : Yeah, Ken. So I would say that we are making investments I've been talking the last couple of quarters about our route from Nashville to Cincinnati that we were investing in this year, that that would be in service as if the third quarter. So it is in service and we have seen some good improvement in link there. We were restricted to based on sidings to about 6,500 feet on that corridor. So it's that type of investment that we will continue across there about 12,000 feet. So moving forward, we have identified locations to continue those types of investments. But as you relieve the pressure on the corridor that we just did, then you now find that you're meeting up against some other impacts on other corridor. So that's where we'll be looking and are looking in the process of assessing and or building to continue to improving train length. Frank Lonegro : And Ken one other thing on CapEx, what Cindy is referring to is absolutely what we're going to do going forward it's a reallocation of capital within that longer term guidance that we've spoken about previously. So as you go into 2017 the things that are strategically aligned in terms of the network of the tomorrow highly automated railroads, service excellence, et cetera. Those are going to be within the compliance of the normal capital process. And as you size that next year I wouldn't think of that as being incremental investment versus reallocated investment within that portfolio. Ken Hoexter : That\u2019s really helpful, thanks, Frank. Just Fred a follow-up if I may, on coal your thoughts on utility on where inventory levels are this is really interesting just given I don\u2019t know maybe the extended heat that we had here, but is there stabilization going on a domestic side and your thoughts are we at an inflection points perhaps where I don\u2019t know if inventory levels have come down far enough far enough or if net gas pricing is high enough you maybe just throw us some thoughts on the domestic side? Fredrik Eliasson : Sure so clearly the hot summer has been helpful the cooling degree days has been very helpful especially in the South we\u2019ve seen significant reduction in the inventory levels, I think in the South in terms of days burn we\u2019re down to from 150 a year ago to somewhere around 100 now. And even in North we have come down a little bit, I would say though overall that they\u2019re probably still slightly above where they would like for them to be, in certain places they are less, certain places they are more, but they\u2019re probably still a little bit above where they would like it for them to be. But it is good news that we\u2019re starting to see that and also to your point about natural gas prices they have come up a little bit, that\u2019s also helpful. But generally though we do need to see those natural gas prices closer to 350 or above to make really meaningful impact and we\u2019re excited where we\u2019re heading we\u2019ll have a much better view I think as we get into the fourth quarter and early next year in terms of what coal will do for 2017 not just on the domestic side, but also on the export side. Ken Hoexter : Thanks for the thoughts. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Brandon. Brandon Oglenski : Hey good morning, Michael and thanks for taking my questions. So when I look at these efficiency numbers, they are pretty big. When we\u2019re talking [indiscernible] $300 million to $400 million in efficiency this year, that would equate I don\u2019t know maybe greater than 3% on the operating ratio to 300 basis points. So I mean is that the type of improvement that investors should be thinking about as we look into \u201817 and beyond can we start to see 100-200 basis points improvement annually and the operating ratio if these efficiency targets hold and you get to a more stable or maybe even a growth environment? Cindy Sanborn : So I think as I said before we had a pretty extraordinary year this year, which you\u2019re referring to which is part of our views on how our business mix has changed with a less reliance upon coal. And so there are some structural takeout that we put in place that can\u2019t repeat because it is structural around the coal markets. But going forward we have lapsed for this year some of our train link initiatives. But as I mentioned in the last question we see opportunities going forward, we see productivity available to us that we traditionally have around streamlining again around our core network, which is part of our network of tomorrow. But I think run rate wise looking into 2017 it would be more of a $150 million offsetting inflation kind of number to face off of after having such a strong year this year. But we don\u2019t stop thinking about ways to improve our efficiencies we understand that as our business mix changes, have to make our merchandise and intermodal our service products more profitable and from a cost -- and the operating department has a huge lever we have to pull on the cost side to make that happen. So we\u2019re going to continue to look for those opportunities and drive it forward and I will say adding to that that we also are going to serve our customers effectively to provide a very good service for them that allows Fredrik to grow the business and price the business. Michael Ward : Brandon one other thought is in terms of your allusion to growth there as we grow especially if we grow in class merchandise business in automotive and intermodal I mean you are going to see incremental margins that really pull on the operating leverage point. So in addition to the productivity line you should see the benefit of that again if the economy is cooperative for us longer term. Cindy Sanborn : Yeah I should add we do see capability of adding growth in pretty much any market without adding cost back one for one. So we do see great leverage there. Brandon Oglenski : Well I guess I don\u2019t want to be too critical here, but if what you\u2019re doing is offsetting inflation next year let\u2019s say on the productivity side this is going to come off as critical but how is the CSX of tomorrow any different than grow to 65 by 2015, which we heard in 2011? It just sounds like it\u2019s going to be a struggle to get a lot of operating ratio improvement unless something changes on the demand side or am I thinking about that wrong? Cindy Sanborn : I mean, I think there is no -- everything on the table has been for as long as I've worked here. And we are continuing to make sure that there is any opportunity we have we're going to take advantage of. So I think to your point it may seem not as strong as this year, but our objectives are to not just look at 2017 by itself, but also continuing into the future and drive operating margins on the cost side. And we're coming off a strong year. We think we can offset inflation next year, but we are not going to leave any opportunity out there on the cost side. Michael Ward : Brandon this Michael, I mean obviously productivity is going to be key and as Cindy said always strive to do more than what she is talking about. But growth does have to be a critical component as we move to the mid-60s operating ratio. We've got already tempered economy here for the last two years and clearly growth has to be part of that equation. And we think with the service partners we have Fredrick's team can grow it once we see any signs of vibrant in the economy, but that is part of the equation. Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah I mean Brandon we're confident in our ability to get to the mid-60s operating ratio. The timing of that is going to depend on the rate of decline in coal obviously. But continuing to focus on value pricing for the service product that we provide to our customers continuing to have productivity offset inflation. I mean you do get margin expansion by doing that year-over-year. Brandon Oglenski : Okay, appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMC. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Brian. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning thanks for getting me on the call here. So question on the coal network and rationalizing that further, obviously you made some actions with Erwin and Corbin that you're going to lap here pretty soon into next year. So what are you looking at when it comes to being able to take the next steps? Is it just coal volumes getting to a certain level, density is perhaps getting a little bit higher when you factor in some of the point-to-point pricing. So just kind of your thought process in how you -- what will you think just generally on timing for some of these initiatives to keep initiatives to keep moving in the coal fields? Cindy Sanborn : Well I think we are going to serve our coal customers well. And that is Fredrick and I work and our teams work on that to make sure that we are available and capable of providing service to our coal customers. As things changed within the coal field even more than they already have, we will take the steps that we need to take to structurally change along with those changes. So we are prepared to continue to look there, but it's a profitable business for us and we intend to stay in that business where the customers are for as long as they are there. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, thanks Cindy. Just Michael one follow-up on the growth that you mentioned. Port of Savannah was out maybe a couple of weeks ago now announcing a large expansion of the rail terminal there. It looks like they're going to double the capacity longer trains to facility. Is that volume starting to be spoken for attracting customers or do you really need to see the Port finish the complete expansion sometime in 2020 before that we really start to drive some more volume on your network? Thanks. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure this is Fredrick, so what we're seeing and have been seeing is a continued shift towards more East Coast internationally intermodal coming in versus West Coast. And as a result the ports are clearly making investment not just Savannah, but other ports as well. And we are as well to make sure we can serve that. And that is attractive business that we want to get more of. And as we see additional investments come online we'll have an opportunity. In the Savannah case we certainly have grown our business significantly there already. And we expect to continue to see that going forward. But that is true for the other ports as well. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, thanks Fredrick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Wetherbee with Citigroup. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Christian. Christian Wetherbee : Good morning, guys. My question is on CapEx, just kind of wondering as we look at the year-to-date progress so far towards the $2.7 billion number. There is still a lot left to go here, but I don't think you're kind a taking that 2.7 number down. I'm guessing that locomotive pull forward from 2017 might that will be backend weighted and might be part of that sort of $1 billion plus that I think you're targeting for the fourth quarter. But just wanted to get a rough sense of maybe how we think about this number? And maybe thinking a little bit longer term to a previous question Frank you said it's sort of a reallocation and sort of where you're spending the capital. What is the right number to be thinking about of that reallocated capital is it a percent of revenue, is it an absolute number in the mid $2 billion type of range? I just want to get a rough sense of maybe how to think about that? Frank Lonegro : Sure, hey Chris, Frank. So, on the 2.7, that is what we call our managed capital number, as part of that you\u2019ll have two things in there, you\u2019ll have the $300 million that we pulled forward from the seller financing of next year into this year and paying off locomotives as delivered. The other piece which will show up in other financing activities so not in the property additions line will be $300 million for paying off engines that we took delivery of last year. So, your 2.7 is again, we\u2019re trying to be very transparent with you in terms of the capital dollars that we\u2019re spending this year, although you do have some geography differences on the cash flow statement. In terms of 2017, when you think about where we are, we are looking very hard at infrastructure and equipment given the environment that we\u2019re in and given the network of tomorrow strategy that we have. What we have been talking about is normalized five or ten year view in retrospect for CapEx we generally spend somewhere between 12% and 15% of that capital portfolio on return seeking investments. But we\u2019re looking forward to doing on a going forward basis is to increase that allocation to more like 20% or 25% of the capital portfolio. So, not looking to necessarily increase capital based on the strategy, really looking to reallocate to make sure that we\u2019re focused on the things that are going to drive the value in the future. Christian Wetherbee : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that color and then the follow-up just sort of in the context of capital allocation across sort of the spectrum. When you think about next year, debt levels relative to share buybacks how does share buyback kind of pay into the long-term plan? Frank Lonegro : Sure. It\u2019s part of the balanced deployment of capital certainly the primary focus of capital is going to be to reinvest in the business for a reliable railroad in accretive type investments. Secondarily would be the dividend piece and obviously we are looking hard at that since we took a break this year on the dividend, but we\u2019re going to look hard at that next year. And then looking at where we are on operating cash flow next year and sizing buyback program that generally we talk to you about in the end of the first quarter of the given year. So, I think that order is important for the investors to keep in mind, and realizing that the environment that we are in now is perhaps quite a bit different than the environment that we were in 2015 when we increased the dividend by $0.02 and announced the two year $2 billion program that will complete by April of next year. Christian Wetherbee : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for the time, I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Your line is open, go ahead with your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Bas. Bascome Majors : Hey, thank you, good morning. Frank, I want to drill down on another answer on the margins and cost side. Given the cost take out that you have achieved over the last several quarters, that\u2019s been a while sense since we\u2019ve had a year where you went from a big revenue decline to potentially return to growth and your best incrementals of the resent years have been around 50% on the margin side. I am just curious not necessarily saying that revenue will return next year, but when it does return given the takeout you\u2019ve done what kind of incremental ballpark are you thinking about in the business? Frank Lonegro : When you look at what we\u2019ve done on the cost side, certainly that sets up incremental margins that are probably better than what they have been historically, but as I\u2019ve alluded to in the answer to the earlier question it really depends on how the business comes back. If it comes back in areas where you\u2019re adding a box car on to an existing train, an intermodal container on to an existing train, an auto rack on to an existing train that\u2019s really where you\u2019re going to get the incremental margins and the operating leverage that you\u2019re referring to if it\u2019s something that\u2019s on the box side of the business, which is going to be a new train start. The incremental margins are going to essentially be what the absolute margins are in that business by and large. So, I do think we\u2019ve set ourselves up for a good run as the economic improves and as volumes comes back especially on the class side of the business. Bascome Majors : Thank you for that. And just a bit of a housekeeping on your cost guidance for 4Q, the MS&O guide of flat year-over-year that signaling a pretty significant Q-over-Q growth maybe 12% or so. And I know you have the extra week but that\u2019s maybe 10 points or so above the typical sequential growth there. Can you just help us understand what\u2019s driving that beside above and beyond the extra week? Frank Lonegro : Yeah, there is a few things on the sequential side to think through given that we have got some incremental bulk business on the export side, the grain side and the automotive side; we have got additional engines in freight cars in the mix relative to third quarter. So, clearly that\u2019s going to impact MS&O line on the materials and supply side. We are expecting normal seasonality in terms of normal winter, we didn\u2019t see necessarily as much of that last year, but we\u2019re expecting this year just given what we understand the winter to hold, there is a normal seasonal shift between the third quarter and the fourth quarter as we stop the construction season as it gets too cold and too icy to work up North. So we do have that and then there\u2019s normally on the technology side as annual hardware software maintenance contracts come due so we have that just in terms of seasonality. And then we\u2019re usually a little less fuel efficient as we get into the fourth quarter and we\u2019re going to pull on everything as you\u2019ve seen us do already this year, but as we set up a more normal fourth quarter that\u2019s how we see it going. The other thing to think through is a lot of the hurricane side expenses to the extent that hit the OpEx line are going to hit here. So we got a little bit of piece in there. And then when you look at the productivity as we\u2019ve targeted about $400 million it implies about a $60 million run rate for the quarter and that\u2019s a little less than what we have seen in the third quarter. So you add all that up and it\u2019s going to be about flat on a year-over-year basis. Bascome Majors : Thank you for your time. Frank Lonegro : Thanks Bascome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Scott. Scott Group : Hey, thanks good morning, guys. Wanted to just go back to coal for a second, Fredrick do you have the inventory levels for the North? And then on the met side how quickly do the export rates reset higher and can you just kind of frame what that opportunity is and maybe how much of the export rates dropped over the past five years? And kind of order of magnitude how much do you think that they can rebound? Fredrik Eliasson : Sure in terms of the inventory levels we use Pyra data so in the North we went from about 95 days of burn, at this time last year we\u2019re down to 90 now and in the South 150 down to 102. So significant improvement, but as I said earlier still above what I would consider target level at this time of the year. But this target has obviously changed little bit more little more difficult these days because it depends on lot of where the utility is in the dispatch order, et cetera. To your question about met obviously it\u2019s come down significantly and I don\u2019t have a number that I think we\u2019ve shared before, but it is a significant adjustment and you\u2019ve seen that play out in our RPU line since really since 2012. And as we now sit here and we\u2019ve seen the benchmark go up to 200 from 90 to 50 I think it was in the third quarter that is an opportunity for us to leverage. And our contract have evolved overtime to be essentially quarterly or based on an index that is tied to the benchmark. Scott Group : Okay. And then just lastly for Frank I know we\u2019ve got big incentive comp headwind in fourth quarter, third quarter should we be thinking about a similar large headwind in the first half of next year too or do we kind of moved to more of a normalized incentive comp run rate on a year-over-year basis \u201817? Frank Lonegro : Yeah, more normalized. Scott Group : Okay perfect. All right thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Jason. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone, I guess I\u2019ll piggy back a little bit on that coal question, when you talk about more normalized target levels where would you put those target level in both your southern and northern regions? Fredrik Eliasson : Well as I said in the past we have used the targeted days burn somewhere around 55 in the North, 70 in the South. However I do think that I could be a little bit misleading these days because of the fact that utilities are situated very differently in terms of where they are in the dispatch order. It was easier to give those target levels in the past when you were the base load. Now it varies really by utility-by-utility, but the good news is we made significant in-roads especially in the South and we\u2019re getting closer to a more normalized level and there are utilities and we\u2019ve seen this year over the last three months that clearly are below where they want to be, but we still have several utilities that are significantly above. Jason Seidl : Okay. And when you look at sort of that 350 bogie you brought up with natural gas, if we are well above that for a considerable amount of time what percent of the business do you think of your coal business is going to be positively affected by that? Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah so if you look at where we were here this quarter we had about 58% of our business either came from Illinois Basin or Powder River Basis. We saw a pretty significant shift towards Illinois basin within that number. And we have said publically that when it is 350 or above that part of our portfolio so 58% of portfolio is essentially in the money. And that will allow for a significant increased utilization of those plants. Now there is a lot of other factors that plays into that. Clearly whether the plants are located makes a big difference. As you all know that the natural gas prices are 350 is Henry Hub price. It is very different in certain parts of our service territory. But as a general rule I still think that holds pretty well in terms of indication over the plants that we serve become more competitive. Jason Seidl : Thank you and that was very helpful. I guess my follow-up question is going to be on the pricing side, when you look at intermodal merchandise still well above your cost inflation, but it did decelerate on a sequential basis. How are you thinking about sort of that truck competitive market going forward? It looks like we've had a little bit of uptick on the spot side here and with ELDs coming up. What are you guys looking for in \u201817 on that market? Fredrik Eliasson : Sure, I mean it is clear that we've had a tough market for an extended period of time now in terms of excess capacity. And it does impact not just intermodal business, but certain markets within our merchandise business as well. Generally shorter haul also generally lower contributory traffic that are more susceptible to being switched over to truck. As the market turns and it will turn we see new orders of truck of Class A trucks have come down significantly 30% 40% year-over-year , year-to-date. We know ELDs will be coming in by sometime in the second half of next year. And if the economy continues to expand and unemployment stays low that should lead to a much better environment as we get into late \u201817 and that will be helpful. So our challenge to our team right now is to sell that improved service product that we have sell through this kind of trough and sell the long-term access to our network that allows us to continue to reinvest in our business. Jason Seidl : Fredrik thank you for all that color and everyone thank you for your time as always. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird. Your line is open, go ahead with your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Ben. Ben Hartford : Hey, good morning all. Cindy could you talk about when you would anticipate a trough in the employee count, is there any sort of visibility to that during the fourth quarter or in the early part of 2017? Frank Lonegro : Hey it's Frank. What we did was we guided to down slightly sequentially, but also put a bit of a qualifier on that one given the fact that we were probably down more than slightly sequentially from Q2 to Q3. So we're continuing to look across the board at all areas of resources whether it's train and engine crews or folks in the rest of the operating department and folks on the G&A side, I mean which you\u2019ve seen is and across the board approach in terms of overall productivity as well as on the resource side and challenging the need for every dollar and every vacancy when it comes up we're taking a look at it and making sure whether or not we need to fill that. So I think you're going to see us focused, although the magnitude of the decreases on a year-over-year basis are obviously going to get smaller and smaller as we go forward. But you'll continue to see us look very hard at resources. Cindy you want to add anything to that? Cindy Sanborn : I think you hit it. Ben Hartford : Good. And then Fredrick if I could ask you just more of a conceptual question on the volume side, volumes over the past 10 or 15 years have been flattish to even down, obviously coal the coal headwind have been noted. So as we look forward the economic environment uncertain if we use industrial production growth as a guide. Do you have confidence or any sort of visibility to volume growth more closely approximating even whatever U.S. IP growth ends up being as coal as we transition away from coal given the volume growth opportunities longer term on the intermodal side. Or is that 10 to 15 year trend of kind of flattish volumes in the business. Is that still a pretty appropriate bogie to think about over the three to five years? Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah, I think absolutely. I think that if you look at long period of time if you take out the coal business you just look at the correlation between IDP in our merchandise business it has correlated pretty well where they probably with a slightly underperformed IDP over an extended period of time several decades. As I think about 2017, right now and obviously we are in the middle of our planning season and getting a lot of feedback for our customer, if you take out our coal business and also the crude-by-rail business which is energy related, if you take that out and we look at the rest of the portfolio our merchandise and our intermodal business we feel pretty good about what the portfolio can do here after a very tough period of time. And then we have pretty good confident that based on the economic indicators we\u2019re seeing right now based on the feedback from the customer that we can return to more normalized growth environment next year in our non-energy businesses. We will have a much better sense of the energy businesses as we get through the fourth quarter, but we are encouraged by what we are seeing in terms of our initial planning assumptions right now. Ben Hartford : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Your line is open, you may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning Cherilyn. Q - Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. One of the things that really stood out in the quarter for me was just the year-over-year improvement in labor efficiency, just given the volume decline that you were facing. Just wondering if you can give us some practical examples of how you are continuing to generate that labor productivity? Cindy Sanborn : Hi, Cherilyn thanks. I think one of the better examples would be our longer train initiatives so looking at density of trains and being able to operate the same number of cars with in fewer chunks. I think we also are utilizing technology to help us as well and being able to automate processes. So those are probably two of the bigger examples I could give you. Frank Lonegro : And make sure just in terms of sort of raw orders of magnitude the 3,900 or so positions that we were down year-over-year, the majority of those and this is both the efficiency side as well as the volume variable side come out of the train and engine mechanical and the op support side of the business, but engineering, intermodal, G&A are also down year-over-year I mean we are down across the board in terms of resources on a year-over-year basis. And I think you are going to continue with perhaps the exception of technology as we really go into the highly automated railroad part of our strategy, I mean pretty much every group is trying to be as lean as they can. Cherilyn Radbourne : Great, Thank you. That\u2019s all for me. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open, go ahead with your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, David. David Vernon : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on the productivity here, this is obviously been the big part of the story this year. As we think about next year and the growth being a little bit more in the scheduled network businesses around merchandise and intermodal. Should we be thinking that the incremental fall through on that businesses could actually be a little bit better than maybe we have seen the incremental margins on average run in the past? Frank Lonegro : Yeah I think with the expenses that we have taken out in the scheduled network and sort of across the board that obviously sets us up for incremental margins that are healthy and perhaps a little bit better than they have been in the past. So, yes, this is the answer to the question. David Vernon : Excellent. And then maybe just kind of if we think about the business in the couple of years let\u2019s say if we\u2019re kind of flat in volume, obviously the productivity has been a big of it, but how should we be thinking about the sort of organic earnings potential in the business over the next couple years? Do you mean is it possible to continue to pull out cost and grow for a few years or do you think it\u2019s going to be a little bit more of kind of holding the line just in kind of a flat growth environment? Frank Lonegro : I think you are flat on volume and don\u2019t have any mix impacts associated with it, it\u2019s really going to be what we\u2019ve been able to do in the past which is we\u2019ll continue to offset inflation with productivity, we\u2019ll continue to have value pricing that will fall to the bottom-line and the combination of those two things. We\u2019ll provide margin expansion on a year-over-year in the environment that you mentioned. David Vernon : So you see, you actually expects a little bit of sustainable earnings power even if there was a little even we\u2019re in a flat volume environment? Frank Lonegro : Correct. David Vernon : Excellent. Thanks very much for your time guys and congratulations about the great quarter. Frank Lonegro : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Your line is open, go ahead with your question. Michael Ward : Good morning. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks, good morning. Automotive remains an area of strength for you, just curious how sustainable do you think it is just from an end market perspective and also you sight new business ramp ups in the slide deck. What type of contribution should we think about over the coming quarters there? Thanks. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure, so, obviously auto has been at a pretty high level here this year in terms of production I think the latest estimate that I've seen is about 79 in terms of production. We're more closely tied to production and the sales. And next year the latest estimate that I have is a slight increase to about 18 million vehicles and so that's helpful. We have onboard some new customers this year that has helped. And the contribution of that traffic is very attractive. And it has been great journey for the automotive market overall coming out of recession. But it is probably fair to say that at the moment it looks like we're hitting that high watermark so to speak. We don\u2019t see necessarily coming down significantly from that. We think we're going to move more inline what we're currently seeing. But obviously we're being nimble there as well and to adjust our resource level whether it's up or down. But right now the best estimate is for relatively flat environment for 2017. Scott Schneeberger : Great, thanks. And then Cindy just following up on efficiency savings so we can infer here that you're looking for maybe a base level of 150 as we look out into \u201817 as we look at our models and think about kind of the cadence through next year. Is there anything special to keep in mind down that front or it's just a progressive build? Thanks. Cindy Sanborn : Yeah, I don't think there is anything specific that would cause you to want to put different values and for the different quarters. It will be pretty much across the board even. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Go ahead with your question, your line is open. Michael Ward : Good morning, Justin. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. So my first question was on coal. There are a lot of people that believe industry coal volumes will be up next year. I know you said 4Q whether it will be important in terms of how things play out in 2017. But just assuming normal weather patterns, do you have any high level directional thoughts on how your coal volumes could trend next year? Fredrik Eliasson : Well I guess the only directional comment that I would say is that it looks like by the end of this year over a five year period we would have lost about $2 billion of coal revenue. And this year alone probably in excess of $0.5 billion. So based on what we're seeing right now, we think next year's decline will be significantly less than that. But beyond that, I really do think I want to stick with what I said earlier which is that we'll have update for you when we do the fourth quarter earnings call both on a domestic side and on the export side. Because I think I think we'll be in a much better position as we are in the process of gathering our information from the utilities the 40 to 50 utilities that we serve. And I think that's the best way to give you guidance is to take the input that we get from them. So that it's a lot more accurate than trying to speculate at this point. Justin Long : Got it. But you seem to imply with your commentary that directionally you think it will be down next year. You're just not willing at this point to quantify that? Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah, I think that's probably directional what I'm trying to say. I think that clearly the fact that natural gas prices are come up is helpful, it is still not at 350. Inventory levels are still above what they should be. And we only have about 1 million tons or so that probably will come out next year in terms of plant closure. So that number is getting a lot smaller. But nevertheless I think as we look at the crystal ball right now, that is probably a safe place to be. But as I said a cold winter natural gas prices move up above the 350 mark. And that picture can change very rapidly. Justin Long : Thanks, that's really helpful. And one quick follow-up I wanted to ask on pricing. Fredrick I believe you said you were still getting price in intermodal. But could you say if your intermodal pricing is above inflation or given the truck competition we're seeing. Are we seeing below inflation price increases in that intermodal business? Fredrik Eliasson : We've historically given you the breakdown in the two categories that we have merchandise and intermodal combined in all end. I think we'll stay at that level. Pricing is a critical part for us in order to continue to reinvest in the business and especially in the intermodal since we put so much of our incremental capital towards intermodal. So being able to have the traffic at contributory levels we continue to push prices is a critical part of that strategy. And we are getting positive price exactly where it is. I think we'll keep those buckets that we have in place today. Justin Long : Okay, fair enough. I appreciate the time and congrats on the quarter. Operator : Thank you. And next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, go ahead with your question. Suneel Manhas : Good morning, this is Suneel Manhas stepping in for Walter Spracklin. So just circling back you mentioned how your East Coast volumes are seeing a bit of a bump and just wondering how much of that volume bump is coming to the Panama Canal? And are you seeing shifting of buy patterns, and how should we think about that impact moving forward? Thanks so much. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure, so this is Fredrik again. We have seen the shift for an extended period of time, that we see more of our international cargo coming in on the East Coast porch. We have not seen a significant change in the amount of volume coming in since the Panama Canal got widened. What we are seeing that there are some bigger vessels coming in, but generally it is not necessarily adding capacity. They are reconfiguring the strengths, there are fewer vessels and we\u2019re also seeing some realignment with vessels that before came through the Suez Canal that is now coming through the Panama Canal instead. But we are -- so there\u2019s not significant change, but the pattern has been there for a long time and we do expect that pattern to continue that we will be more and more of that volume come through the East Coast porch. Suneel Manhas : Got it, okay thanks so much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you our final question comes from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open, go ahead with your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Brian. Brian Konigsberg : Hey, good morning guys thanks for taking my question. You guys covered quite a bit of ground, just question on inflation it sounds just on the commentary in regards to efficiency, do you still expect it to remain pretty muted next year in the realm of 1.5%, but just looking at the labor, some cost incremental you\u2019re talking about for Q4 that\u2019s running around 4% probably includes a little bit extra from the extra week. And then just metal prices have been strong maybe rolling up a little bit now, but is the expectation you were still going to be living in a pretty muted environment into \u201817 despite some of the indicators that say it could be a little bit higher? Frank Lonegro : Yeah I think on the inflation side we have been in a little bit of a muted environment here in the last couple of years. When you start thinking about the inflation more broadly, as well as GDP and IDP potentially going up there could be a little bit of a pressure on the upside, there is a little bit of nuance in the second half of the year before they were infringe inflation that you\u2019re picking up on which is wage accruals that came up starting in the middle of the year. So there\u2019s that in there rather than a sort of a core external inflation run rate that\u2019s out there. But I think what you\u2019re hearing from us is regardless of what inflation is we\u2019re going to do our level best to more than offset that with productivity. So I think having something in that 150, 175 range for inflation next year is probably a good start in place and we\u2019ll offset that with productivity. Brian Konigsberg : Great. If I could just follow a real quick one just on the intermodal and the expectation that I guess pricing does firm a little bit later next year has supply in trucking comes down and ELD go into place does that assumption -- does it require improving demand for you to see improving pricing in that business or if we ran it just kind of where we stand today does that make it a bit more challenging? Fredrik Eliasson : Yeah, I mean it really is supply and demand picture so if you have ELDs and other regulatory constraints put pressure on the supply side clearly additional growth in economy is also helpful. And if you remove one or two of those it\u2019s going to prolong the period where we see this excess capacity. So we\u2019re obviously following this very closely and hoping for an economy that picks up more than we currently expect that could be very helpful both in terms of our volume initiatives, but also in terms of pricing. Brian Konigsberg : Understood, great thanks guys. Michael Ward : Thank you we\u2019ll see you all next time, next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. You may disconnect your lines.",

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. David Baggs : Thank you, Sherlyn, and good morning, again everyone and welcome to CSX Corporation's fourth quarter 2016 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we'll reviewing this morning along with our expanded quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at CSX.com under the Investor section. In addition, following the presentation, the webcast replay will be available on that same website. This morning, our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Frank Lonegro, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Cindy Sanborn, our Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer will be available during the question-and-answer session. Now, before I turn the presentation over to Michael, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company's disclosure and the accompanying presentation on Slide two. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements, as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. With over 30 analysts covering CSX and out of respect for everyone's time, including our investors, I would ask as a courtesy for you to please limit your inquiries to one question and one follow-up question. And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation's Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael? Michael Ward : Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Yesterday CSX reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.49, up from $0.48 per share in the same period last year. You will note that fourth quarter of 2016 included two offsetting items. In addition, the quarter included an extra accounting week resulting from the company's 52, 53 week fiscal reporting calendar. This benefited EPS by $0.03 in the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue increased 9% in the quarter driven by the benefit of an extra accounting week and strong pricing gains that reflect the value of our service products. Turning to operations, safety performance remained strong, service levels continue to meet or exceed customer expectations, and the company drove nearly $100 million in efficiency gains in the quarter. As a result, CSX produced $1 billion of operating income and a 67% operating ratio. Both of these results reflect the benefit of the extra week and a gain on a recent operating property sale. Now, I'll turn the presentation over to Frank, who will take us through the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results in more detail as well as providing our initial views on the outlook for 2017. Frank? Frank Lonegro : Thank you, Michael, and good morning everyone. Revenue was up 9% or $256 million versus the prior year driven primarily by higher volumes as a result of the extra week. Total reported volume increased 5% in the quarter, but declined 1% excluding the extra week. We continue to deliver strong core pricing from an improved service product. Same-store sales pricing for the fourth quarter was up 2.8% overall and 3.2% excluding coal. In addition, fuel recoveries declined $10 million in the fourth quarter, but were more than offset by a $13 million increase in other revenue. Expenses increased 2% versus the prior year, driven mainly by the impact of the extra week. Excluding the extra week, expense declined 4%. In the fourth quarter CSX delivered $98 million in efficiency gains and we also recognized a $115 million gain from the sale of an operating property. Further year-over-year expense details can be found in our quarterly financial report. Operating income was just over $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year, reflecting the impact of the extra week. Other income decreased to $72 million driven primarily by an $18 million gain related to a non-operating property sale in the prior year's fourth quarter. In addition, we incurred $115 million of debt repurchase expense in the fourth quarter associated with the call of $1.4 billion of debt that was maturing between 2017 and 2019. Finally, income taxes were $293 million in the fourth quarter with an effective tax rate of about 39%. This included a $10 million unfavorable adjustment related to the apportionment of state income taxes, which impacted EPS by $0.01. Overall net earnings were $458 million, down 2% versus the prior year and EPS was $0.49 per share, up 2% versus the prior year. Now let me provide an adjusted view of our full-year EPS. Beginning with our full-year GAAP EPS of $1.81 we have provided the EPS impact of certain items that all occurred in the fourth quarter. You can see that the $0.08 property gain I mentioned previously was equally offset by the $0.08 impact from the debt repurchase expense in the fourth quarter. In addition, our 2016 EPS benefited $0.03 from the impact of the extra week. Excluding the impact of the extra week and the two offsetting items CSX's 2016 non-GAAP EPS is $1.78, which reflects a more normalized base for year-over-year comparisons. Now let me turn to the market outlook for the first quarter. We expect volume to be flat to slightly up year-over-year in the first quarter, as the industrial economy is stabilizing and energy related headwinds are moderating slightly. That said, a number of our markets are returning to year-over-year growth in the quarter as we cycle the challenging conditions of early 2016. As you can see on the slide nearly 80% of volume falls in the neutral or favorable category in the first quarter, while a little over 20% of the portfolio is expected to be unfavorable. Agriculture and food is expected to grow as the record grain harvest and new customer facilities are expected to more than offset the strength in U.S. dollar and a strong South American crop which curtails the U.S. grain export season earlier than normal. Export coal will continue to benefit from China's production cuts driving increased demand for U.S. coal. In particular, the metallurgical benchmark has strengthened year-over-year attracting increased production from U.S. coal producers entering 2017. We expect export tonnage in the quarter to be about 8 million tons. For the full-year 2017, we expect export coal to be in the mid-to-high 20 million ton range. Metals and equipment is favorable as imports moderate compared to last year and domestic steel production increases following successful trade cases. Additional infrastructure projects, increasing rig counts, and wind energy moves, are expected to provide additional volume opportunity. Intermodal is expected to be neutral. On the domestic side, secular growth will continue spurred by new service offerings and our highway to rail program. However, this growth is mostly offset by domestic competitive loss that occurred mid last year. On the international side, volumes are also expected to be roughly flat as we just finished cycling prior year competitive losses earlier this month. Chemicals will be down as the economics of crude-by-rail remain unfavorable. These headwinds are partially offset by higher volume in the fly ash business, which began moving a year ago and ramped up over several quarters to current levels. Domestic coal is also expected to be down, although we are seeing moderating inventory levels and slightly increased coal demand with winter weather, a shortfall competitive loss will result in lower volume for the quarter. As a result, we expect domestic coal tonnage to be around 15 to 16 million tons for the first quarter. Overall the industrial economy is more stable and energy headwinds are moderating. However, we continue to face a strong U.S. dollar and low commodity prices which constrains growth in some markets. As we think about the full-year 2017, we anticipate a healthier volume environment. As a result, we expect the combination of merchandise and intermodal to grow on a comparable 52-week basis in line with the economy. In addition, excluding the short haul competitive loss of about 6 million tons, we expect domestic coal tonnage to be roughly flat to 2016. Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the quarter. As a result of aggressive cost actions taken in 2016, we achieved nearly $430 million of efficiency savings and about $175 million of volume related cost saving. As we turn to 2017, our intense focus on driving cost reductions across the Company is unchanged and we are targeting full-year efficiency savings of more than $150 million. Looking at the first quarter outlook for labor and fringe, we expect average headcount to be down slightly on a sequential basis. Labor inflation is expected to be around $35 million in the first quarter. In addition, we expect our pension expense to decrease about $15 million versus the prior year in each quarter of 2017. This reduction is driven primarily by adopting the spot rate accounting methodology for applying the discount rate, as well as the benefit associated with $250 million pension contribution completed in the fourth quarter. The combination of efficiency savings and lower pension costs is expected to more than offset labor inflation. For MS&O expense, we expect efficiency gains in the quarter to help offset inflation. However, we will also be cycling some positive reserve adjustments, for example, improved safety performance in last year's first quarter favorably reduced personal injury reserves. As a result, we expect MS&O in total to be slightly up versus the prior year. We expect fuel expense to increase in the first quarter, driven by the higher cost per gallon year-over-year reflecting the current forward curve. This price increase is partially offset by our continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the first quarter to increase around $10 million versus the prior year reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. This is partially offset by the favorable impact from an equipment life study. Finally, equipment and other rents in the first quarter are expected to be relatively flat to the prior year with the benefit of improved car cycle times offsetting higher freight car rates and the increase in volume related costs associated with automotive growth. Now let me talk about our capital investment plan for 2017. For this year, CSX's total capital investment would decrease to $2.2 billion, which includes about $270 million for Positive Train Control. As you will recall, our 2016 capital investment totaled $2.7 billion which included $307 million of payments in 2016 for locomotives purchased under seller financing and delivered in 2015. As a result, we expect our 2017 capital investment to decline nearly $500 million from the 2016 level and begin returning to our long-term core capital investment guidance of around 16% to 17% of revenue. Looking at our capital allocation for 2017, you can see that over half of the investment will still be used to maintain infrastructure to help ensure a safe and reliable network. In addition, our 2017 equipment investment is down significantly from the prior year due to the completion of our locomotive purchase commitment. A major shift in our 2017 capital plan from last year is the significant increase in strategic investments which support improved service, long-term growth and efficiency initiatives under the CSX of Tomorrow strategy. Finally, looking at our investment in Positive Train Control, we have invested $1.8 billion through the end of 2016 and we plan to invest about $270 million in 2017. CSX is on track to meet the legislative timeline for PTC. As we look at the path to achieving this goal, we now believe the total cost of PTC implementation will be about $2.4 billion before any third-party recoveries. Now, let me wrap up on the next slide. Overall CSX has delivered solid financial performance in 2016 despite a dynamic freight environment that impacted nearly every market. This success was driven by pricing for the relative value of our service, driving record efficiency gains, and aligning resources to the softer demand environment which partially offset the 5% decline in total volume. To mitigate the soft demand, we took significant action resulting in efficiency savings of nearly $430 million and rightsizing savings of about $175 million. Primarily as a result of these actions, CSX was able to improve its full-year operating ratio by 30 basis points to 69.4%. Looking ahead, while we still face some specific market challenges from a strong U.S. dollar and low commodity prices, we expect overall conditions for the freight environment to be healthier in 2017. As a result, we expect the combination of merchandise and intermodal to grow in 2017 on a comparable 52-week basis in line with the economy. As I mentioned previously, domestic coal tonnage is expected to decline again in 2017 on a comparable basis, primarily due to a shortfall competitive loss. Excluding this 6 million ton loss we expect domestic coal tonnage to be roughly flat despite low natural gas prices that continue to challenge the competitiveness of Eastern utility coal. We continue to see favorable near-term market conditions for export coal and expect mid-to-high 20 million tons for this year. We remain intensely focused on delivering a service product that meets or exceeds our customers' expectations, achieving strong pricing to support reinvestment in the business and driving efficiencies across our entire cost structure. Again, we are targeting productivity savings of more than $150 million in 2017. With CSX's continued focus on strong pricing and cost control, coupled with a stabilizing industrial economy and more moderate energy declines, we currently expect EPS growth in the low-to-mid-teens for the first quarter. For the full-year, we also expect overall EPS growth in 2017. Of course growth will be stronger in the first half as we cycle our two more challenging quarters from 2016, but we will keep you informed on a quarterly basis as we progress through the year. Finally, we are reducing our capital investment by nearly $500 million to $2.2 billion. In combination with the higher earnings, CSX will also improve overall free cash flow in 2017 for shareholders. With that let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks. Michael Ward : Well, thank you, Frank. In the year where the industry faced sustained low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar that had broad based market impacts, CSX lost another $470 million in coal revenue and experienced declines in nearly every other market. Faced with these challenging business conditions, the company generated strong financial results driven by decisive actions to produce an all-time record of nearly $430 million of efficiency gains. Our performance underscores this teams' ability to rapidly adapt to changing economic conditions and the restructuring of the energy markets. Looking forward, the CSX of Tomorrow strategy drives growth in the more service sensitive merchandise and intermodal businesses. We will achieve this by emphasizing reliable and cost-effective service, realigning our far-reaching network, and deploying additional technology solutions to further improve safety, efficiency, and service. In addition, the more favorable economic conditions overall, and the prospects for more balanced regulation, coupled with the quality of our network, our team, and our strategy, lead us to expect full-year earnings per share growth in 2017 despite the overhang of the strong dollar and low global commodity prices. Longer-term as we continue the company's transformation we remain committed to achieving a mid-60s operating ratio. And with that, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Christian Wetherbee with Citigroup. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Hi, Christian. Christian Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about the 2017 volume outlook. Frank, I know you mentioned I think merchandise and intermodal growth in line with the broader economy and you've talked a lot about coal, so that's helpful. But could you give us some sense about how you're looking at the broader economy and maybe what are some of the puts and takes as you think about that merchandise and intermodal business for the full year of 2017? Fredrik Eliasson : Sure. This is Fredrik. I would say that if we look at our merchandise business, we feel pretty good now across the board in terms of being able to produce growth across essentially all of those markets, and as I said in line with overall -- overall economy. We've seen the economy obviously go through a pretty tough time here on the industrial side in 2016. But as we move into 2017, I think we see a little bit, obviously each year comes, but also little bit momentum here. And so we feel good about what we're seeing on the merchandise side. On the -- in the national side on the intermodal side, we are done cycling some of the losses that impacted us in 2016 and that will be helpful. And then on the domestic side, we continue to see the vibrancy that we've seen over the last decade or so being able to grow that market well above whatever the economy produces. So if you add those pieces up, I do think on the merchandise intermodal side that we will be able to grow in line with whatever the economy is going to produce and hopefully it will get little bit of the tailwind that we're feeling right now to continue, may be even little bit better than that. But we'll see where we end up and we'll keep you informed throughout the year. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. Okay, that's helpful; I appreciate it. And then just wanted to touch on the 2017 outlook for the operating ratio. So great movement on efficiency savings in 2016; you have a target for 150-plus for 2017. How do we think about that in terms of the operating ratio? How much progress do you think you might be able to make this year? Frank Lonegro : Hi Christian, it's Frank. We should be able to make good progress there. The challenge that we're going to have obviously is when you look at the numbers that we have on a reported basis there are things in there obviously that need to be pulled out in order for us to really look on a comparable basis. So you saw a two year run sub-70% but each of those years had something in there that helped on the operating ratio side. So we're doing everything we can on the operating ratio certainly on the cost side, you're going to hear from Cindy that she'll do everything she can to pull productivity, Fredrik is going to continue to rely on that improved service product to drive pricing from the top-line side, you see an improving volume environment. And so with less coal declines that certainly sets us up for a positive 2017. How much progress we make obviously we will give you some transparency as we get through the first quarter and get it before we know how long coal is going to help us. Christian Wetherbee : But is the sub-70% OR sort of the target for this year? Frank Lonegro : Well, we haven't really given any OR guidance, it certainly isn't lost on us but we'd like to go three years in a row with it and get it on a -- I'd say a more core basis obviously there has been help for last two years and so it's certainly something that we have our eyes set on. Operator : Your next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Tom. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. I apologize for any background noise here; I'm in the midst of some travel. But wanted to see if you could comment on the driver of the labor cost savings that ramped up nicely; I think it was $76 million fourth quarter versus $53 million in third. And so, as that -- your total productivity savings for 2017 is quite a bit lower than the big number you achieved in 2016, but the labor is ramping sequentially. So what -- could that labor savings continue to ramp or how do you think about that? And may be if you can relate that to additions of sightings and longer trains. Thank you. Cindy Sanborn : Sure. This is Cindy. So in terms of labor savings as you referenced at the fourth quarter specifically, we did see some benefit in volume that we did not have to add headcount back one for one and we expect to see that type of impact volume increasing environment. So what we have seen the past six quarters or so, is volume going down and product and we take -- we right sized a number of expenses specifically with headcount as one of them to reduce our expense. But we've also taken out expense and headcount through structural changes that we've -- that you've heard us talk about as well. So you think about the structural changes going forward, you reference the sighting capacity and as you talked about that in the past we have to make some investments to continue to drive train length and that is true. We expect to invest in 2017 and 2018 to drive that; we should see some benefits of that in 2018 that you'll actually see in headcount from structural change on train length now. Having said that, we're always looking for opportunities to improve our expense control whether it's headcount, whether it's fuel, and other areas and we'll continue to do that and certainly with in mind of protecting service for our customers at the same time. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great and one for Fredrik, I think we've certainly you can see how the benchmark export coal prices, clean blend, or the API 2 in Europe have gone up. Can you frame for us a bit the magnitude of the benefit on your pricing for export coal in fourth quarter and if it's how much percentagewise they went up or revenue or any kind of broad frame and then do you think that will be a similar impact in first quarter or a stronger benefit in first quarter on export coal pricing. Thank you. Fredrik Eliasson : Yes. Sure Tom. First of all, we really don't forecast price. Now I think you know that since 2012 when we saw the peak of the market has been coming down, we've been pretty public about the fact that we've both obviously want to continue to optimize the bottom-line for us, but also strategically do what we can in partnership with the producers to stay keeping investors in a very difficult time, which we're obviously going through. Now clearly the market has come back here a lot faster than a lot of people had thought and certainly we expect the same sort of partnership on the way up as we saw on the way down, there are other factors that come into play than just index themselves. There is a spread between different types of quality of coal. There is also the fact that there is, well the benchmark has going up significantly in first quarter. The spot market is a very different place. So there's a variety of things that comes into play but overall that partnership that I think we've established over the last few years, we certainly expect it to go both ways. Tom Wadewitz : So you think there is more sequential benefit in first quarter or similar or you just don't care to comment on that? Fredrik Eliasson : I don't -- we don't forecast price but I think we've given you the philosophy of how to look at things. I think that pretty much all the visibility, we will -- we can give you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Danny Schuster : Hey, good morning, this is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thanks for taking our question. Michael Ward : Hi, Danny. Danny Schuster : We are hoping to dig in a little bit more on CapEx. So, Frank, you mentioned today that the strategic investments are stepping up a little bit this year and I know over the last decade or so you spent around 10% to 15% of your CapEx on commercial facilities. So could you just provide us with a little bit more color on what's in the strategic investment bucket and whether we should expect this level of investment in that bucket to be sustained over the next few years. Frank Lonegro : Sure. I think to answer the last part of your question around sustained investment in the strategic at roughly the percentage that you're seeing in 2017, over the next planning horizon, I think the answer to that is yes, that is very much aligned with our CSX of Tomorrow strategy. As part of that there is certainly investments in intermodal facilities you've already heard us talk about Pittsburgh that we'll complete about halfway through this year and then you've also heard us talk about the Central Carolina Connector the big hub that we're going outside of Rocky Mount to serve the Mid Atlantic and the Southeast. So you'll see us continue to invest in facilities like that to expand the terminal footprint and be able to expand the existing terminal footprint to be able to handle the increase in domestic business -- that domestic intermodal business that we believe is a big part of the growth story for us longer-term. Danny Schuster : Great, thank you. Frank Lonegro : So the other things I ought to add in there, Danny, is when you think about what's in the CSX of Tomorrow investments that you're seeing in that increase to say 25-ish-percent of the portfolio is also all of the network investments and the technology investments that we're looking to make to support, train length and fluidity and long-term growth as well as efficiency and better service for our customers. Danny Schuster : Okay, okay that makes a lot of sense. And then we were just hoping would you be able to provide us with a little bit more color on the buckets of the efficiency that you're targeting this year. So is there a rough split you could provide us between what you expect in labor and fringe MS&O and the fuel. Frank Lonegro : I think Cindy and I will tag team this one. I think what you'll find is that generally speaking; the productivity will follow the relative allocation in our cost bucket. So probably more so on the labor side, which is roughly 50-ish-percent of our cost base and then fuel and MS&O will be important, but lesser parts of that and then really it's across the board approach on cost it's certainly, given the size of the operating cost that we have, it's a lot of that falls on Cindy's shoulders but the G&A side also pulls its way to an offsetting inflation every year as well, Cindy. Cindy Sanborn : Yes, I would say, Frank summed it up, if there is no one area specifically that you're going to see outsized productivity, it's going to be across the board. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning. Amit Mehrotra : Great. Good morning, thanks for taking the question. So I had a question on mix and margins. Over the last couple years, it's clear that the mix of the business has changed pretty dramatically and you and the rest of the industry have adjusted remarkably well to that. But maybe as we enter a relatively more stable mix environment; maybe see some potential disproportionate growth on intermodal, just wondering how this impacts contribution margins. Could we see structurally higher incrementals in that environment, given the progress you guys have made on the productivity and pricing front? Just help us think about the moving parts there, maybe in a more stable and a controlled environment volume environment. Thanks. Frank Lonegro : Let me hit the incremental piece and then Fredrik will hit the volume piece. Clearly when business comes back in the scheduled network, whether that's intermodal or we call classed merchandise traffic that set up well given all the productivity efforts that Cindy and her team have done as well as the pricing efforts that Fredrik and his team have done. So what you're seeing is a good setup for incremental margins in those growth areas, when things come back in more the both network things that move in unit train quantities and we're going to add cost in order to handle that business. Fredrik Eliasson : Yes and similarly what Cindy says in terms of never done, I think we have never done trying to grow the bottom-line whether that's through price, volume or helping Cindy drive productivity gains. I do think that as you look forward the next couple of years and hopefully you are right that we will have a more stable environment especially if we refer to coal, but I do think also that the growth opportunities that we're seeing a lot of that is in domestic intermodal and it's going to have the higher rate or higher volume growth than you would see in some of the other markets. So you will have a continued mix impact on the top-line but it doesn't always transit is bad thing from a bottom-line perspective because a lot of that growth is going to come into fixed and fixed network where we do have a fair amount of opportunities also to drive train length, we have double-stack clearance and we just obviously we didn't have in the tunnel, a fair amount of automation products as well. So well there is a revenue negative mix, so to speak, it doesn't necessarily mean that is a negative mix from a bottom-line. Amit Mehrotra : If I can just follow-up one quickly on that, I mean it looks like, in the fourth quarter at least; the incremental EBIT margin was around 38%. But that did include some higher stock comp expense, maybe $30 million or so, above what you were originally predicting. So if you adjust for that, it looks like on an operating basis maybe it was closer to 50%. Would that be kind of the conversion you would expect on any revenue growth, at least in 2017 in the midterm around that 50% level? Frank Lonegro : I think you're normalizing the fourth quarter in the way that we are as well when we are answering your question about incremental margins in the fourth quarter. Obviously you didn't see the flow-through that you would otherwise have looked for but I think there are some discrete parts in there that once you back those out then you're in the right neighborhood. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Let me ask one quick one, if I could, on taxes. I know it's probably a hard question to answer, but obviously this has the potential I guess to be a significant positive to the bottom-line. So you can't answer, obviously, what's going to happen, but if you do get some tailwind on the corporate tax rate, how do you think this plays out? I mean, do you think it gets competed away? How much do you think the keys to the Company? And then I think you have a pretty sizable deferred tax liability that would, I would imagine, get revalued down. And so just trying to understand if you would change any capital allocation decisions given the leverage would look probably better, at least on a book capital basis. Thank you. Frank Lonegro : Sure. So in the tax proposals, obviously there are going to be moving parts in terms of what is the ultimate rate that applies to corporations as well as how bonus depreciation is going to be handled as well as the expensing of interest. So if you just go all of that through the model and think through what is that imply from a cash flow perspective, it's certainly positive from a free cash flow perspective, we would have to revalue the deferred tax liabilities. But that would be sort of more of a one-time hit as we reset the EPS number based on that that revaluation. In terms of use of cash obviously, we would continue to apply a balanced approach to capital deployment. We would look hard at capital investments that might be able to; to be pulled forward and certainly we would look at the shareholder return aspects of dividends and buybacks as well. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Ravi. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So question on merchandise intermodal pricing; that remains above 3% but has been decelerating a bit for the last few quarters. When do you expect an inflection there? Do you need those markets to come back strongly or do you expect that to react to inflation? Also, if you can share your inflation expectations for 2017, that would be great. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure. So I will just remind again, we really don't forecast pricing, it obviously has been a tough period, an extended period now from a pricing perspective and lot of excess capacity out there and our challenge to our team is of course to sell through this trough, make sure we sell the improved service product that we have, the unparalled network access that we have and provide innovative solutions to our customers and I think the fact that we, we've been able to do as well as we have I think is a good testament to both the fact that, it isn't value driver of ours and it is also a good testament to the fact that we really do need to make sure to continue to value price to be able to reinvest in the business the way we want to. And so it has been a sequential downtick. We'll see when it when it turns, I think there's a lot of good things going on as the economy picks up. I think is good thing if we continue to low unemployment that put pressure on the wages. We know that. We see the deal demand is coming into play here as we get into the second half of 2017. So I think things are lining up for better pricing environment as move through the second half of 2017 but it might not fully be where we want to be until we get to 2018. Frank Lonegro : Ravi on your inflation question I think in the prepared remarks, you heard the $35 million inflation on labor and fringe and there are some pretty key industry drivers as part of that, it's not really on the wage side of things, it's on health and welfare side so medical inflation obviously there's always going to be a little bit, little bit higher than we would like. And then when you think about how we fund the Union side healthcare through an industry trust, we had a surplus in the trust or a couple of years and with all of the headcount reductions that the industry has made with that surplus has been a really evaporated. And as you also know as furloughed employees go off of the payroll that you get four month of incremental health and welfare coverage that again has the hit to the trust and then fewer employees across the industry, which means you can spread the catastrophic losses over as many people. So I'd say those are the big drivers on that one, if you were looking for inflation on MS&O and rent I think I would give you, just your sequential run rate from Q4. If you have those in your model for the first quarter and probably throughout the year, you'd be pretty close. And then I think we've given you some guidance on interest and depreciation as well so that\u2019s probably the full wrap on that one. Ravi Shanker : Very helpful. So just wanted to confirm that you expect pricing above inflation for 2017? Fredrik Eliasson : I said we don't -- we don't forecast price, we expect strong pricing. All our customers have options and we're going to make sure we price to market. But I think our result speaks to itself in terms of trying to find that interplay between where the customer feels we provide a great service product. And at the same time allows us to reinvest in the business. Ravi Shanker : Got it. And just one follow-up for Frank. When you said the -- you expect the near-term market conditions for coal to remain favorable, what do you mean by near-term? Is that 2017; is that first half, first quarter? Can you just help define that? Michael Ward : Can you repeat that question please? Ravi Shanker : I think Frank said in his comments that he expects the near-term market conditions for coal to remain favorable. Just wanted to get a sense of what near term means. Fredrik Eliasson : Well, I mean, I think our -- what we've done on the coal side just to reiterate some of the things that Frank said, our view is that as we think about coal for the first quarter we said 15 to 16 million tons for coal on the domestic side. And on the export side about similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter about 8 million tons. And for the full year, we said we will essentially be flat if it wasn't for the competitive loss, so and that is about as stable rate throughout the 2017 year. Michael Ward : And that's for the year. Fredrik Eliasson : On the domestic side. And export for the year, mid to the high 20s. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning Ken. Ken Hoexter : Hey, good morning, Michael. Just, Michael, maybe for you on CSX of Tomorrow, maybe you could help define it. How do you define it? Is this a CapEx program or new network build plan like National Gateway? Is this a CapEx plan that you're going to target? Maybe you can delve into that a little bit. Michael Ward : Yes, what its mostly dimensional Ken, obviously it's building at the intermodal network as Frank's discussed earlier. It's also looking at our network, we've done some of this, where we deemphasize some of the investment in the less dense lines and we're putting investments in sidings to allow us to run longer trains to some of those key corridors, our primary corridors. But in addition, we're really working on involving more technology deployment to automate things to make them more safe and so it's really reforming to looking at the opportunities we have are really in the intermodal and the merchandise and we're reshaping the network with that strategic capital to allow us to capitalize on that, so increasing the train length and service reliability on the primary routes, deemphasizing some of the local, but still keeping it safe and high service and investing in intermodal and technology. Ken Hoexter : Great. And then on -- maybe Frank; have you started to return some of the furloughed employees? I guess when you take your efficiency gains, should we, literally, be taking the $450 million -- or $420 million last year, the $150 million you're looking at and that's your -- you add $0.11 from that into earnings and that was offset by coal this year? Just want to understand how we should put those numbers that you give on the efficiency gains into our thought process for actual cost savings. Frank Lonegro : Let me take high level and then Cindy will talk about the furloughed employees. When you look at us on a year-over-year basis, you really have to remember that we lost nearly $470 million of coal revenue. So that was a huge impact both from a top-line and the bottom-line perspective. And you look at what we did both on the pricing side and the record productivity that we gain, that's the big story that you see in 2016 on a year-over-year basis. The furlough count is really something that Cindy keeps an eye on as we look at headcount which was down on a sequential basis and down I think about 3,000 on the year-over-year basis, Q4 against Q4. We're going to continue to look at that. We guided to headcount being down slightly sequentially as you think about the first quarter but that's some that Cindy is clearly focused on and making sure we have both enough resources to handle the expected demand but also that we're doing on efficient basis. Cindy Sanborn : Yes on a furlough employee's piece, we got about 1,950 people furloughed right now and it's really location by location and still needing to recall, we do recall for attrition, we do seeing normal attrition. We are going to be training some locomotive engineers because that's where we see the most attrition this year. But we will pull people back as we need to and if we end up getting to a place where we don't have furloughed at a specific location, we will try to move people that are furloughed to other locations and then as necessary we will have to hire to tech service. But we look at this closely and it's really hard to be very general about what we recall because some of attrition and then we furloughed some other areas at the same time. So it's we keep a very close tabs on it and we also do so to keep our employees informed too. We want to know when they're going to return back to work. Ken Hoexter : So just to clarify Fred's answer there then, even with volumes inflecting and coming back, you're still expecting -- I just want to clarify -- you're still expecting employees to be down on an absolute basis? Cindy Sanborn : Yes I think when we Fredrik talked about it little bit, when we see volumes coming back in our scheduled network, we have opportunities to add additional cars to trains without adding additional locomotives or people associated with that on a unit train basis, if it were to come back there we may see a little bit more that we need to pull back. But we look at it based on how we see volumes come, where we see volume coming and in what form and then appropriately handle it. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Brandon. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning, Michael, and thanks for getting me on the call here. I want to come back to Ken's question on the CSX of Tomorrow, because I think your investors have heard snippets of what this new strategy is. But, first off, does it include a mid-60%s OR target? And then we've been talking about that target since 2011, so about six years now, and we're just scratching the surface of sub-70%. But when I think about some of the headwinds that have been in place the last six years with coal coming down, a lot of mix erosion in your business, doesn't 2017 set up to be a big potential year to show that OR expansion in the business? Because finally we have coal close to flat; you have gotten a lot of efficiency in the network. Isn't this where we can really see the potential of the CSX network? And why not, if that's not the case this year? Michael Ward : So Brandon yes we still are targeting the mid-60s operating ratio longer-term and you're quite right. We've had that out there for a number of years and we've lost about $2 billion worth of some of our most profitable business during that process. So obviously that delays us giving there is quickly. I mean we love to have that $2 billion back and will be easily in the mid-60s, but that's not reality anymore. So we're going to continue to march, we are not going to predict what the operating ratio will be for 2017, as Frank alluded to, we will continue to keep you posted as the year goes on but we are not going to make a prediction on OR for this year. Brandon Oglenski : I mean, Michael, is this just a case that it's really not an absolute cost opportunity in the networks? You feel that costs are structurally where they need to be and it's hard to get costs lower; so therefore, we need a lot of revenue expansion on the top-line to get that mid-60%s OR? Michael Ward : No, we're going to continue to pursue cost reductions. I mean, while we did this year, I think was extraordinary but Cindy and her team and the G&A groups are not going to be relentless in taking cost out. We're certainly going to get at least $150 million this year, obviously we'll strive for more, but as we think about going to that mid-50s operating ratio is going to be a combination of efficiency, volume, and pricing to the value we create for our customers, all three of those levers going to be deployed to achieve that goal. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Brian. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey good morning, thanks for getting me on the call. Fredrik, if you can just talk about the competitive loss on coal that you mentioned. Was that modal on price or was it something related to how utilities are sourcing some of their volumes in the New Year? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, it was a competitive loss that we believe we lost another railroad; it was relatively short haul, a very short haul business. So I think the tonnage is a little bit more severe than potential the bottom-line impact on it. And that happens. There is business changing hands between us and other railroads on a continuous basis and this one is a little bigger than normal, which is why we highlighted it. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. And as you think of just pricing and coal in general, and the point-to-point was -- I think it's expected to roll out starting this year, how has that been received in your discussions with customers? And your guidance for volume for the full year, do you expect any of this point-to-point pricing to actually impact your volumes negatively or positively? Fredrik Eliasson : No, I think the point-to-point price is something structurally that we need to do to make sure that it was more in line with the work that was being done up there and it was -- it was -- it was time to change the way -- the way from kind of these rate district that we had before and it really doesn't impact I think in anyway should perform the amount of volume that we're going to be moving here in 2017. And I think we also have a lot of contracts that are out there but we haven't been able to implemented in yet but over time we will try to get into all of our -- all of our business -- Michael Ward : We have it in the tariffs. Fredrik Eliasson : We have it in the tariffs but we haven't been able to touch in all in contracts yet so. It's something that we are doing to the network and through to make sure that is more reflective of the marketplace and the work that is actually being done out there. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Sorry, one quick follow-up. It sounds like, just to confirm, we probably shouldn't expect much more rationalization in the coal network this year. Is that correct? Cindy Sanborn : Brian this is Cindy. We are always looking. I think as we think about transforming our network and network of tomorrow that's something we look at, but to further good point we are going to make sure we serve the customers that are able to load, so efficiently and effectively and where we can make further reductions we will, we think coal, over time, we'll continue to shift and close working relationship between Fredrik and I will be there with structural changes that are appropriate for the time. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Bask. Bascome Majors : Good morning. I know we're going to see plenty of detail in your proxy in the spring, but I was hoping that you guys could share how the Board has adjusted senior management's longer-term financial incentives to better align with the CSX of Tomorrow strategy. Michael Ward : They have there is two years ago. I think what we did is we changed, we used to have a major driver of our long-term -- let me go backwards, our short-term incentive compensation is based on operating income as well as that's about 60% of the bonus opportunity with a minimum amount and then 40% is based on safety, service, and strategic type initiatives. On the long-term incentive plan we for many years, we're strictly operating ratio we now are on the performance piece of blend of operating ratio and return on assets because they thought we really need to focus more on deploying the assets in an appropriate manner that's one of the reasons, besides the change in the marketplace that you're seeing more of our capital going towards strategic initiatives is to increase that overall return on assets. So they're trying to incent us to make sure that where we're really focused on getting a great return on the investments we make. Obviously, we've always have got some amount of our investments, with capital investments we make or to keep the railroad in good shape, keep it safe and keep it running well. That's going to be 50% or more over time but more and more we're going to push towards strategic investments. Bascome Majors : I appreciate that color. So it sounds like the changes that we saw last year -- we're not going to see significant changes this year; that was kind of the shift? Michael Ward : That's correct, yes. One of things when you think about long-term incentive programs Bascome, if you change them too much too often, the employees lose the focus of what is important. So I think the board wanted to keep some continuity and that the return on assets is still an appropriate focus as well as OR. Frank Lonegro : Bascome it's Frank. I think one of the things you'll see within the annual cycle that Michael talked about where we do have a portion of the incentive opportunity against strategic goals, you will see us making sure that the things we're doing it in a given year to execute on that strategy will be part of the things that we're incented to accomplish. Bascome Majors : I appreciate all that detail there. And just very high level, it sounds like you may have accrued above plan for 2016. Should we think of incentive comp as a tailwind if we're at plan for 2017 and --? Thank you; I'll drop off. Frank Lonegro : Bascome thanks. Good question. Yes, you did see us take incentive comp up in the fourth quarter which is one of the misses, I think that several folks had when you look at it on an annual basis, it resets. I think if you're looking for tailwind, if we hit plan in 2017, it's going to be much more back-end loaded than impact in the first half. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Scott. Scott Group : Hey thanks. Good morning guys. So wanted to ask, first, just about the overall yields. We saw nice yield growth in the fourth quarter : mix was positive; coal yields up a lot. Are you assuming, Frank, in the first-quarter guidance, a deceleration in that yield growth and mix benefit? Because it feels like you kind of need to assume a mix -- a yield deceleration to get to the earnings numbers you're talking about. Frank Lonegro : Well let me Fredrik and I will tag team this one. But I think what you're seeing is in the first quarter as you look at the guidance that we have out there for coal, you're seeing two things happen, you're seeing the impact on the domestic side of the competitive loss but you're seeing sequential stability and therefore year-over-year increase in the export coal. So you got to take that into the mix equation. And then in terms of the other growth that we mentioned in terms of merchandise intermodal growing in line with the economy, we should see nice incremental margins associated with that. So I don't know that I see any specific mix change that you're mentioning there as we about the first quarter. Scott Group : I guess I was just thinking like just from an overall -- maybe I asked it poorly. But just from an overall yield growth perspective -- well, to the 4% in the fourth quarter, are you assuming a deceleration from that in the first quarter guidance? Fredrik Eliasson : Well this is Fredrik. I say that again we don't forecast price and clearly this is a combination of both our same-store sales number and the mix of the business for that given quarter. And so we'll give you transparency at the end in terms of how much was price and how much was mix and so that's, I think that's all the sort of insight we can provide you. Frank Lonegro : What we try to do was to give you a blended view Scott in the way that we talked about low-to-mid-teens on EPS growth. And obviously that's going to be a combination of things. It's going to be the top-line, it's going to be the expense line, it's going to be a couple of things below line is going to be share count and when you blend all of those things together, you can get to the numbers that we're talking about. Scott Group : Okay, that makes sense. On the -- so we started to see a little bit of slippage in some of the train speeds and service metrics. Are we at a point where we need to start thinking about bringing back people or broadly bringing back costs at a faster rate, or are you still very comfortable with where service is where we don't need to contemplate that yet? Cindy Sanborn : Yes, Scott. I think where we are -- I think we are stable, when you look at network performance and when we break it down into our customer see it in the customer facing view our service sensitive business, intermodal automotive is running extremely well. First Mile Last Mile service is also running extremely well. So Fredrik and I are very, very comfortable with where we have service and there is always room to improve, don't get me wrong. And as you look across some of the different measurements there are opportunities there. I don't see resource adds as a lever that needs to be pulled relative to the measurements, you're looking at. I mean you can get into velocity and it's kind of a mix issue when you think about the growth we have seen in the fourth quarter in colo and grains. Those are little bit slower speed services than the other. So there's a little bit of mix there but we keep our eye on it. We make sure we're looking at payable days per load and other measures that we're still being very efficient and when we need to bring back resources we absolutely will. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you. If I can just ask one, last one for Frank on CapEx. So I think the $2.2 billion in my model is closer to 19% of revenue. I thought you said 16% or 17% of revenue. I guess I'm just surprised that it's not coming down more, if you I think 2016 you had $300 million of catch-up from 2015 and then you pulled forward $300 million from 2017 into 2016. So I would have thought it would have been down, I know $800 million or $900 million but maybe I'm missing something there? Frank Lonegro : Yes so when we calculate the percentage of revenue and we give you that guidance, we do what we call it core basis. In other words the PTC expense or the PTC CapEx is an overlay because at some point in time it's going to go way and it's really going to be just part of the -- the replacement cycle that we have on our assets. In terms of the year-over-year, you're right there was about $600 million in the $2.7 billion for 2016 which was locomotive specific, some of that was deferred from 2015 and some of that was foregoing with seller financing to push it into 2017. So you do have that impact. And I think the biggest driver that you have there is really looking at the inflection of the strategic investment towards the CSX of Tomorrow and that's where you're seeing in on a categorical basis anyway the increase we are being very judicious in terms of how we're investing in the infrastructure. We're looking very hard at equipment and obviously the longer we can go without buying new locomotives based on all the work you have been doing and all the locomotives that we have taken delivery up in the last couple of years should help us down that path. But you are going to see us on a sustained basis through this planning cycle, make sure that we are transforming this company and transforming the network into what we need long-term. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Jay. Jason Seidl : Thank you. Good morning, guys. I want to focus the first question here on the CSX of Tomorrow and talk about headcount a little bit. Now your headcount has come down drastically, and I don't want to underplay the real-life impacts that has on some people, but looking out, as you guys have adjusted your network and as new technologies come into play, where do you see the headcount going on the railroad? Cindy Sanborn : I think this is a great question and when we think about some of the structural changes that we've made in train length and in the investments that we're making in sidings on the route from Chicago to Jacksonville allow us to further enhance those efficiencies and reduced headcount. Another big piece of it the CSX of Tomorrow with the highly automated railroad components around technology deployment. And when I think about that, there are several ways to break that down into predictive analytics which makes us more reliable and more efficient with repairs that we need to make. Automated inspections even machine vision we have some of that deployed in our intermodal business now and looking in some other areas where we can deploy that. And then also when I think about mobility and being able to interact in a more for employees interact globally as opposed to having be to fixed location as well as our customers being able to benefit from mobility technology. So those investments as we make them and they come in, we should see additional reductions in headcount while still maintaining safety and service to our customers. Frank Lonegro : Jason one other piece of color, I will give you on that, it's Frank is within the guidance that we gave you on headcount, so for example, down slightly on a sequential basis, you would actually if you look at the details, see some uptick in technology hiring as we do things necessary to support highly automated railroad down the road. Jason Seidl : Okay guys. That's great color. I guess the next one is going to probably bump back to Fredrik, let me ask this a different way. I know you guys aren't going to forecast pricing but given what you know about the current market and sort of the outlook for truck competition, which I think everyone just assumes will naturally tighten as we get closer to the LD mandate, would you be surprised to see CSX pricing below rail inflation anytime this year? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes we try to stay away from pinpointing exactly rail inflation because first of all rail has been very low over the last couple of years. So clearly, we like to be above that. We think long-term; we have a lot of inflationary pressures that doesn't seem to be working out consistent with what the rail inflation numbers is. We have set 3%, 3.5% is what our rail inflation has been and probably will continue to be depending on what happens with the labor negotiations but hopefully will be lower as we move forward. But overall, I think the key thing for us is to make sure that we continue to deliver excellent service to our customers, provide innovative solutions, and find a sweet spot where we can also reinvest in the business. And I think you know that pricing is a key value driver for us and it will continue to be as we move forward and where that's going to fall out is depending on where the economy is, where the capacity utilization is we will get, we have to price the market and the market changes from time to time. And as you can see our pricing and if the market tightens that give us an opportunity to capitalize on that as we move forward. Jason Seidl : Well, I tried; can't blame me. Guys, I appreciate the time, as always. Michael Ward : Good try, Jason. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Cherilyn. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. So productivity clearly a highlight of 2016, can you talk about how much of the $430 million was structural and give us some color on where you manage to find opportunities to exceed the target that was updated as recently as Q3? Cindy Sanborn : Good morning, Cherilyn. Thanks. Yes so when you look at 2016, think of productivity of the $430 million and above in two -- in three buckets. The first bucket about $100 million was structural that was primarily in the coalfields but we did also find some structural changes we can make in our merchandise areas. Then when I look at the next bucket of about $150 million, it was in train length and being able to be more efficient it's structural in nature, but to be able to be more efficient with train size and other initiatives along those lines. And then the last $150 million, if you will, would be about relative to traditional productivity and initiative based type actions that we're going to take including technology and other enhancements and probably that's a little bit higher than $150 million to get to the $430 million. You asked a question about the fourth quarter, specifically. Could you re-ask that one again to make sure I got that right? Cherilyn Radbourne : Well if I memory serves, the productivity target as of Q3 was $400 million, so to finish up with $430 million is kind of nice performance relative to that most recent targets. Cindy Sanborn : Yes I think there as we were coming into fourth quarter, we actually were able to enjoy some volume that we did not have to replace one for one on in terms of any resources, we did actually pull out some locomotives out of storage in the fourth quarter but the volume helped us be able to continue to perform with productivity. Cherilyn Radbourne : Great. And then just a quick one on the revenue side. I'd be curious about your thoughts on the new shipping alliances due to start up this spring. Does that impact visibility on the international intermodal side at all? Fredrik Eliasson : We obviously follow very closely what is going on right now in the steamship line business, it is -- it is a very difficult time the lot of realignment. We do have our customers that we are aligned to very fortunate that most of them are very strong. But we will see how this plays out there is additional rumors out there, but it's variety of different potential transactions and as they fold out -- as they're developing we will have a better sense of what the impact is on CSX. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. You may ask your question. David Vernon : Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the time. First question is around the moderation or deceleration in earnings growth towards the back half, is that just the lapping of some of the productivity in the train length initiatives or is there something else going on there in the cost side that we should be we thinking about? Frank Lonegro : I think it's simply the costs that we have, when you look at the quarterly EPS from 2016 and you think about how that would normally adjust throughout the year. That's really what we said. But obviously we're going to give you; we gave you good guidance on Q1. And as we did throughout 2016 given the dynamic environment that we're in, we are going to keep you updated and obviously if we can update those numbers for you as we get through the quarter we will do that. David Vernon : All right. And then maybe just thinking longer term, obviously, the -- I'm just wondering if you guys are thinking any more optimistically about the possibility of moving from two- to one-man crews in some of the operations. And if you've done any work to scope out what it would cost to implement that and what some of the benefits could be, or if maybe it's just still too early on the regulatory front. Michael Ward : Well clearly as you look out technology is evolving David, there is going to be autonomous vehicles out there. There is no question, the only question is when and how much they will be deployed. And if you think about us putting the Positive Train Control system in place, which we will have in place as required by law. One does have to question why there needs to be two people on the crew when you have that kind of safety overlay in there. So over time, I think that will be an issue. I don't think it's in the near-term, but longer-term, that's certainly something we're going to have to address. Frank Lonegro : And David from a model parity think about sort of policy perspective here and you think about the dollars that are being provided into the autonomous vehicle space whether it's governmental or private investment, I mean we're looking for that same concept to prevail as Washington re-looks at policy decisions going forward. David Vernon : Yes, that's kind of the heart of what I'm trying to get at. When you think about a modal competition standpoint and intermodal, obviously truck price will get a huge benefit from autonomous vehicles. I'm just wondering if you think you can offset that in the same way or if you think there is some sort of longer-term disadvantage that may accrue from that. Fredrik Eliasson : I think it's something obviously will have to be negotiated with our Unions that will be a challenge -- challenging negotiation. But I think if you look inevitably as the competition dictates the need to do that and there is a safety overlay called PTC in place, we have to make sure that the public is protected. I think it's inevitable; it is just a question of when. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Jeff. Operator : One moment please and Jeff your line is open. You may ask your question. Jeff Kauffman : Okay, thanks. Good morning, Mike. How are you? Michael Ward : Jeff, thank you. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you. Congratulations. A lot of my questions have been asked, so I want to kind of circle back to coal and how that mix is going to move around a little bit. With nat gas up where it is, we are getting a lot closer to Eastern coal being in the money. I know you mentioned the utility short-haul loss. So when I sort all through it, we've got some met coal that's coming online and that should be more favorable, despite some of the international prices retreating. Outside of the utility customer loss, it feels like utility coal inventory is coming down, shaping up a little bit, and it feels like there should be a positive mix effect in coal, because you're losing some short-haul business, you're gaining some met. Can you talk about how you're seeing the coal business? And normally, you guys give an idea of where customer utilities are, so your northern region versus your southern region. Just kind of update us on how to think about the yields in the mix and where the inventory levels are in your service area. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure Jeff. There's a couple of different questions in your question but let me see if I can address most of them. So as we -- I've seen here over the last couple of months, the summer months were very hard and allowed for a beginning of drawdown of some very high inventory levels. And as we look at them right now, they are down significantly year-over-year probably slightly above target both in the North and in the South but have made significant progress over the last few months. So that is helpful. In terms of natural gas prices, you're right we're seeing significantly higher than what we saw last year. So that's a good thing. We, I think we've said publicly many times that we need about 350 or so for the first half of our portfolio to be in the money that that is being sourced from Illinois Basin and Western Sources and so we're getting, we are pretty close to that and utilities are making rational economic decision on a daily basis in terms of which utilities they are going to dispatch and we're seeing the impact of that year-over-year. We got off to pretty cold winter in December, it has moderated here the first few weeks in January, but based on the preliminary numbers that we have seen so far this year, we are being dispatched little bit higher than we were last year which I think is a reflection of the natural gas prices. So we do feel much, much better than what we felt going into previous years about our coal businesses, as Michael alluded to close to $2 billion of revenue loss over five-year period. We do think our domestic business; with the exception of the short-haul loss will be pretty close to flat. Clearly that can change as we go throughout the year, if we have a mild summer that could change to the downside and if we have a hot summer that can certainly change to the upside, which is also one of the reasons why as we think about the second half of the year. So it's too early right now to give you too much more guidance that we provided. But we are just trying to give you the best guess based on normalized summer. And then on the export side, we are, I have seen an incredible uptick here over the last six months, the forward curve is pretty clear that indicates that things will come back down as we move through the second quarter and into the second half and the spot market has already reflected that versus the very high benchmark that we saw. But there is no doubt that the coal business is in a much different place as we enter into 2017 than it has been the previous couple of years. Jeff Kauffman : Okay, and just one follow-up and I'm done, because I know we're running over. On the yield side, could you help us think about how to look at or think about modeling yields given some of the mix changes going on in your coal base? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes I think that as you said the short-haul business will obviously help RPU as we go in to 2017. The fact that we don't have that anymore. We did have some pretty significant uptick in the yield there in the fourth quarter. Part of that is the fact that there was some sourcing changes that actually added to the length of haul and also the fact that some of the utilities started to rebuild inventories a little bit more aggressively than they've done before. While on average, they're above there are certain utilities that needed additional coal and that helps the yields as well. And then on the export coal side, clearly as we've said when the benchmark is high, that helps our RPU but as we go through the year it is not impossible that that help will go the other way and will actually RPU as we move through the year. But that really depends on where the benchmark ultimately ends up. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks; good morning. In the chemicals segment, could you please discuss the expected drivers of non-energy growth in 2017? And then also the potential for growth in crude volumes and how you think about the cadence of growth in the segment over this coming year? Thanks. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure. So the good markets to begin with that piece which isn't our chemical business, we have seen a nice run up and now a nice run down and we are at the point now, we are running into fourth quarter less than a train a day of crude-by-rail. So it's going down significantly and as we it's hard to predict what is going to be in 2017 but it's also very difficult to see that it's actually going to move up meaning that if anything I think the bias is towards less crude based on where we see the crude prices and the spreads. If we look at the non-crude piece of our core so to speak, our core chemical business, I think we continue to see that industry doing very well based on the feedstock advantage that they have versus the rest of the world. So lot of investments have been made over the last couple of years and from our perspective we expect slow modest growth in that space as we move through 2017 and may be 1% or 2% I think is the official forecast. And then the other piece that we of course have is the input side to the energy side, the frac span and LPG and that also depends a little bit on where natural gas prices will be, if they stay strong that usually leads to additional input, if they go down that also could put pressure on that. But as we said right now we seem to be in a little different place than we would be in the last couple of years. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. And then real quick, Cindy, with regard to the products or the efficiency savings, how should we think about the cadence for the year? Consistent with the EPS cadence or maybe something different? Thanks. Cindy Sanborn : It will be fairly ratable across the whole quarters, it won't be any one, any one quarter or any one area or time that you will see higher. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning, Justin. Justin Long : Thanks, good morning. So I wanted to ask about export coal first. Could you give some more color on the split between contracted volumes and spot volumes that you're assuming within that full-year tonnage guidance? And in addition, could you talk about the split you expect between met and thermal? Fredrik Eliasson : Sure. Essentially because of the volatility in the marketplace over the last couple of years, everything is spot. There is a few pieces of business that is on more than a quarterly basis, so it could be up to annual basis but essentially all of it is quarterly. So when we give you that guidance it's best in our best case based on what the customers are telling us and the visibility that they have and we obviously triangulate that with some other sources. In terms of the split traditionally it has been around 70 :30 in favor of met over the last couple of years to fourth quarter, we did have some opportunities to move some thermal into Europe because of nuclear shutdowns in France specifically that was very helpful. We'll see how much vibrancy we haven't in 2017 but the split came to 60 :40 in the fourth quarter and as we but as a the best prediction right now, I would probably say it's close to that 70 :30 as we think about 2017. Justin Long : Okay, great. That's helpful. And secondly, I was curious if you could comment on how much of your book of business for 2017 is already repriced at this point. And I know you don't give specific guidance on pricing, but just to get a sense for your high-level directional thought, given the visibility you have, does it feel like the pricing environment has likely hit the bottom and the rate of increases should improve over the course of the year? I think earlier you referenced the second half potentially being a bit stronger. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure, let me just tell you on an average, we probably have about a third of our book of business that we can touch. If you think about auto intermodal to generally three to five years coal and exports are obviously, we set a spot but the utility side, two to four years something like that. And then on the merchandise business probably little bit over half and annual and the rest are two to three year contracts, generally. So that gives you about a third of the business that you can touch each and every year. The significant portion of that is either coming up at the beginning of the year or the mid part of the year and with the majority of that coming in the beginning of the year or I guess the end of the year technically. And so we've done a fair amount of that third already. And as I said I'm not going to get into specific details on it, but we're going to continue to price to the market and we alluded to before, we think that the truck market will get into better place as we move through the year for the right of fact, if you mentioned earlier driver wages should have a pretty significant pressure on it. We do think that the ELD mandate will have an impact as we get through the second half and we also think the economy is going to grow new construction or new build of trucks is down, I think about 35% to 40% year-over-year. So that is also helpful in terms of the fleet itself and then so absolutely throughout the year we hope that after having been a little bit of tougher period here for the last 18 months or so, that will get to better place. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC. You may ask your question. Walter Spracklin : Hi, thanks very much. Two quick questions, both for Cindy here. One on CapEx. I know, Cindy, you talked about the evolving mix change in your CapEx, where it's coming down, yes, but it's also -- the constitution of that CapEx is changing significantly as you convert some of your PTC and perhaps some of your coal spend into new technology. You alluded to a few predictive analytics, mechanical division and so on. My question is how soon could we see the benefit of those? And if you were to rank a couple that are expected to bring in the highest return, what would they be in and, again, how quickly could you see that impact your earnings in the next few years? Cindy Sanborn : I think, Walter I think when we look at these investments and particularly the one around longer sidings for longer trains. It's going to be 2018 before we really see that. So that is the long route that we need to re-sequence how we operate it based on longer trains in either sighting extensions or actual additional sightings. So that's a pretty good one that we see upcoming. On the technology side, there's investments we're making now for this year that we'll see the benefits that are already in our plan are part of our -- our initiatives that we -- that we have in 2017. And of course we're building a longer and more broader sheet of longer-term benefits that we have to build core infrastructure processes within the technology space to then build on and layer on additional opportunity. So and it is across the board, both from a customer facing piece as well the productivity piece and I cannot underemphasize overemphasize safety and not this is all helping us to be a safer railroad. So that's probably that the best color I can give you, Walter. Walter Spracklin : And would you characterize any of these investments as purely CSX developed are these kind of supplier things that suppliers are brought into you as opportunities that might be available to your competitors as well. Cindy Sanborn : I think it's a mix when I look at, for example in fuel, when I look at fuel management technology which is supplier driven, it certainly open to the rest of the industry. We've implemented that and are continuing to see benefits from that. And then there's other technology that will be in-house that are part of our own core systems that will help us be more efficient, that will be more CSX centric so difficult to put a split on that , but it is -- it is a mix. Walter Spracklin : Okay. And then my last question here is on capacity, certainly you have been growing your revenue well in excess of your growth in expenses and part of that productivity certainly some of it may be some use of available capacity. If you look at the capacity in general on your network I guess the question comes, how much more growth, can you achieve where expenses will lag that growth before you get to the level where really the expenses catch-up, is there, is there any sense you have of that run rate of growth ahead of you that can comment that obviously expanding margins before you run into some capacity constraints. Cindy Sanborn : Walter if I say when you think about on a carload basis and our scheduled network, we have plenty of room to grow, particularly between Chicago in the northeast in the Northeast and Florida. A little bit of a cha -- more challenge because of the siding impacts or siding constraints between Chicago and Florida although I will tell you that our variable training schedule concept when we built the longer -- larger train by running changing from a 24-hour dispatch to a 28-hour dispatch. We can now go back to 24-hour dispatch and at a train a week as opposed to a train a day as we run against additional volume. So there are great levers on that side that we can pull, no matter what route we would use. On the unit train side, there would be more that we would have to bring on to support the unit train growth but those are very favorable margins that we would -- that you would want us to do and so it's a bit of a mix based on how traffic comes on. But I feel really comfortable with looking out into 2017 and thinking about volume growth again that we will be able to be very, very efficient with our resource intensity to support volume. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning Brian. Brian Konigsberg : Yes, hi guys, good morning, thanks for taking the question. I know this is running long here so just a couple quick ones. Just on -- so on intermodal, maybe can you just give us an update and characterize the level of competition you're seeing? Obviously, it's been a tough 12 to 18 months there. With the prospect of firming conditions, at the margin at least and perhaps getting even better later in the year, has the competitive dynamic softened a little bit or is it still very tough out there? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes so, I would say that in the fourth quarter, we did see the spot market tighten a little bit, certainly not where it needs to be, but we did see a little bit of a reversal there from the previous few quarters and that's an encouraging sign. I don't think that you're going to get to a significantly better place until you get into that second half of 2017 and probably into 2018. Now having said that, we've been able to grow our domestic intermodal business for over a decade about 7% clip each and every year. Last year was a little bit lower than that, partly because of the market, but also because of the competitive loss. As we think about 2017, I think we're comfortable to say that we're going to return to that kind of 5% to 10% domestic intermodal growth despite the fact that the environment is a little bit more challenged and we would like to see long-term and I think as a testament to the investments we made, the service improvements that Cindy and team has done new terminals opening up continue to work with alignment with some of our channel partners, and so we feel pretty good about where domestic intermodal businesses going into 2017 as well. Brian Konigsberg : Great. That's helpful. And secondly just coming back to the commentary about labor costs and the majority of the inflation related specifically to health and welfare may be this is a little bit hard to answer, but obviously there is a lot of debate right now with the Affordable Care Act. If that does in fact get adjusted could that have potential impacts on the outlook for inflation or is that not applicable. Frank Lonegro : In our context it's not applicable, given the way that our industry, industry trust is set up to handle health and welfare claims from the Union employees. Brian Konigsberg : Understood, great. And if I -- one last quick one. Are there any potential property gains that we could expect in 2017? Frank Lonegro : We always have real estate owned market. Nothing that would compare to the last two years, one was an operating property gain this year and non-operating property gain last year. We try to provide visibility to the bigger ones. There is always going to be a little bit here there that we have on the market and happens. But we will certainly keep you posted, if we have anything big. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners. You may ask your question. Michael Ward : Good morning. Donald Broughton : Good morning, good morning gentlemen. Let me ask the CapEx question a completely different way. Help me think about how you strategically think about the ebb and flow of CapEx. I mean, in my mind, isn't it in the long term strategically isn't it long term cheaper to spend more money on CapEx during periods of lighter or less traffic? And isn't it -- doesn't a more well-invested, better maintained infrastructure make achieving a lower OR on a sustained basis more achievable? And if so, why aren't you taking the current lull in demand as an opportunity to increase CapEx instead of decelerating it? Frank Lonegro : Well let me try to tackle the question in a couple of different ways. In terms of the CapEx that's deployed in any given year, the amount of work associated with that CapEx can change depending on how much volume is on the railroad. When you look at 2015 and 2016, we got a lot of work done for the money that we had especially on the infrastructure side. In addition to the volume levels, all the work that we did on train length and reducing the number of active trains that we had out there gives our engineering forces the ability to get more work done. We saw some good work by procurement department and really looking at how they can leverage lower cost environment that drives CapEx savings on the materials which again allows us to get more work done. So beneath the coverage there, there actually is a recipe that is really aligned with what you're talking about. On the equipment side of the house, it really is going to depend on what types of traffic we have, what are our storage levels on equipment and both on the locomotive side and the freight car side. But what you're seeing us do is really strategically invest to transform the company and the network and the service products much more aligned with revenue portfolio that we expect in the future, which is very different than the revenue portfolio we've had for the last 10 years. Michael Ward : And Donald we don't dramatically disagree with your theory, if you look back to the recession of 2008 and 2009, we kept our capital spend up during that period for the very reason as you have noted which is not defer maintenance, it is continue to maintain and be ready for upswings. So I think theoretically you have a valid point there. Donald Broughton : So if maybe sure I heard what you just said, I think I just heard you say yes you're right to a certain degree, you have already done that over the last year or so. Michael Ward : We have had a very consistent capital program especially during downturns, which is a change in the past many times when there is a downturn, you would cut back on your capital, we don't think that's the right thing to do. We think maintaining a pace, both in good times and bad times allows us to better utilize deploy the capital or see we are changing some of our orientation towards more strategic now to try to improve the return on assets. But theoretically we try to keep a fairly constant 16% to 17% of our revenues as a measure. Michael Ward : Thanks everyone. We appreciate your attention. We will see you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call. You may disconnect your lines.",

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. David Baggs : Thank you, Sherlyn, and good morning everyone. On behalf of the management team I would like to welcome you to our first quarter earnings call, and also thank you for your interest in CSX Corporation. This morning we are being represented by our Chief Executive Officer, Hunter Harrison; our Chief Marketing Officer, Fredrik Eliasson; our Chief Financial Officer, Frank Lonegro; and our Chief Operating Officer; Cindy Sanborn. Now, before we begin the formal part of our presentation this morning, let me remind everyone that the presentation materials, our safety and service measures, our quarterly financial report and our press release announcing our new guidance and dividend and share repurchase are all found on our website at CSX.com under the investors section. In addition, following this presentation later today, our webcast replay and the 10-Q will be filed. And so now let me turn your attention to Slide 2 of our presentation. Here are our forward-looking disclosure statements outlines the risks and uncertainties of forward-looking statements. There will be a number of them this morning during our presentation, and I imagine quite a few during our question-and-answer session. So I would encourage you to take those forward-looking statements in the full context of this disclosure statement. On Slide 3 is our non-GAAP disclosure statement. While CSX does file all of its financials in accordance with US GAAP, we are providing some non-GAAP financial measures in addition to the GAAP financial measures to help you better understand the business. But these measures are not a substitute for GAAP. Finally, I would say that we have close to 30 analysts this morning, and so I would encourage everyone to play nicely in the sandbox, so to speak. You will have one primary and one follow-up question, so that everyone can be heard and we use everyone\u2019s time wisely. And before I turn the presentation over to the team, let me also remind you that the earnings call today is limited to discussions of the earnings and the business of CSX only, and we will not touch upon matters that are currently the subject of the company\u2019s annual meeting. And with that, it is my great pleasure and privilege to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Hunter Harrison. Hunter Harrison : Thank you, David, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. I guess my first comment would be I am back. I didn't think this is going to happen, but [Indiscernible] hopefully \u2013 well, not hopefully, I think factually my last leg on this journey that I have taken on this railroad, [Indiscernible]. In the 50 years did I ever think that I would finish in Jacksonville a group of railroaders with the talent that they did this, and the franchise that is before us, and I am very, very excited about the opportunity. I met yesterday with the first board meeting, formally with our board. I think it is safe to say that all of us were pretty excited about the opportunities going forward. As I found here, [Indiscernible] there is a group of [railroaders]. There might be a little shift in direction, but this company is going to achieve things that some of you don't think could be achieved. I'm not going to spend a lot of your time on the first quarter because I was only here for 30 days, and the three leaders here with their team produced those results are going to spend some time going through that with you. I certainly think it was a pretty outstanding quarter. As an outsider certainly looking in and it builds the foundation for us to go forward on with our plans for the future. I would say that I was reflecting this morning on what I might say here today and I know if you look at the various [Indiscernible] that we deal with, certainly our investors are represented \u2013 certainly our employees are represented. The one group that is so important to us that is not represented directly that I am [Indiscernible], and I am extremely excited. If you look at our service offering as it is today, there is a lot yet to learn but pretty good job in our bulk movement and cycles. Do a good job in the intermodal area. I think all of us would say that in our core merchandise category, we can make some significant improvement. I think the [majority] have already started down that road. And I think you will see some what I would characterize as some pretty dramatic changes in our cycles and I think you will see things like from Chicago to Florida markets that we will take two and three days out of that as a result of some strategies you are going to hear about today. So I think that is pretty exciting for the customer base. So without me taking additional time let me turn it over to the team here, and let Frank give us some observations on the results in the quarter. Frank Lonegro : Thanks Hunter, and good morning everyone. Consistent with the transformation that we are undertaking through Precision Scheduled Railroading under Hunter\u2019s leadership and knowing that you are eager to ask questions this morning, we are going to be very efficient in the way that we discuss the numbers. So with that as a backdrop, let us turn to Slide 7. The safety of our employees in the communities that we serve will continue to be a top priority for CSX and for this leadership team. While the personal-injury frequency index was 9% higher year-over-year the absolute number of injuries was down slightly, and that is part of our continuing drive towards the ultimate goal of zero injuries. Our train accident frequency index was 25% improved with substantially fewer reportable incidents. In terms of efficiency, we are continuing to drive both train length improvements and fuel efficiency gains, while our service levels remain stable on a year-over-year basis. Cindy Sanborn : Thanks Frank. Let me just add a little bit. First of all, it is very exciting to be working with Hunter here, and as the operating leader spend a lot of time with him. And so I will talk a little bit about the quarter, but I will talk about going forward how we are working on some of the items that Hunter has briefly alluded to this morning. First of all, as you would expect, and has always been the case for CSX safety is our highest priority, and we will continue to focus on that not only employee injury performance, but train accidents in order to improve or make sure that the communities that we operate through we operate through safely. Turning to productivity, in the first quarter we delivered $123 million worth of savings. Significant resource productivity drove this. Continued train length opportunities and reduction in crew starts, and also we saw some other support costs, particularly in engineering and mechanical labor cost also affecting us positively in the quarter. But I think what we really want to hit on here is how we think about our business going forward to drive to and in the past six weeks we have done a couple of key things I will just highlight this morning. One, we have adapted our operating plans to incorporate some of our unit train business into our merchandise business \u2013 merchandise service. And this allows us to do a couple of things, as you think about our 28 hour train dispatch, our variable train dispatch, we did that in order to improve our train length and we have done that and very successful with it. But I think what is helping us continue to move forward with train length and cycle time improvement is adding the vast network into the merchandise service, so now we can have a more balanced network with a more highly likely probability of seven-day a week service and still keeping the length of the trains where it is productive. This also serves our customers well as we are able to improve dwell time in our terminals as a result of these changes. The second item that we have been working on is reduce our \u2013 changing or converting our switching operations in some of our traditional pump yards into a flat yard model. We have 12 pump yards across the system. To date we have converted four of those over into flat switching operations. This has allowed us to reduce \u2013 support resource efficiencies, particularly in managing the infrastructure that is necessary to support in pump yards, in the pumping process, reduce that as well as at the end our plan has been focusing on improving the cycle times through those terminals. So we have been able to do both of those things. As we look forward, we expect to continue to reduce several pump yards. We don't have a hard and fast specific number. We look at each one individually. We will make sure we are making the right decisions to improve both productivity and service. And I would also say that as we look at our quarter one measurements, our network performance measurements we are seeing as we have implemented some of these changes I am talking about, improved dwell time, improved velocity across the network and we think that will compound the effect of some of the changes that we are making to lead us to feel very comfortable moving forward that will actually have record productivity in 2017 following our previous record productivity in 2015. So overall I think the team is doing very well coming together with some significant changes as we adjusted to the reductions in management headcount as part of our first quarter initiative. We saw a lot of change there and we are continuing to see change, and we are driving that effectively I believe, and we will continue to do so incorporating that into our business model going forward. Frank Lonegro : Thanks Cindy. Those are great insights for the analysts and for the investors. Going forward as we implement Precision Scheduled Railroading you will see what we believe is a powerful combination of improved safety, improved service and improved efficiency that exemplifies a great railroad. We believe that that powerful combination will benefit employees, customers and shareholders alike. Turning to Slide 8, the GAAP view of our income statement highlights the 10% year-over-year top line improvement, which has been achieved through a combination of volume growth, higher fuel surcharge recoveries, favorable mix and value pricing. ,: As for the charge of the combined impact of increased fuel prices, inflation and volume, were nearly offset by the $123 million of efficiency savings that you heard Cindy reference. The focus on cost control and a rising volume environment produced incremental margins of over 70%, excluding the charge. Bottom line, ex-charge CSX delivered record first-quarter operating ratio of 69.2%, operating income of $885 million, and a record first quarter EPS of $0.51.  Turning to Slide 9, these financial results drove over $1 billion in operating cash flow, a nearly $300 million year-over-year improvement. This improvement carried through to free cash flow before dividends of $630 million. Earlier this morning we announced a free cash flow target of around $1.5 billion for the year, which takes into consideration the combined impact of our earnings trajectory and a Capex reduction of over $100 million. We continue to remain focused on returning capital to shareholders through a balanced deployment strategy. In the quarter, we distributed $166 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, while repurchasing 258 million of CSX shares. Having now completed the two-year $2 billion program we commenced in April of 2015, we were pleased to announce a new one-year $1 billion buyback program earlier this morning. While ROIC was stable on a year-over-year basis, we fully expect that it will inflect more positively going forward as we continue to increase efficiency and reduce the asset intensity of our railroad. Debt-to-EBITDA was also relatively stable as we continue to appropriately utilize our balance sheet and remain committed to a BBB+ Baa1 credit-rating. Turning to Slide 10, the volume outlook for the second quarter is largely positive with nearly 70% of our markets in the favorable category and over 20% of our markets in the neutral activity. Only domestic coal is expected to be unfavorable in the second quarter. Fredrik Eliasson : To just add a little color to that, if you look at the macroenvironment, several indicators support continued growth. Obviously the economy continues to grow at a modest pace, GDP in the 2% to 2.5% range for the full year and probably a similar pace in the second quarter itself. The consumer sentiment continues to be at high levels, which helps many of our markets especially the intermodal market. At the same time though the truck market right now continues to see excess capacity. But as we move through the year we do expect that to gradually improve in the second half and into \u201918. And then, of course, on the favorable side export coal had a very strong year in the first quarter, 8.7 million tons that we moved in the first quarter. We do expect that to taper off as we move through the year, but we still think that an upper 20 million range in terms of tons for the full year on the export side is a good estimate at this point. As we think about some of the headwinds, we think that auto production is clearly flattening out, and we think for the rest of the year relatively flat. It is probably a good place to think about the auto business, and then while the core chemical market continues to grow at a nice pace we expect crude by rail to continue to decline both year-over-year and sequentially as we move through the rest of 2017. And then of course on the unfavorable side, we see our domestic coal business. We talked about it in the fourth quarter, we lost some short-haul business but despite that we did about 15 million tons here in the first quarter on the domestic side and we expect a similar pace in the second quarter. But as you saw in the first quarter the quality of the revenue and the impact to the bottom line is still very strong and we expect that to continue as we move through the year. It is obviously reflected in our RPU. So I would say overall we feel good about the top line. We continue to expect our merchandise and intermodal business to grow at or above the economy as a whole, and it is nice to see coal revenue to be growing a little bit here this year as well. And lastly and echoing Cindy\u2019s comments earlier, we are very excited about what this operating model can do for CSX, not just in terms of the bottom line, but really what it can do for our customers. We are already seeing that from a service perspective both in terms of transit time, reliability and recoverability. So we feel very good about this change. Michael Ward : Thanks Fredrik. A very helpful again commentary for the investors and for the analysts. Let us finish up on Slide 11, with our first quarter results we are off to a very good start in 2017 and expect to accelerate the transformation to Precision Scheduled Railroading in the coming quarters. Earlier this morning you saw that we issued full year guidance, excluding restructuring charges. To that end in 2017 CSX expects to achieve a mid-60s operating ratio, record efficiency gains that you heard Cindy mention, EPS growth of around 25% off of 2016\u2019s reported EPS of $1.81 and free cash flow before dividends of around $1.5 billion. In issuing these expectations we assume, of course, that the coal markets and the overall economy will remain stable. This morning we were also pleased to announce 11% or $0.02 increase in the quarterly dividend along with a new one-year $1 billion share buyback program. And finally we look forward to sharing our longer-term plans with you in the second half of the year.  With that we will be delighted to take your questions this morning. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Go ahead with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Hunter, I guess my first one for you I know with have a scheduled day later in the year perhaps to hear more about the longer-term plan, but the initial impressions that were laid out in the file, could you just give us some context in terms of where do think the significant opportunities are to further streamline the network, you talked about monetizing real estate, which is a target that \u2013 any specific when you are there, and just in general if you think there is just too much track with too few [Indiscernible] going over there, just the ability to improve the network density and the design as you move forward over the next couple of years? Hunter Harrison : Let me \u2013 I don\u2019t think that this franchise is significantly different than others that we have overlaid this model with. Cindy touched on a lot of these things, and as we have talked internally, we don't have some ironclad numbers on what the headcount number got to be, what the pump closures got to be. It is going to be what is smart to do. I don\u2019t think that I have spent a great deal of time with Cindy and her team. We are \u2013 I think step one was cutting through a lot of bureaucracy. We are getting through where we had nine-divisions, and so we are going to be going down to maybe a couple. [Indiscernible] just cost money, and I think we are trying to streamline that. We are trying to get the right leadership in the right spot. We have got nine dispatching offices. I don't think any railroad has nine dispatching offices, and we are going to make some efforts there. There is efforts going on now promoting productivity, I would expect before the summer is up, we will have 550 or so locomotives [restored]. We will probably have 25,000 freight cars put up, and all of the associated costs that go with them, labor, material, and the locomotive fuel productivity, velocity, and a lot of things, dwell time in terminals I would say would come down dramatically. Some of our facilities historically have they been overbuilt? Yes.  Like the auto railroad. But this railroad has had a special challenge. If you look back at the mergers, there were more companies involved with mergers of that what is now the CSX than any other major railroad. So if you are going to place [Indiscernible] and we have four or five yards, well, it is because you have money to have a yard there if you go through some of these common points. So, we are doing some things. For example, [Indiscernible] is a good example, where I think we have four yards there. Cindy is helping me here, and I think we will be down to, maybe there is one super operation there. But I know we have a track of land there that is an operating proxy that needs to be a good deal of money. So there is going to be some monetization of assets. So this is going to be more of the same at maybe a more rapid pace taking advantage of larger opportunities. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, great. Thanks Hunter. So, just one quick follow-up just on the coal side, Frank or Fred, if you could just give us a sense is that the export market price and that really spiked pretty much after the quarter ended. So, just want to see if you thought that the mix, the favorable benefit that you saw in the first quarter is something that you would also be able to capture in the second and third quarter? Thank you. Frank Lonegro : Well, thank you. We don't forecast size, but we have said overall, over time that we do have indexes on our contracts on the export side that when things go well we share some of those economics, and when things aren\u2019t as well, we take some of that pain. Clearly this quarter, it wasn\u2019t just export pricing that helped. We also see some pretty favorable mix and a lot of that mix we do expect to continue, but it of course, depends on where we see the utility business, for example, go in terms of resale replenishment of the inventories of through the years. So, I think there's a favorable mix story and favorable sort of going forward but I think it's unclear at this point how favorable it's going to be through the year. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. You may ask your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hi, great. Thanks, and good morning. Michael Ward : Good morning. Chris Wetherbee : I want to touch on the volume side, Hunter. If you could just sort of give your initial impressions on what you give sort of volume opportunities that are out there for CSX, obviously playing in the E3 automatically kind of think of the intermodal market and efficiency obviously played big and to being able to gain shareable from truck as well as your rail competitors. Can you give us a sense as what your initial impressions are about sort of the franchise there and how you think about that going forward? Hunter Harrison : Well, I'm obviously in 30 days, I've limited amount of knowledge. I will say that I think one of these starting things going forward with this organization as well as rail overall is the opportunity catch before us to get this off the hour. And I think that we're set up in almost a perfect storm here to take advantage of that. If you look at that we have we start with a strong base to begin with, with great market that we serve up and down the East Coast and Chicago, Florida, and some really some growth areas, where there is congestion, the highway systems aren\u2019t going to be able to contemplate everything. If you look at the advantages of rail would, from an environmental standpoint, from an energy standpoint. And if you look at an organization that is going to be able to take a combination of dual times and terminals about limiting terminals, which lowers cost, that at the same time then takes dual times now from an average of effectively a day or 25 hours or 26 hours of dual, down to 18 or so, and you say we're going to skip some terminals and you start to look at really what we used to talk about the strong competitive, that is not strong competitive, it's better than pro. Now, the issue is the change and is tried to take that to the market place and to sell it and converted and change it. But that's where look the individual markets, I mean this can be just as we guess more the competitors out there, we'll stretch and fighting and win the business there. The real opportunity has been is on the in the high wall. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, that's very helpful. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up thinking about some of the guidance and we had to think about it a little bit beyond 2017. So, mid-60s for this year, we're having pull forward some of the benefit, but clearly some of the things you are going to be doing are going to be gaining traction as the year progresses. Presumably you'll be entering 2018 at a better run rate. So, obviously I'm trying to jump the gun here a little bit and get some of this forward. Look, before you might be ready to give it but when you think about 2018, and I think you got it wrong in the respect that it is sort of natural that some of the benefits you're acquiring in 2017 will be playing out in 2018 and maybe we're thinking about something like the low 60s or show a warn in 2018? Hunter Harrison : Is that based -- send me your mail, Chris, and I'll fill it in. I think you're right on. Look, this is not the first time this movie played out. We see opportunities, not going to happen overnight. Is it going to exactly linear? No. will be there be a fair step approach? Yes. Do we have any barriers here? Structural issues, as we deal with the board discuss, we can't do what's been done before. And even go beyond that? No reason. Chris Wetherbee : Got you, that makes sense. Thanks very much, it's worth the shot. I appreciate it. Hunter Harrison : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. Hunter Harrison : Good morning, Tom. Tom Wadewitz : Hunter, I wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on the opportunity at CSX versus what you saw at CP. I think of your approach being one of the things you do is simplify the flow of traffic and reduce work event. If CSX has a greater complexity and the network begin with versus CP, that would have find maybe greater opportunity for cost take out in or as you take out that, that complexity right simplify things. So, that's the right framework and I wanted to see if you could comment on that and maybe compare the opportunity you see so far at CSX versus what you had at CP. Hunter Harrison : Well, I mean, Tom, they're totally different franchises. The maker, the market. As generally speaking, a lot of roads are in North America. So, you look behind your belt and you say look what is the best way to operate and run this franchise and I think that the -- there is a lot of talk about this is not a simple T operation that it got all the complexities and the density and the spaghetti bowls. Well, the waiting, the hand led, eat his spaghetti and get rid of it. So, one of the things we've done, is the same the time we work diligently on is being sure that we're not going through terminals and process and cars just because the terminals there. So, it's almost kind of the old term we use before the wide motocross, let's start on with this franchise. The last, and I was there yesterday when I talked to group but the last stop yard, it was built in North America, the last two, with one and way across which is the heart of this CSX in my view. And the other one was our [indiscernible] in mid-80s. Markets have changed since mid-80s. Demand of traffic that's bulk, that is intermodal, that is very nearly -- true trends. It don\u2019t have to be sold it in Swiss, so you adopt that year your operating strategies to the market. And I just think that there's much more of a natural fit to make some of the changes that we need to make here that will present even more opportunities to both year point for the complexity as said in the past and built in and simplified. This franchise, if you apply the marker here to some degree, adds more potential than anyone up there will. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great, that's helpful, I appreciate it. Then the second question of the follow-up would be, CSX approached intermodal has benefit different than I think what typical if you look at Norfolk, they have the corridor strategy. I think that will be more characteristic maybe of the Canadian road. But CSX has this Baltimore Ohio hub strategy, and has talked about one in the South East. Do you think that is the right approach to continue or do you think on the intermodal network is their opportunity to maybe simplify and go towards more of a kind of a origin to destination as opposed to sending it to the hub that you have in Baltimore Ohio? Thank you. Hunter Harrison : Well, Tom, I don\u2019t want to get into about there. I'm sure the people here they\u2019ve have potentially a different better strategy given what they had to work with. The operating groups challenge is to present velocity and speed in customer requirements to the marketing sales group and then given how well that service going to apply to the market, then its spreads changed job into this end of service to take that to the market. And I think a better product raw product this Wendy and team can produce the more successful and more latitude, it will give thread and technique till I think that I think the competition, we're going to get bears in our rear view mirror and they're going to be looking at the rear, we're going to be pass him on the left. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. Thank you for the time, Hunter, I appreciate it. Hunter Harrison : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Allison Landry : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Hunter, Chicago has always been at the forefront of your mind and historically you've made comments that CSX used the Chicago belt and perhaps the Indiana belt for switching more than any of the other rail. So, now that you're in arguably a much better see to effects change. Do you have any plan to pick Chicago and if so could you provide some content surrounding that? Hunter Harrison : I don\u2019t know that how quick to pick Chicago. But Chicago is a special issue. And if you noticed in a lot of our what we've discussed and talked about, it hadn\u2019t included Chicago, but those Chicago we here affectively carved out and are taking a different special type look at. Chicago has some real challenges to this all North American infrastructure. Chicago cannot survive as it is today. You got law suits now, the imminent domain, had you want to take rail infrastructure to replace it with that one. You got it right beside all here. Okay. Everybody wants to grow, they want to grow in Chicago and it's not going to work. Now, the plus for us is this. We own a lot of assets in Chicago and we can be a more significant player that in positions that been in the past. And only one move could change things in Chicago and so people have to be aware of it and not I don\u2019t read, I'm not going to mention the term but just a stroke of a pen of a partnership could shift a lot of track away from Chicago, and infrastructure thing to people think it's need for Chicago will be needed. For example, if you look at Kansas City today. Kansas City used to be a Chicago. And we were little late in the real business and built tons of infrastructure and now you look at Kansas City and it's pretty much rail business relative to the infrastructure. So, Chicago is going to be gravy on top of this plan of what we eventually decide we're able to do with our partners and fellow owners and all the other entities that want to be part of Chicago. So, it\u2019s real opportunity is that we're taking a special look at. Allison Landry : Okay. And when you refer to the stroke of a pen of a partnership, is that a single partnership that you have in mind or could it be multiple? Hunter Harrison : Look, I don\u2019t have anything in mind. I got four years contract, I want to go out and CSX with a green, with a blue and gold jersey running under the goal post, okay. If even if I want to do something after that, it's up to them. I'm only pointing out that one of the challenges that's brought to my attention, almost every time, I'd be with the big customer, is real consolidation. And in spite of the fact that which you might hear, in proper statement, we got to LA to a customer in South and West of adding service to New York and I'll talk to you about half of it. They don\u2019t want to hear about half of it, they want to hear about all of it. And until one easy and control movement rail is never going to have the competitive alternative to the highway. But what I'm just pointing out that for a lot of these reasons, Chicago was kind of a wild card. Allison Landry : Okay. And then, as a follow-up question, how are you thinking about the coal network or other areas of the network that doesn't necessarily have as much density as you would like. And I know there was sort of a question earlier in this round. But ask a little bit differently, is there any opportunity to short line any of this business and are there any carriers or holding companies that you think would be a good fit? Hunter Harrison : Now, look I think that -- I think that you give us off to and buy into, what we say we're going to do, that you don\u2019t need to think about short liners all the time. I do think that we do domestically move coal a little bit different than I'm traditionally used to, in a very disciplined close loop unit train operation that can be much more efficient. You can't move unit train coal train for three days and then park them two days and then run them for three days and then move again to very efficiently. Now if you do that there is a higher pulse associated with it with higher cost maybe comes the higher price. So what we are trying to do both with the -- is to create and encourage our super stores with us to create more disciplined approach what we can do with [indiscernible] and fewer locomotives and we can be more competitive for them and give them a constant supply of coal which is what they want and if we developed the reliability we need then it will all come together. Allison Landry : Okay. Excellent. Thank you for the time. Operator : Thanks. The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question, Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is just on the operating expectations for this year. It looks like the OR target of the mid 60s implies around 800 million year-over-year on your profit improvement. It just seems by our estimate at least that only about 300 million of that will come from revenue growth and improved fixed cost absorption which leaves about call it somewhere close to half a billion dollars of absolute reduction in the cost base. So first of all is that the type of cost take out that you hunter in the team and are targeting to realize this year and just for our own, my own avocation, how does one achieve sort of half a billion dollar of cost take out without maybe driving a significant amount of disruption at least in the near term. Thank you. Frank Lonegro : Amit, let me, it's Frank, let me take that one first and then turn it over to Hunter for additional commentary. In the targets that we gave you one of the things that we mentioned was record productivity embedded within that is obviously the prior record of $427 million in 2016 so clearly you can have your own estimate in terms of how much we will exceed that to a very good start in terms of the $123 million of efficiency. I think from just a line item perspective other than fuel you should expect us to continue to drive cost out across the board in terms of the various items there when you look at better service you look better productivity, you look at the ability to absorb volume with literally no additional cost associated with that, you get huge flow through from what your expectations are on the revenue side. So we are kicking one off cylinders here in terms of the volume side, the pricing side and the efficiency side so that's what gave us the confidence to put out the targets that we did this morning. Michael Ward : Yes, I mean I don't want to add more example that which you want to look at odd numbers just the achieve it. Taking on some initiative to take the 1000 position, those 1000 positions were a lot of more voluntary and there was store room that is what we are all position that has not touch any of the [inaudible] we are going to utilize the people internally we have, we are very sensitive to your comment about the disruption and the moral and we have at [inaudible] but it is a little higher when normal and so I think if you had the [inaudible] member on it and I haven\u2019t got into that kind of level yet but I think the potential is there that sometime around the first half of the year by the end of, there would be probably be a similar number taken out also now we didn\u2019t take any of those to take some real cost without impacting the service or safety or anything else. These are just a different ways to doing things. We are bringing some job own. We have, I don\u2019t know all of that, 250 or 300 boys in India, we are reviewing those jobs back here but [inaudible] also some job but I am really [inaudible] worried about India right now I am worried about CSX [inaudible] America, so there is a lot of opportunity and I don\u2019t think that there was a breach as far as we do the job and we have the ability to do that we can achieve all these things that we dealt that. Frank Lonegro : Okay, one other point on the folks in India, there are contractors not employees but obviously we're going to in source that work and really look to absorb that with the existing workforce. I know Cindy also had some points, she wanted to make here. Cindy Sanborn : I just put it in a couple of broad categories as I think about it. [inaudible] mentioned the reduction in the management that took place last month, I think as you think about [inaudible] conversions and so forth those types of actions I would call core operations and we expect to do more of that. Volume absorption, we are seeing our outlook with a higher level of volume for us to move and we think we can absorb that of more efficiently than putting resources back one for one and then I would also say, some of the, looking back and some of the improvements that we have made other railroads [inaudible] I would call it network efficiency cars online velocity [inaudible] those types of things, we think will see improvement improvements there. So I would call that just network efficiencies going forward. And when you put all that together that's what's given us our confidence to move forward with that with another record here. Amit Mehrotra : Right. Well thanks for all that. Let me just ask one follow up if I could. Frank, on your comments about productivity, maybe I'm thinking about incorrectly but I feel like productivity is different than absolute reduction in the cost structure? Because productivity is in my view the way I understand it you're optimizing the cost structure to maximize the incremental, may be minimized to detrimental but it doesn't necessarily mean the cost structure is declining. So you guys achieved 72% incremental operating margin in the quarter which is unbelievably great. Is there a way to understand or help us in terms of what was that was actually fix cost absorption? What was that actually absolute reduction the cost structure? Frank Lonegro : So, when we think about productivity and how, I would say keep score internally, we do look for structural cost reductions. So a big part of that record productivity, structural cost reductions meaning each line item in the expenses is going to get lower again I'm excluding fuel just given the price environment that we're in but we are focused on fuel efficiency as well. I think there as you can see from an incremental margin perspective, we're also a very good start with about 72% incremental for the first quarter when you understand what we're trying to do on the cost side and you will understand what the volume outlook looks like I would estimate that the incremental margins were actually improve throughout the year which is going to give you the bottom line to flow through the revenue that we are bringing up. Amit Mehrotra : That's great. Hunter, one last one for me if I could. Can you just comment on your relationship with the union so far? You have the company has over 20,000 union employees, can you just talk about those initial meetings and conversations and just in the context of all the operational changes to come? That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Hunter Harrison : Well, I hope it's pretty good. I've worked most of my career. The first four years alongside of the various roles that now make up the effects and those some of the leadership I've had some, I mean terrible what I say here, I had some bad things conversations, exploring new opportunities with those individuals. It's not real common for a new CEO to get me in and I don't care what your name is in the labor leaders to be bringing in a [inaudible] that just now, [inaudible] but at the same time I [inaudible] to be approached unofficially at least, the conversations about potentially there was something like an hourly agreements that has been extended in some part of the US system and now the Canadian national that we developed. It is very encouraging to say that, even that there are dialogue like that and one of the things that, the beauty of that would be, a couple of things that the people should think that one : those agreements guarantee people position that\u2019s important today people they certainly have job and they have the job guarantee and that\u2019s very important in people and at the same time for us it lowers our, potentially our cost, 30% to 35%. So we're going to have some squabbles. They don't like to see their people disrupted nor do I but you got to do which you got to do some time. And so there'll be some, I'm sure there'll be some, comment but all I care about is the bottom line and profit and I hope that in turn we're very sensitive to the employees in the part they play in this. So I think we'll do fine with it. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Thank you for answering my questions, I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Ravi Shankar : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Hunter, just to summarize tie-up everything you said in the call so far in terms of playbook the precision railroading playbook that you've so effectively deployed several times before at other railroads, do you think that's kind of directly applicable to CSX here or do you think the complexity of the network here involves changes to the way that it's been under before and also CSX has in recent years had a playbook of deemphasizing coal and becoming more of an intermodal rail. Do you agree with that and do you think that kind of becomes part of your playbook as well. Hunter Harrison : Well, the question was, yes it was. I think, is the more complexity there in the network the better model you can apply to it, you can get more advantages or opportunity but if you just got a linear street line railroad because there would be lot of people can do that into the model to that. So this has certainly, those implications. Now, strategically going down there in the line as to far as, look I think, if you look at three years out of five years, out of ten years that we need to understand that the world is going to continue to change though and we need to be flexible and to have a plan that allows us to change with those changes, okay. And we got things going on as we speak from energy standpoint, what is the future of fossil fuel, what is the future of crude, how much influence of the environment is going to have? What is the next we are going to do with the railroad, you go ahead inject rail, you drive manage huge warehouse of Amazon and so the supply chain is going to change and we have to be, going to be some of the game that are traditional [inaudible] we have to be more flexible and more creative to be able to deal with those changes in the world. Frank Lonegro : I mean we have to emphasized call CSX, the coal has been the emphasize by the utility and so we want as much business as we can what is called, but we will deploy our strategy where we can capture the growth and create the bottom line value for CSX through excellent service to our customers. Ravi Shankar : Got it and your vision of your intermodal, is this largely, I think you spoke about service initiatives a little earlier on the call, but it is largely a case of improving the service levels and gain to a point where it become super-competitive versus struck or are you looking for more demand improvement from macro or kind of being able to take price and segments. So between service and demand and price kind of which do you think is the most important level for intermodal? Hunter Harrison : I don\u2019t know that, the market would have you believe, to begin with, we are not going to sit here and let our precious service the kind of commodity and so that there we create in service and I would [inaudible] at this we are just in time an intermodal get real hot, if you look back and do a little history, you will see that prior I am in, it was not going to our 20% [inaudible] you let interest rate and they are going back up after, I just can\u2019t tell you when they do people do move merchandize will be rewarded because caring are going to go up. The beauty is this the quicker we move it, the cheaper it is and so it goes on itself and so we turn the equipment quicker, we give better service to the customer and we got the lower cost and then we can may more convincing and it all fits in this model. Ravi Shankar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Ken Hoexter : Good morning. Hunter, you sound well I look forward to your tenure at CSX. If you noted you're going to be an advocate for customers in your intro remarks. Is that a change in how you're going to attack the plan? I mean after you've left obviously we heard keep talk about fixing ruffled feathers and a customer focus. So now it sounds like you start this with a little bit of a different tact. Maybe you can just talk about that a bit. Hunter Harrison : I have in my whole career in fact one of the reasons why I'm sitting here was I have to be an operating guys that [inaudible] okay. I have got a little reputation [inaudible] people look at your bill and that wouldn't they do on the ground, but look there's no one more sensitive than I am and more [inaudible] than I am of the business that our customers yield, okay. I am the greatest advocate in the world which you could sit in some of our meetings when we talk about service and we talk about [inaudible] because that\u2019s not just about creating pain and suffering for our customers which I don\u2019t want to see creating. One example of a customer turn over a period just when we are going to do a transition that sense any problem or issue from it didn\u2019t exist, okay. So I am going to do a little coaching couple of mine and actually anticipate had a response. Ken Hoexter : Let me just read it, something you talked about on the union because the US has changed like historically have been a little bit different right in terms of all the rails coming to negotiating in one team against kind of the all the unions in one group. You always had things may be a little bit differently in Canada, can you, is that something you think you need to shift how you would address that as you move forward? Hunter Harrison : Well, I think, if you look back, the parts when I was parts of the U.S. operation, we were not part of handling. So negotiated our labor agreement and then we can do that now we are going to have some dialog it appears to me and I have had a chance to some of my colleague about it but it appears to me that some of the big -- if you will or seven or they start to see the world differently than if they start to see the world differently and then on one page and that's makes a lot of sense to have this one big care conference negotiated for us. I would much prefer I think us to sit down with our employees and do what's the best for the organization and employee. So I think that all those things that deal with policies and all we will take a look at it and see how they see the world and how we see going forward and what's the most appropriate action. Operator : Thanks. Your next questions comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. You may ask your question. Brandon Oglenski : Yes good morning and thanks for taking my question and Hunter definitely welcome back and I know there is a lot of investors excited to see you back in the field. So surprisingly though it just keeps coming back we hear it a lot that length of farm, and the short length of farm from the east coast just means that the return on invested capital or the margin potential is not as high as railroads or some of the stuff going out, out west in the US can you just talk to that dynamic and whether or not you think length of plays a lot of determination in the ultimate profitability of the network. Hunter Harrison : Well [indiscernible] the markets of the market. We don't get a chance to make the market. I know this the more productive we are the better we are at cost controlling that cut inflation -- controlling cost okay will put us in the position that says people used to say -- 800 miles plus you could make -- well that's not true. If you are operating -- 90s it's true. The operating ratio is 58 it's wrong. So it's I don't really, necessarily while on the short it's the bottom-line margin that we can make out the business and what I don't think we set the price out there. The market sets the price which we want to play or not. And we keep ourselves competitive with the market both with long and short term. Brandon Oglenski : And if I could, kind of also that question maybe what Ken was asking well there is some fear that as you go through these operations changes and focus more on service that maybe some of your customers are disruptive from the way business is done in the past is there potential here that you see some share shift as you go through this transition period or do you think as service improve you could actually improve top line at the same time. Hunter Harrison : Yes. That's the story. That's why you provide good service. It starts with your product but you don't have the product you don't have anything. So we start with the product and the better we make that product the more we can extract in value added both in market share and whatever the revenue. So this is not one set of the game. It's the revenue up and cost down and investor get rewarded and it's fun. Okay. Brandon Oglenski : We look forward to Hunter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Scott Group : Hey thanks. Good morning everyone. So maybe Fredrik can you isolate the strength and export pricing from the mix benefit of losing the short haul business and understand what bigger impact in the quarter and can you just kind of confirm it if the guidance for the year assumes kind of export pricing stays where it is or that it does come down in the back half of the year and then bigger picture on call maybe for you Hunter, we can see this quarter how profitable the coal franchise is if we kind of assume that coal resumes at secured in the next couple of years do you think that maybe could impact the ability to get to us sub 60 OR in a couple of years? Fredrik Eliasson : So let me take your first part of your question first. I would say that the majority of the [indiscernible] change was stable mix, with favorable mix on one hand that some of that short haul traffic obviously went away which was short in marginal but also we saw a more replenishment of utilities in the south versus last year where if you recall not for gas prices were tremendously low for design and then also on the export side we saw additional traffic going into the Virginia which is generally little bit of a export there that is longer length of haul so we had a couple of things that was favorable from a mix perspective that certainly helped so that was the majority of the driver that we saw. And then turning to question about the coal franchise to Hunter. Hunter Harrison : My numbers, my analysis as a short timer don't include some big goal, if coal comes back stronger than anticipated it's very \u2013 will it change any of these numbers, I don't think so. If you look at the last story we get the same thing -- and you will get to the numbers well I think that group has done an excellent job and they continue to do it I think they bound through 60 it through with their life 58 so no I don't think that I have set longer term almost \u2013 western Canada that I can't retract it. I just take longer term coal is not something that rails should depend on. Now it can take a while to transition out it's not going to happen overnight and we might see another 10-15 years but longer term I don't think that fuel I mean coal is going to be the energy source of the future. Scott Group : Okay and just the part about coal pricing assumed in the guidance in the back half. Hunter Harrison : Well overall, side that we follow in this index after the variety of them and as you can see in the forward curve currently that is coming down as we move through second half of the year and that certainly then our expectations as well but we will ultimately see where the market ends up. Scott Group : Okay. Thanks and then Hunter since this is your first call, there is couple of things that I want to address. There is some people that presume that ultimately M&A is part of the strategy and maybe you can talk about that and then also in some of your past, you have brought some people on in terms of the team should we be expecting something similar here? Hunter Harrison : Well look I don't know what I can say but I would emphasize, okay M&A has nothing to do with this strategy here at all okay. And one thing I take very proud and the integrity okay I am telling you there is no such plan. Even I don't have hands I have got four years it's not going to happen in 10 years [indiscernible] is a lot to play with the hand and bill okay and we got a good hand here. Now do we have a couple of midst, maybe but we are looking internally in fact that was last night talking about some people. I am not sure that we have \u2013 that we have taken advantage of all the internal talents that we have here. But if we hint avoid that we have that we need then we can \u2013 we always have the ability to go externally. If there anybody wants to get the work force the list is long and we don't have any restrictions about who can leave and can't go here, they can't go there. We are okay, work here they can leave. Okay. In fact if they want to go some other railroad let them go. But we have got we will not have a short of talent and resources to be on the railroad that we described. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Your line is open. Go ahead and ask your question. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much. Welcome back, good to have you back on. My questions have been asked six ways to Sunday how CCX differs from some other rails you have been at but what I would like to know is at CP there needed to be a capital investment and sighting and some other portions of the rail to achieve the things you wanted to achieve. CN it was different investment can you talk a little bit not so much about multiple yards because we have been built through acquisition but talk about the capital plan at CCX and is there investment that needs to occur for what you need to do and kind of how we think about that strategically. Michael Ward : Well. Overall just to look at it without starting to break it down, I think it's clear to me that the capital investment will come down overtime. It has been a good deal since the last few years about -- if you take a look at just what's been spent the last few years on locomotives you would say we are not going to have to do that for a while if we get 550-600 locomotives stored and I can know one of our previous experiences there that we count as numbers and we said well maybe we can take couple of year holiday for locomotives and we did and I think fifth year holiday. So well, we don't have to spend anything on locomotives generally for four, five years clearly a lot of the replacements that were issued with the yards are not there clearly if we have sighting that are too short for the longer train we are certainly not going to leave those sit on the ground and not being utilized so we will pick up 165 [indiscernible] railroad included with the another 6500 and that will we got 13000 and the only thing we capitalized is in the labor we don't have to capitalize the rail and so there is some ways save capital and another issue of overlook is this the better productivity you have with capital the more you can put in. the higher productive you are good in lower with 100 miles main productive stuff is the productivity factor -- but I think my numbers were that over three or four year period we can see 500-600 million reduction in the capital spend and then there are points where you will potentially trend back up and if we don't have something else like coming along to help with our capital spend and I am not big of some percent of revenue we should work that that way and out whatever is the revenue is but I think overall to answer your question there will be some positive for free cash flow out of the reduction in capital. Jeff Kauffman : Okay. Well Hunter thank you for your answer and best of luck to you all at CCX. Thank you. Michael Ward : . : Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. You may ask your question. David Vernon : Hey good morning. Hunter maybe just a quick question for you on the presence of the share asset areas the old legacy of acquisition is that sort of joint operations in some of the bigger eastern metros create any challenges or opportunities for you when you think about railroad model into the CFX? Michael Ward : Well I don't have to, I have not spent in my first company days a lot of time in that area and I'm limited on my knowledge there and I don\u2019t want to try to mess you with the stories that I've heard a lot of best of. Cindy, you got any comments there? Cindy Sanborn : Yes David, I think we are always looking for efficiencies where we hand off car whether to the joint facility and then this car rail or IHP in Chicago and there's nothing that really jumps off the page but as we've said many, many times everything's on the table and if we can find opportunities, we will certainly take advantage of them. David Vernon : But do you think there are any sort of constraints because you're tied to a schedule that maybe the Conrail serving for, that means both your and the Norfolk needs and it's harder to change or is that something that's probably not an issue? Cindy Sanborn : That's really not an issue. It's in all of our best interest to serve our customer better and they just simply supply the last mile service and do a very good job of it and we work very closely together on making sure that the efficient and effective for customers. David Vernon : Okay. And Fredrik, may be just as a quick follow-up, when you look at same store sales pricing, I hear your comments on mix in coal and I think what I've heard is where we should expect that to continue to happen but I think in the intermodal merchandise the deceleration in the core price, is that something that we should also expect to kind of happen here or we starting to see some signs of improvement in that domestic intermodal market that would help kind of assure that number? Fredrik Eliasson : Well, this is just to clarify also and I am not sure that will really go to a question. The mix was obviously out of the same store sale number, which is why we are doing it. In fact, once again we don't forecast price but I think it's clear that we've been in a place over the last few years where there's been a fair amount of exits capacity in the marketplace and all our customers as Hunter alluded before have alternatives, so we have got a price-to-market. The key thing is, is I look forward now between what I think you guys write a lot about which is that there's a structural change coming and closing an attractable market with some of the ELD limitations and the shortage of drivers and hopefully getting to better placement and capacity perspective. And coupled that, what we're doing with this operating model where I already see a significantly improved service. I think there's an opportunity as we move into '18 to really capitalize on that. So we feel good about where we are, we've priced the market each and every day and as we move forward we will do the same. David Vernon : But many as everything I worry are right now are we starting to see things kind of improve sequentially or we're still kind of in a soft patch on the domestic market? Fredrik Eliasson : I see some opportunities on the stock market side I follow closely where things seems to be moving in the right direction. I do think that obviously if you see some of the -- and you thought this more than I do on the trucking side as there has been some challenges out there but I see that the light is coming close at the end of the tunnel and supply and demand should be getting to a better place as we move through the second half of the year end and take thing. David Vernon : All right. Thanks very much for the time, guys. Fredrik Eliasson : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Bascome Majors : Yes. Thanks for fitting me in here. Just real quickly on the attrition rate, can you guys help quantify that for us whether in percentage terms or the number of people per year? Hunter Harrison : I think they were working on some numbers for me and let me clarify something that I'm trying to, we all have kind of dramatically a different type of explanations for, I'm talking about contractors, consultants, employees, all of the above everybody to get the cheque. Okay, I think that I'll correct this if I'm wrong, that the attrition is going to come in at that 9% level range, 8.5% to 9%. And so, if you look at those numbers as opposed to where we are, you use some kind of order or magnitude of what we get absorb without adversely affecting people. Bascome Majors : Yes. Thank you for that and Hunter as we take a step back, if you look recently at least, management canters have been based in the short term on operating income in the longer term on a mix of ROA. And as you in the reconstituted board looked at the outcomes you want to drive over the next four years, is there a change to that coming? How do you want to incentivize this in your management team to accomplish what you want to accomplish? Hunter Harrison : Well yes, I think that quarterly, look, I am not obsessed for example with the operating ratio. The more I try to get away from it the more people push me back in the middle of it. I mean clearly there's some, there are issues that are return on your name it, capital equity that whatever there are more material ways over a longer timeframe to look. The problem gets to be as we're incorporated into your yearly, daily operation and make the conversion because there is a lag period that you go through. I think a lot of businesses and I think we are a little bit that we have to address is this, we've got our compensation system so complex the employees won\u2019t understand it, I mean you have gone too far but I think that's something that the board talked about this week it happens facing committee discussed it and I think it's something that we want to be sure that we are motivating the right behavior with the employees of return effectively on caption. One of the rules of this model is this, they'll spend $1 in precious capital and so your growth been explore every operating alternative. And so, I think there's going to be a push that way more and more for return numbers than rather than just roll margins on operating ratio. Bascome Majors : Into that point, I'm sorry? Fredrik Eliasson : But once I get, on the you have talked about the long term being ROA. ROAs half of it and operating ratio has got the other half of it. I just want to make sure you knew both of it. Bascome Majors : Appreciate it. Is there a possibility for a free cash flow component, is that something you guys are considering? Hunter Harrison : Yes, free cash flow works. I mean, in all of the above, it\u2019s how you weigh those factors, and if you do you do those things in a material manner. Everyone has got some downside too. You focus this year on free cash flow and you make some inventory decision to make some artificial goal which deals you next year. So, it really takes a material approach from management and sometimes that\u2019s hard to put together. Frank Lonegro : And certainly a focus on cash is important as you saw in the quarterly financial report we put out last night and the guidance we put out and we're certainly being transparent in terms of free cash flow and how we are calculating it and what the goals are for the year. So that's a new thing for us. Bascome Majors : Hunter and Frank, thank you for the color here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. You may ask your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you operator. Hunter welcome back. Everyone else hello. Couple of quick things Hunter, looking at intermodal clearly it's an opportunity in the East. In your eyes, what's the most important piece of intermodal and how to get it more profitable for the railroad? Hunter Harrison : Well I mean clearly, it's pretty simple formula. Cindy talked about this morning and the longer the train, but here the train, the lower the cost the better we can be in the terminal. And the service factor, that\u2019s how you get to do. Get personal, get the toiler, get the container get it on the train, get it to its destination and get it on the ground and have it available for the customer. And it\u2019s not so much, if you do the job right and this organization has done a pretty good job there. I mean I look at some of our numbers that I am learning and with our domestic business we are like up in the mid or higher 90s which is pretty admirable with pretty demanding customer as they should be demanding. Like UPS, I mean UPS, just all I want you to do is right what we say intermodal if they were to stay under it. You say you are going to be here third morning, x/x, be here. And if you do that, okay, it's not sometimes we make these things too complex and you simply get it to move it, do what you say you are going to do it and be efficient with. Are we looking at some time saving that we can do little bit here and little bit there continually but I think we are going to do fine there, we are going to get even better there but and then we'll at the same time take advantage of this merchandize network. Jason Seidl : And Hunter, is the offering is big it needs to be? Does any investment beyond the typical investment that goes and it needs to be made at intermodal? Hunter Harrison : Well I mean Fredrik and probably and Frank can speak to that better than I can. I know that, look I know this company is going to be in a much better position from a base stand point that if we see the opportunity we are ready to make whatever investments we need to take advantages of opportunities in the market out there. Frank Lonegro : Yes and we talked about it before over the time. In terms of the network itself, we're 95% double stack clear which is a critical as opposed to driving efficiencies. We are opening one new customer in a live space that we felt was needed which is in Pittsburgh in July and we are looking at longer term terminals that we announced in Carolina the CSX terminal we talked about and we are also to Hunter\u2019s point earlier trying to see where their opportunities to leverage existing facilities and have perhaps combined things to create value that way. So, Hunter have been a great supporter in the franchise in what we are trying to do. And the essence of precision railroading is about running a scheduled network at a high level reliability and that is what we have been doing and we are going to do it more so going forward. Jason Seidl : All right. I've look at my follow-up. Hunter, let me hear your opinions on CSX the rest of the rail industry pushing towards one-man crews and when do you see that as a viable option? Hunter Harrison : I am not a one-man crew advocate. Now, there are special circumstances, there are different issues, I mean clearly if you're switching a race track or you're switching a mine track with one track or something, there's applications that we have today for one person. But today to take a 20,000 ton train on line of road with one person, I don't think it\u2019s good business. Then why I don\u2019t think that and shame on us that we don't have in my view the quality control to do it. So you have got one person on the train and you have a air hose failure or a drill bar or whatever, as the one person going to deal with the delays of the customers the domino effect and all that and then in some of that go hearts, tell me well, we're going to have people in trucks along the ride away with all these materialism and now they'll be dispatched to the train to help the engineer, the one-man crew and as said well it's not one and then it's one point whatever piece, particularly the day with where rail is relative to take the issues and the whole issue commentary obligation. I just don't think that it's something that we're focusing on. If you look at the payload, and people will shudder what I say this, when my peers with labor leaders if you look at the cost of the other person on that train that's has gotten rid of the payload of X, it's relatively drop in the bucket that the value of that person can bring as an additional eyes and ears and you came watch both sides of the train. And just, we've got a lot of things in the ABCs that we need to get better it before we start talking about one-man crew, then I guess before we total with that, we'll have -- we run the electric train with nobody up there with somebody with a reason is somewhere around it. I don\u2019t know having go and get the demand but I had figured out more, so. Jason Seidl : All this and I appreciate the thoughts as always. Thank you for your time. Hunter Harrison : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird. You may ask your question. Ben Hartford : Thanks for fitting me in. Hunter, I am just curious about your, we've talked a lot about intermodal on the call but curious about your go-to-market perspective on that the focus has been on the operational side and improving service and efficiency for the customers but if you think about being innovative and creative and flexible as you see CSX's IMC partnerships, do you see opportunities to expand into new partnerships with new IMCs or even kind of even kind of go more direct to market on the intermodal side as you think about a marketing strategy. Do you have any perspective on that? Thanks. Hunter Harrison : Under certain circumstances I think all work. I think there is a lot of things that we can do intermodaly that for whatever reason they may try before and it's then got away from it, but am a big as it could have be as repricing. One of the things that you have to do in our model which you'll hear a lot about is balance. And when you look at the graph, the intermodal for instance and it's kind of survive more lend and it keeps showing very denied and then it sync down on Sunday, it's just money that's being wasted. And I tried one experiment. When you hear, you listen to the market and you listen and you hear service, service. And so, we say, well we haven\u2019t run three trains on Friday night, so maybe we can discount on Saturday and Sunday to move some of that business from Friday to Saturday and Sunday. And so, we discounted 15% and 20%. Just how many people came Friday? Nobody. Everybody went Saturday and Sunday. So, you start to find out what the real market is out there. So, there is a lot of creative things I can see today, that we are going to have dispatch or sitting there at two o'clock in afternoon selling the slots. Then I get eight slots left that are going to be opened in less and they are going to discount. I see that my personal view is we will see a day where there won't be full contracts as such as we think about. They will be half but there will be shorter even in late and so I think there is a lot of things to do the way we compensate sales people, for example. And lot of things that rail can do that we can't, I mean, will stuck in the mud with that we can be much more creative to supplement this standard and low product. Ben Hartford : Thanks for that, best of luck. Hunter Harrison : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Your line is open, you may ask your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and congratulations on a strong part of the year. Fredrik, I wonder if you could talk about after margin how you feel that the volume with for 2017 versus how you felt that the time at Q4 call and just what influence that had and the team confidence in providing 2017 guidance this morning. Fredrik Eliasson : Sure. I would say that coming out of the I guess election, I am not sure it has anything to do with it but at the end of the year we did see little bit of up take in our volume and our projections through the year. I'm not sure that it's transferred into the macro numbers at this point but we did see a little bit more volume and perhaps who anticipated at the beginning of the year. We obviously also saw a coal market on the export side that improved beyond what we had anticipated originally even though we still expect it to taper off as we moved through the year. So, I would say that there is probably a slight increase in topline projection but it really isn't the foundation for what we did here in terms of the guidance that incremental change. It is the item that what we have done here over the last quarter or so to put ourselves in the position coupled with Hunter's arrival here and his operating model that has allowed us to do this. Cherilyn Radbourne : Okay. So, it's more the operational side then. Hunter Harrison : Which Cherilyn, gives the flow through obviously to the bottom line. Cherilyn Radbourne : Right. And then just a quick one on CapEx, you have adjusted down by about 5% for 2017, can you just talk about what you've already found room to trim there? Frank Lonegro : Sure, so you are right. We started out the year with about 1.97 billion in core capital meeting before you get the positive train control. We trimmed little over a 100 million from that number as we gave you the free cash flow numbers for the year. What we really did was we looked at all of the network investments and then to pause some of those given the fact that we are making terminal changes operating plan changes we have higher expectations for service products and so we really got to give that sometime to sync in before we decide exactly where we want to deploy some of that network capital. And then, on some of the return seeking projects to the point Hunter made earlier, we really looked at ways that we can get there through better process, better execution of that process and better accountability etcetera. So, we found some opportunity on both of those category. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thank you, that's all from me. Operator : Thank you. And next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC. You may ask your question. Walter Spracklin : Yes, thanks very much and welcome back Hunter. Hunter Harrison : Hi, Walt. Walter Spracklin : My question is on the free cash flow and how that's going to go into your buyback program leverage. I know you announced $1 billion new program here but I know how you've always liked your buyback. Leverage doesn't seem to be an issue at all and if I don't know if you huddled with Frank here little bit and talked about longer term where you want to see your leverage ratio go to and as a result and with the free cash flow you are going to generate from your initiatives. Could we see a much more expanded buyback in the billion dollar announcement here this morning? Hunter Harrison : Well Frank spent a lot of time this week with the board and the finance committee and I have believe it or not got the back up from that discussion and be a little more operating focused and let me let Frank help you there. Frank Lonegro : Yes, we had a great discussion this week and obviously you have heard us reiterate the BBB+/Baa1. Today you saw the size of the program for the next 12 months obviously as we get more and more monthly quarters under our belt and we get an understanding of the free cash flow numbers both for coming quarters and coming years. We'll take a hard look at whether or not we are deploying the capital in the correct way to shareholders in the correct amounts and we always look at the balance sheet and try to determine what the appropriate place is given really the cyclicality of the business on the merchandise and intermodal side as well as the capital intent for the business and making sure we preserve the access to the marketplace that we need in tougher time. So, we want to stress test the numbers that we have internally to make sure if there is in fact a holding line or any can see decline that we can stomach that. So, we think we are on pretty good shape with good numbers up for you in the quarter and the forward guidance as well as the buyback and the dividends. So, right now we feel like in pretty shape. Hunter Harrison : Yes. Also, I don't think our policy going to be different than what we you have been familiar with, okay. If you look at allocation basal, the first call is going to be always reinvestment in this railroad and hopefully we got opportunities to make the appropriate returns there. If those don\u2019t present their self, then we're going to look at other ways the most efficient ways as Frank described to return that case to the owner, whether it's through buyback, dividend, combinations thereof, will always be a little debated about what your structure is and what kind of fund you are managing and which customers want which. But I think we, I think the board yesterday had our both for two days estimating these and the board meeting, that a third discussion of our policies there and there was a great deal of common understanding in directionally which way we need to go. Walter Spracklin : Okay. This is the second question here is on the competitive response to your initiatives both from a service standpoint but also from a operating standpoint as you get lower cost, your ability to more efficiently and higher profitability services for customers. And I am just interested in what the competitive response might be that might cause problems for you Hunter, in terms of what you're trying to achieve. I know you've always had a great view on pricing, the pricing is what the market dictates but often we hear when market share shifts, they want it on price. So, is there a risk that a competitive response might come in and may put problems on how you can effect change or make them a little longer to achieve at the end of the day? Do you have any views on that? Hunter Harrison : Yes. Then they ought to be careful. If that's the response, look, as I think it's just pretty simple response. As long as we provide the service we talk about today and we become and we are going to get there the low cost carrier, okay, we got to worry about to tell you. I don't know what they are going to do in the way of response that is smart, is they can do that first. After competitors doing things stupid, that's good. And sometimes it's short term pain but I don't think that I'd see anything out there but this they are going to have some different response than they've had six months ago than what they are going to have in the future that's going to set this organization back. We get an agenda, we have got a wonderful customer base, we are going to see some organic growth. I'm convinced we're going to see some market share growth. I got to be a little patient there but this is going to come together. And I don't think a lot of what takes places is going to be negatively impacted by the competition. Walter Spracklin : Is there, there is a view out there that it can be emulated that some of your initiatives can just be copied and the efficiency you achieve can be followed by your competitors or anything you'd respond to that with regards to what you're doing and a unique way you are doing it that will make it more difficult for the competition to copy you? Hunter Harrison : Couple of that would. It's on eBay for a $1000, I mean, it's the market, if not then we can't get it recopy that some of the competition used to work for all of those to get copy rights business. It's not secret, okay. It's one thing to write its play book, okay. A lot of companies keep sitting down and give you yes and no, okay. The key is you got to have players that can execute. You don\u2019t have to play, you're going to execute. You steal every play but you all. So, I hope they do copy but if they copy us, I think they might be more efficient and I'll look at other rails generally speaking much more is our partners is our near competitor. Of course, we had so much airline business too here. So, we have that. The secrets in this, I miss them. Walter Spracklin : Fair enough, thanks very much. Hunter Harrison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. You may ask your question. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks, good morning. Hunter, I was curious, just your comment taking two to three days out of the Chicago Jacksonville route, I'm curious what type of time it would take to do such a thing and is that unique because the Chicago should we expect that more broadly then? Hunter Harrison : Well, that's I think you expect it broadly. If you look at the overall velocity, I mean, I just used Chicago for an example and how quick can you see it, you can see it overnight. I mean, we are starting to reach schedules at railroad, I know that the main company has gotten especially Florida pretty well reworked and done and that\u2019s been I've been doing some looking, work for towards and on. And so, we're going to kind of go up the line, we will have what you have been used to before with every guy have its own trip plan. One plan, they only get re-tripped and re-tripped, you got one plan, we got to tell the customers going to be 83 hours door-to-door and we're going to do it. And one of the ways to do it is this. Look, I -- we've get a lot of good things going, we got some things, we got to say. Our train speed is not right out of it, our merchandise train speeds between terminals is like 18 miles an hour. We got the potential to be at 27, 28, and you start taking numbers like that and then you avoid terminals and rather than drive into a terminal and dwell for 26 hours you can drive by that one and skip that 26 and pick up a little here and you do the math and don\u2019t take long, you get to Florida two or three days quicker depending on where at large you are going. That's just an order of magnitude that impact both service and cost and asset turns and all of the stuff is good. Scott Schneeberger : Great, thanks. And then just some of the -- with regards to this year's operating ratio guidance, what is the one big bucket item that you think could where you could outperform and then maybe a bucket item where you are most nervous where you may underperform? Thanks. Hunter Harrison : That's how way late wake at night worry about that in that regard. If something happens that I'm not aware of or there is some geopolitical or something happens in Washington or something like that but I mean this is a pretty simple formula of there something that most of us have been in our whole life and they'll have to do this railroad, and that's how we got to do to get these things accomplished. Now, I mean obviously look, people, when you take a 1000 people as an organization, that's a bit hit. It's a big saving right there. That's a lot of it, but the other thing that you look at, the rail cars, the train starts, the start and the yard starts with the closest to the hub. All those things, those are natural that kind of about working capital will be then go -- we weren\u2019t going to be with the best part for some of these entirely. Retires, and these old up gear, they don\u2019t like them anymore. So, we have moved a lot of profit there but this is going to happen. Scott Schneeberger : Great, thanks. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Duran Marabala with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, you may ask your question. Duran Marabala : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Hunter, I guess just one question from me on the revenue side. I am wondering, is there any sort of revenue that you see on the book of business that maybe doesn't meet the return thresholds and maybe needs to be demarcated. I know some of that did happen with CP sort of early on in the process there. Thank you. Hunter Harrison : No. Look, there is some odds and ends that just pops every once a while with the individual move or something. Everybody goes through a little bit of that, but generally speaking I mean for instance then maybe they're here to point those kind of things out and obviously if they were there and I was coming, you might have been motivated to get them out of there. You have to and so no we are not going to demark and we're looking at marking. Duran Marabala : Thank you, that's helpful. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may ask your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. I know it's still early but I was wondering if you could talk about any structural changes to the network that we could see this year as it relates to divestitures of non-core assets and when thinking about that mid-60s OR guidance for 2017, does that include the impact of any real-estate gains? Hunter Harrison : The second part, no we don't include any real-estate gain. The real-estate gain is it where they are and that's been discussed internally, are all gravy but I can tell you that the experience in the past, there are lots of opportunity up there, even now in Chicago. And it's a big number in my book and it's something that we will be sensitive to and talk to about. It's not going to drive the business but it certainly going to be in the bucket and the blender when we make certain operating decisions about where we operate from and locate and let me make sure I understood the first part of the question. Justin Long : Just asking about the potential for divestitures at some points in this year, maybe some short line assets that you would view as being non-core to the franchise? Hunter Harrison : There is not anything. Look, there is a lot of initiatives going on here that I am sure that I am not even aware of yet that but to my knowledge there is nothing of any large metrics that we are looking at what we\u2019ve been both the knowledge just getting better what we do with the franchise that we have. Justin Long : Okay. And secondly, Hunter you made the comment earlier that this franchise has more potential than any other you've dealt with. With that in mind do you think there is a path for this business to have industry leading margins or do you think there are structural limitations getting to an OR level that we've recently seen from the Canadian route. Hunter Harrison : No, I think you can have the industry leading margins, I think you will have. The only issue there in massive world is if I can get all that done before I have to go, I'd like to be here to cut the ribbon, that's kind of big deal it's just a little personal goal but there is no reason that structurally certain I know knowing that this railroad it can now become the greatest road in north America. If it's greatest in North America, it's probably greatest in the world. And let me just [indiscernible] people look at this. I went to Canada the first time as an American and meant not fun to begin with, but I got there and seeing it just can do with great restructuring coming out of that deal and it's impressive numbers but the one thing they did is a problem, do not expect the Canadian railroad to ever achieve numbers like the US rail, it's just not structurally possible until our operating ratio went to the leading operating ratio in North America. And then just what the US roads did. The US roads did, look we're going to improve but don't think we are ever going to reach the level of the Canadian road, it's just not structurally possible. So, it's got something new with what you're paid for exists and where do you reside, but it's the same vein, that whole board up here does mean that much. Justin Long : Okay, great. I appreciate the time and we are all looking forward to watching this play out. Hunter Harrison : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. You may ask your question. Brian Konigsberg : Hey, good morning. Thanks for bidding me in and welcome Hunter. And just almost all my questions have been answered. I think an award is deserved for many of the analysts still coming up with stuff this late into the call. But I guess just the one thing just for the model sake, obviously Hunter you've got an employment contract that has been stamped and we're still waiting for the result of the shareholder meeting. We'll expect that to go through most likely. So, how should we be baking in kind of the share grants and additional payment set have been agreed upon so far throughout this year in cash flows and into these share baseline? Hunter Harrison : Yes. I'm not sure that it's appropriate for me to address that, let me let Frank address that. Frank Lonegro : So, in terms of the share based compensation, obviously we book expense on that one onto the Black-Scholes model and we've done that in terms of the guidance that we've given you. In terms of the shareholder vote, obviously you heard David's opening remarks and we're not going to touch on that one. But the free cash flow number that we gave you for the year is excluding the existing restructuring charges and any subsequent restructuring charges that might happen in the second quarter. Brian Konigsberg : And so just presumably the share count could does not reflect any grants at this point but that can certainly change at their shareholder meeting. Is that -- I am just saying the share grants, I presume it's not in the numbers now and likely not in the guidance that was provided but that could change after the shareholder meeting that could be baked in our next discussion if it's approved. Frank Lonegro : The numbers we gave you, the around $1.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow excludes the cash impact of the things that we're discussing both in the first quarter and perhaps things that could happen subsequently in the second quarter. Is that cleared now? Brian Konigsberg : Yes. I could follow-up on that offline but that helps. Thank you. Frank Lonegro : Okay. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude the question and answer session. At this time, I will turn the call over to Hunter Harrison for closing remarks. Hunter Harrison : Well, thanks very much for joining us in a very simulating goal. Hopefully, we have answered all your questions. And I got a rental key. So, if you'll excuse me. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. David Baggs : Thank you, Marcella, and good morning everyone. On behalf of the management team, I would like to welcome you to our quarterly earnings call, and also thank you for your interest in CSX Corporation. Our presentation, our quarterly financial report and our press release which conveyed our results expanded buyback program and reaffirm 2017 guidance are all available on our website at csx.com in the investor section. In addition later today, a webcast replay of this presentation as well as our 10-Q will be posted on that same websites. This morning CSX is being represented by its Chief Executive Officer, Hunter Harrison; our Chief Operating Officer; Cindy Sanborn; our Chief Marketing Officer, Fredrik Eliasson; and our Chief Financial Officer, Frank Lonegro. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking statement disclosure. Any statements about the future made during presentation or during Q&A should be taken in the full context of this disclosure. Turning to Slide 3 is our non-GAAP disclosure and while CSX files all of its financial in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we are providing certain non-GAAP measures to give you a more wholesome understanding of the business. These measures should be taken in the full context of this disclosure and with the understanding that they are not a substitute for GAAP. Finally, we are close to 30 analysts covering the CSX. I would encourage everyone to limit their questions to one primary and one secondary question. And with that, it is my great pleasure and privilege to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Hunter Harrison. Hunter? Hunter Harrison : Thank you, David. Welcome everyone. It's nice to be here with you some beautiful downtown Jacksonville. I'm going to limit now the remarks this morning and let Frank and Fredrik should be take the heavy load initially, and I'm sure we are going to have a vigorous Q&A session, and I'll let most of my remarks or observations during that period. I would say this I trusted you with the press release. I hope you will read the same one. I thought we had a hell of a quarter, four months, we have been after this and a lot of has been done, a lot of has been accomplished. Directionally, I am very pleased with the direction the organization has taken. Although, I think maybe certainly in some quarters, and I understand that, your expectations were pretty high, which used to be -- I'll talk a moment you don't even make the cut anymore. So, I'm going to be interested obviously in some of the Q&A and I do think that, as a result of this to some degree, I think we are going to change the format of how we announce earnings in the future. And I think we will go more to the conventional approach of releasing our earnings ahead and the call effectively simultaneously because I think it does create some awkwardness in that some of you still remember the night before. You have questions we have able to respond to some of those questions or you might get all of them. We didn\u2019t talk to anybody last night and I just kind of mopped the tears up a little bit and there is all. So, I think it will put us in a situation where you not having to make observations in the dark and it will make our work here much easier in distributing this information to the shareholder, which is really the important thing we're dealing with here. So with that said, let me return this over to conductor, Frank, and let him proceed with the presentation. Frank Lonegro : Good thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks Hunter. Slide 7 reviews our safety service and efficiency performance year-over-year. You can see our train accident performance improved slightly while our personal injury frequency index rose to 1.14, reflecting a slight increase in injuries in a significant fleet to fewer number of man hours. The safety of our employees is paramount and our commitment to them is unwavering. Cindy Sanborn : And let me jump in, Frank, even though we express injury performance in numerical terms on the slide, safety is always about returning employees home at the end of their tour duty. Tragically, we had two employees who were killed in an accident that occurred in Washington D.C. in the quarter. Our condolences go out to the family of Stephen Deal and Jake LaFave as we mourn the loss two of our colleagues. It is a stark reminder that even though railroads are one the safest industries in North America, they can also be very unforgiving one and our commitment to safety remain. Frank Lonegro : Thank you, Cindy. Service and efficiency measures are turning well year-over-year due to train length reflects two initiatives that offset one another in the quarter, both are integral to Precision Scheduled Railroading. The first is balance. We have expanded the days of service on most trains to seven days per week, which is instrumental to improving cycle time and after utilization, but negatively impacts train length. The second is unit train conversations into the scheduled merchandized network, which reduces both asset and resource intensity, and increases train length. Going forward, you should see train length increase sequentially. Dwell and velocity of both improved and reflect the early success of Precision Scheduled Railroading. These improvements are particularly noteworthy given the rapid pace of change we're driving. Balancing the train plan, merging unit trains into the scheduled network and converting for flat switching has reduced handlings, improves transit times and improve velocity, and allowed us to idle 26,000 freight cars and 900 engines. Cindy can certainly provide more color during the Q&A on those items. Fuel efficiency has also improved year-over-year with 900 fewer engines and service and a more fuel efficient active fleet. Turning to Slide 8, we\u2019re encouraged by the financial results driven by the early implementation of Precision Scheduled Railroading. Revenue was up 8% driven primarily by core pricing gains of 3.7% all in and 2.2% excluding coal, volume growth of 2% and higher fuel recoveries. We also had liquidated damages of 58 million in the quarter, which reflects the resolution of a longstanding dispute. It is recorded in the other revenue line and drives the year-over-year variants. GAAP expenses were up 6% and down slightly excluding the restricting charge. Efficiency savings of $90 million more than offset the impact of inflation in the quarter. Looking at the detail, labor and fringe was favorable reflecting 2,200 fuel resources. As Hunter discussed on the first quarter call, we have also begun to address the size of our contractor workforce with savings following through the MS and other line. On that line, we also concluded a decade plus condemnation proceeding, resulting in $55 million of favorability. Fuel expense was higher reflecting a 15% price increase. Strong revenue gains combined with cost control drove very strong incremental margins. Reported EPS was $0.55 with the 67.4 operating ratio. Adjusting for the restructuring charge, EPS was $0.64 for the 63.2% operating ratio. The reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is in the appendix with these materials. Slide 9 illustrates that our free cash flow generation continues to improve, given in large part by three things. Strong top line gains, cost control and reduce to capital intensity. Our success in generation free cash flow has enabled us to increase our shareholders distributions year-over-year with over 750 million of share buybacks year-to-date, including nearly 500 million in quarter two. And you can also see the effect of our recent $0.02 dividend increase. The Company's improved financial performance is reflected in our trailing 12-month ROIC of 10% nearly a four point better than last year. Finally, adjusted EBITDA ratio remains stable as higher earnings offset the impact of additional debt. Turning to Slide 10, the third quarter volume outlook shows nearly three quarters of our business is expected to be favorable and neutral. Export coal demand remains strong and we now expect to ship around 30 million tons for the year. The revenue per unit will moderate sequentially as the global benchmarks come down. Consumer sentiment remains positive driving intermodal growth in the third quarter. As a reminder, in August, we will cycle the shortfall domestic interchange loss we've mentioned previously. We expect continued economic growth as well as a tightening truck market, which should support growth in several of our merchandize markets. On the left side of the ledger, a few of our markets will experience year-over-year volume declines in the third quarter due to market specific headwinds you're very familiar with. Auto shipments will be impact by softening production, as reflected in the forward views of North American light vehicle production. Crude oil trends have essentially gone to zero more than offsetting the growth we expect in the core chemicals markets. And domestic coal remains challenged due in large part to the impact of the shortfall competitive loss as of January the 1st. Before I wrap up on Slide 11, two housekeeping items, one our fiscal year will now tie to the calendar, as a result the third quarter of 2017 will have one more day than the third quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we will have one more day than the comparable 13-week fourth quarter of 2016. Also a result of a recent state tax law change, our effective tax rate for the third quarter will be between 39% and 40%, as we revalue the deferred tax liability for that particular state. Now to Slide 11, we're up to a good start to 2017. Our first half performance provided this team with continued confidence in our full-year expectations and we are reaffirming that guidance today. Excluding restricting and assuming no weak genomic or coal related disruptions, we are on track to deliver a mid-60s operating ratio, record efficiency gains, EPS growth of around 25% and free cash flow of around $1.5 billion. With that backdrop, the CXS Board of Directors has authorized a 500 million increase to the share repurchase program, bringing the total authorize program to $1.5 billion. We are continuing to evaluate the optimal capital structure and cash performance strategy for the Company and are committed doing investment grade profile. We are excited to host our 2017 Investor Conference on October 29th and 30th at Palm Beach and look forward to sharing with you our multiyear strategy and associated financial partners. With that, we would be delighted to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin conducting a questions-and-answer session. Our first question, one moment, our first question will be from Brian Ossenbeck of JP Morgan. Brian Ossenbeck : So, you mentioned in the press release that, there is some impairments on PTC about $10 million or so. So I just wanted to get, if there is opportunity to talk more probably about that system. How you stand right now, if you\u2019re seeing any implementation effects and why you took the impairment? And overall, what sort of OpEx you\u2019re running through the P&L this year? And how you expect that to progress over the next couple of years? Frank Lonegro : Hi Brian, it's Frank, thanks. In terms of the impairments about half of the 10 million impairments were in positive train control. The others were in literally smattering of technology projects that are necessarily consistent with Precision Scheduled Railroading and so we stop those. Back to the PTC, half of the equation, that was really divided into two parts. As we\u2019ve reduced the locomotive fleets and don't have plans to bring those back, some of the labor side that did on those engines for PTC won\u2019t be necessary. And therefore, we have to pull it out of the capital plan and roll it through the P&L. The other part was some signal design work that we did on portions of the railroad, based on the traffic flows that we anticipate as well as the THI flow that we anticipate. We won\u2019t necessary be upgrading those to PTC so we had to roll those through as well. We\u2019ll continue to look at things obviously impairments are somewhat unusual. We don\u2019t have those on a routine basis. But as we look at the capital plan, don\u2019t follow, and as we look at the PTC footprint going forward and then maybe some, I don\u2019t know with any right now but there may be some. In terms of your OpEx question, I know there has been a lot of commentary on that recently based on some statements by CN this year in the UP. Let me tell you where we are from an OpEx perspective. Our OpEx on PTC has been ramping up for several years. Our full year 2017 will be a $150 million. Now that is the cumulative impact of a ramp up since about 2009 on the OpEx side. And the cash piece of that is about one-third, the depreciation piece of that is about two-thirds. When you look at the cash piece, it\u2019s really as our corporate phone bill goes up because it\u2019s a very heavy communications type system that phone bill keeps going up. So, we\u2019ve got some piece of that in hardware, software and maintenance and support, as we go forward would be the other part with cash piece. We likely will have a terminal run rate in 20-20 of around $200 million to $250 million. And again, I think that's split between depreciation and cash expenses will be roughly the same. And Cindy can talk about where we are on the project. Cindy Sanborn : Yes, we\u2019re about 40% of our PTC miles are in service at this point. We feel very comfortable that we\u2019ll have a majority of our -- certainly our commitment by 2018 to be hardware complete and continued implement of subdivisions, as we progress from this year and next year and into the 20-20. Brian Ossenbeck : Thanks frank. I know you\u2019ve spent a lot of time on PTC in the prior role. So just to confirm it 200 to 250 kind of annual rate split between OpEx and D&A, so it\u2019s kind of an all-in expense costs given the network? Frank Lonegro : And Brian just to tell you, it's kind of a terminal run rate and like 2020 or 2021. Brian Ossenbeck : Right, right. Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up on the high level market view. We\u2019ve seen the U.S. dollar on a trade-weighted basis basically declined ever since the beginning of the year. I think it\u2019s down almost 7% or 8%, as we stand right now year-to-date. So, Fredrik, what -- what are you seeing in terms of the various puts and takes after the obvious in export coal? When does that decline start to become more of a benefit and start to show up and grabs some more exports and probably fewer disruptive imports? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, I think we\u2019ve been encouraged to see other fact that IDP to begin with is showing a little bit of strength versus what we've seen in the last couple of years. And clearly part of that is also the dollar has helped some of the U.S. exporters. You paid on the export coal side clearly a weaker dollar helpful there. And I think as we look at some of the other markets, we will see some of those benefits. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a lot of it yet, but anytime we have a little bit of weaker dollar, it does help them. So, I do expect to see that as we move forward. Operator : Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Your line is open. Chris Wetherbee : Hi, great. Thanks. Good morning. Hunter, I want to touch a little bit on sort of expectations and maybe cadence of improvement. Your points earlier were well received in terms of peoples. The expectations that what we might see this quarter, but maybe you could help us sort of understand a little bit, how some of the changes that you\u2019ve been implementing early on in the process here. Ultimately, play out sort of in the physical world in terms of closing hump yards, obviously working with the employee group and generating that productivity. Just wanted to get a sense of maybe how we can start thinking about that, as we move into the second half of the year? Hunter Harrison : I appreciate your question, Chris. That\u2019s good question, I was going to raise -- you have raised the question. One, you should think about sensitivity of your plan. When we make a operating decision to reduce expense or change the operation, say maybe in early April, we might not see the benefit net-net in the P&L still in August or September, depending on collective bargaining agreements, and depending on the tax treatment, and all those various things coming to play. So, we can take certain actions and we know exactly when those benefits will start kicking in. It\u2019s a little difficult and it\u2019s kind of for me here it\u2019s a learning experience. It\u2019s kind of different everywhere you go, but the trust of what we have talked about that we are trying to do, it hasn\u2019t changed at all. We\u2019re down -- and look after, I\u2019m not restricting my numbers to second quarter. This is just kind of where we stand today or where we see ourselves to return. We\u2019re down about 900 locomotives now it\u2019s certainly not over and probably clearly go to a 1,000. I\u2019m not sure where it\u2019s going to stop. We\u2019re now depending on the way you look at the way you whether you include store or not, but the way I look at it if you look at the active inventory, we\u2019re down about 60,000 freight cars from where we were earlier in the year of 200,000 again to 135,000 or 140,000. I think that we have emphasized that we -- this is more of the team and me, but I think from hump standpoint, I think we started off somewhere I think 12. The number is quite about some round. Humps and I think, we think we\u2019re going to end up probably within the next year. We\u2019ll end up with three, it could be two or it could be four, but in that range a significant drop in the number of humps. And I would add to that is that look, those humps that we\u2019ve taken had a service hump, doesn\u2019t mean we have to sell all the land and throughout the year and I'd hope t hat on day post-Harrison that this company is going. But we\u2019re going to see growth in the merchandise side where we did and maybe there be a time into the future. So you know we are going to keep hope on. We\u2019re not -- we\u2019re not having a dry sale here. I think that as result of some of those things, the capital spend over the next several years unless there is opportunity to come up and at this point I am aware of that we will come down pretty significantly from what has been in the plan forward. I think this year we are going to be down $500 million or so. Yes, there will be $100 million this year, when you look at year-over-year basis versus where we end up last year we close for $600 million. Somewhere in that neighborhood and I would expect, that\u2019s going to -- the reason that we\u2019re going to be able to take that all day obviously on locomotives, rolling stock and lot of things that going to support that. That\u2019s going to help obviously free cash flow, pretty significantly, which I think -- I think my personal view is, we should certainly have some influence on the board when they make the decision to authorize the additional buyback that if some will be done, financed internally and with operating expense reduction. Yes, we\u2019ll basically with one exception, all the operating metrics are trending and hitting in the right direction, very, very encouraging. If you are a headcount person, I think the headcount as we are seeing today -- I am not doing this quarter-over-quarter, but we stand today about I think 2,300 -- again that\u2019s now somewhere we are trying to set some record with, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if before the years that is a lot things come together that could be 3,000. So, when I look at that, I look at my past experience in this business, and I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s hell of course. I hated these amount of people, but I'd say that\u2019s all I guess and but there is other opportunities that we will for us. And the team is coming together, and clearly you\u2019re going to ask this question, so I\u2019ll try to address. What\u2019s the bigger challenge that we get? One of the bigger challenges we have is what I was talking to you about before and it\u2019s the change, it\u2019s the change, it\u2019s the cultural change, and that\u2019s difficult for organization to go further. And we are having a little bit there ourselves. And at all levels, you saw that, this was right prior to my arrival. So, I think I should refer that our friends in either way. I'm a neutral with just a 1,000 people, but I did take note that they were -- I think effectively all management people. There were no Indians if you were Indianan so we didn't take away from what was being done to the business plan. And I think our view going forward will put us in a position we don\u2019t have to replace those. Now, on the operate side, do we have a few guess, yes. If that's the address, yes, I think our human resource group along with Cindy and others here in the team are sensitive to that. I think we've recruited -- they know better than I, but 15 or so people that we think are top notch, high potential, very honest from various background and various locale. And so I think that there's something we can solve and deal with. And there's a lot of things in the bucket, so if I let with that, this is back and review and had a look at second quarter I got to be pretty excited and I got to be excited about third and fourth and three or four years out. You know the other plan, the live plan on this report is, you all said I couldn't get it done in four years and now you owe me because I can get it done in four months, so the bar's been raised here but I'm ready for the challenge. Chris Wetherbee : Sure enough, that's a very comprehensive and helpful answer, I appreciate that. You know the follow-up would just be in terms of initial customer reactions and sort of how you might think about the business from the volume standpoint, as you also progress through that sort of cost and operational efficiency efforts, as we go through the rest of the year. Have you been surprised? Has it been more negative or sort of more expected in terms of the reaction from customers? And sort of what you've been sort of pushing off the network potentially, as maybe some stuff has potentially moved competitively or otherwise? Just want to get a sense of how customers are sort of viewing that initial changes at the Company? Hunter Harrison : Well, let me comment and then I'll let Frederick comment. This is not -- it's not a lot different what I expected. You know customers are like other people, a lot of them don't like change. I've spent some time with them myself, it's hard to find with them on the telephone and face-to-face. And I've tried to explain to them where we're going, why we're going there, what's important about it. And to get there we have to go through this change. And so there's going to be a little pain and suffering. I don't know frankly how to get there without some busting road. This is not just something you could try to switch on. So, I think most of them, by far the majority are pretty sympathetic, I heard that some not bow out with them and look. We look forward to this changes coming in and we limited to suffer a couple of bruises along the way. Just don't bruise us up too much and I think with -- with a couple of exceptions, it's been typical of what you might think and expect. Look, nobody loves them okay, so we\u2019re going to have people out there in dollar and second guess, but I don't -- when the bottom-line comes to end, I don\u2019t think anybody is going to change businesses, plus or minus, they're doing that. They're going to do it, yes. If we provide this service, we talk about. If we make the improvement that we\u2019ve made, we\u2019ll be rewarded. If we don\u2019t, we won\u2019t and it\u2019s the way it works. I am not asking, we're not asking anybody going in the business just because we need it. We\u2019re going to work hard to earn it and I think we can -- I don\u2019t think any of those issues our instruments. Fredrik Eliasson : No, I mean I would say that I noticed about transit time and it\u2019s about reliability. And if we look at transit time as an example, if I look at the scheduled merchandized network and coal network and in all network, if I compare transit time here in the second quarter versus the fourth quarter, they\u2019re all improved and clearly will go through a lot of change. Cindy and my team are working through that with customers where we are impacting them specifically and trying to fine tune the operating model, and making sure that ultimately we reach with what Hunter, as we're clear about that we\u2019re going to get a better service product for our customer because, not only is that better for the customers, but it is also better for CSX. Operator : Next, we will take a question from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Your line is open sir. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, great. Good morning. So, Hunter, I just wanted to get a sense. Do you refer that I think all the metric to move in the right way except one. I don\u2019t know if the one you\u2019re referring to is well timed. But when I look at the dwell time at some of the yards, I see numbers that are kind of 40 to 50 hours which to me is unusual. You know, I normally think 20 to 30 hours kind of typical dwell time. I know you made pretty dramatic changes in converting hump yards to flat twitching. So, how would you characterize kind of the progression, you know. April and May were really good. June seemed to be a little bit of a pause. Are dwell time numbers that concern and how should we look at things in third quarter? Does that -- those numbers come down, so if you can just help us with the forward look and also what\u2019s happening in the dwell time, I would appreciate it? Thank you. Hunter Harrison : Sure. Tom, there's a lot of people who don't understand the dwell time in my view. In this model of ours scheduled precision railroading, the challenge is not to get the dwell time as well as we can go. It's the planned dwell time and you hit the place, so you don\u2019t hurry up and wait. Spend money you don\u2019t need to spend just to create some dwell 18 hours instead of 20, if there is no real through safest opportunity there. So, this is not how well you can go, this is look, let's just say, we're at 20 forward today or 5 and it was our -- but let\u2019s just say that, as we run all this plan out and say how should the cars dwell at these various tunnels, that continue to exist for example. And you say what kids dwell time need? Should it be 21 hours? Should it be 19 hours? What is the dwell time? Now, what some people on the outside looking indoor and saying, as they look at and say, the dwell time is up an hour, god, that\u2019s a horrible trend. So, wait a minute we\u2019re going through one terminal instead of three. So, we do really go through three terminals at 26 hours or one at 27. All they said, we're late and get in it and that's the dwell understanding. That's why we're trying to answer your question. So, now, as we said that, a lot of things as they dwell, if we have too many cars in inventory and if it's slow period business wise or if it\u2019s a holiday period. What happens to the cars? They dwell because there is not -- there is not a need, a demand for it. That\u2019s a little bit our fault by having maybe too many cars in supply chain to pipeline, whatever you might want to call it. But all those things effect dwell, so look there is going to be 4th July, although we would like people to work 365, they don't do it. We do. Can you imagine if the railroads did? We're going take every Saturday and Sunday off like normal people, and we\u2019re going to have our time off -- we're not at the work every day. The impact that it will have economically to this continent, I am telling you, I've seen numbers and that's enough to put us in a depression. I'll tell you that. So, we\u2019re going to have period with holidays. So, the dwell time as a gross number, we've known from 26 to 25 doesn't a concern me. Now, if I see, Tom, what you have mentioned 40 or 50 hours is certainly worth of the second load to be sure that we know why that is existing. Is it because of service failures? Is it because of operations that we're not doing? What we need to do? And then we will get in with those terminals and correct them. But when we get these the hump stop that\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean that the whole yard is going to close down. But I mean significantly may a place we're working 12 or 15 assignments, will go to two or three plus the fact that we don\u2019t have to replace the equipment and a lot of things that busted the humping operation. You will see the dwell time come down and that will come down because we can take the product down consistently. So, we're giving three days service and we do those things and we get to two and the dwell time will change to the standard of two, not what it was before. So that a little commentary of dwell. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, thank you. And second question would be on the -- I guess a full-year guidance when you consider the upside in second quarter -- if you including the $0.64, it seems that it's a conservative expectation for second half. I mean, assuming, just kind of putting some revenue numbers in, I get a, call it, 67 OR in second half, maybe 66.5, 67, which seems that it implies you wouldn't have much sequential improvement. I know there is seasonality, but I'm just wondering is it appropriate to say maybe there's some element of conservative in the full-year guide? Or is it appropriate to say, well, it just take some time to see the OR improve and don't expect a lot of sequential improvement in the second half? Hunter Harrison : Well, I think you have to be real sensitive to the timing. Now, I just kind made a case that a lot of actions we took in the second quarter, we haven\u2019t seen come to the bottom lines yet. But they are going to come to the bottom line in third and fourth quarter, and they are not in that headline. So, one of the things I think we're all doing, and I've done at everyone's turnaround is that, for lack of a better turn, we're dealing with the leap of faith. Because I am saying to the team when you do one thing, and they are saying we have never done it before, show me. So, we are going through that phase. And I'm pretty comfortable and I know Frank is shifting hips over here on as I start to say this. I'm very comfortable -- have I ever been wrong, I've been wrong before not many times, but I've been wrong. Then I think, if I know exactly where I guided to then we are going to be somewhere around -- if you talk about clean quarter then we could talk about all that. We are going to be in the range mid 60s, which could be 66, could be 60 forward. I think we are going to be in plus free cash flow. I think the earnings are going to be pretty damn good year-over-year. So, I think it's pretty realistic. What I do think is this I think we are all and me including short selling ourselves a little bit because we are really not seeing these recruits and some these cultural change. We are not really giving all the credit there. And those I mean we have brought a couple of people in. We think in this organization is -- but I'm telling you they have made huge different one individual, huge. Million dollar of difference, now you don\u2019t run upon it every day, okay, there is not a Michael Jordan on every street corner in Chicago or North Carolina. But if you can get more into that there, it really helps think I suppose to set up a group of player. Operator : Your next question is from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : I just wanted to follow up on the headcount. Hunter, you mentioned earlier you are taking -- today you stand at a reduction of about 2,300 employees. Does that include the 1,000 management positions that were --? Hunter Harrison : Yes. Allison Landry : And then Frank, on the contractors, could you -- how many do you guys currently have employed? Frank Lonegro : Well, we haven\u2019t published that number yet, but let me give you a sense of what we are going to do and then let me give you a sense of where we are. What we are looking to do and Hunter's given some really good guidance on this one is to, look at what can be in sourced economically and being able to absorb that over the existing employee population or do some sort of conversion factor two to one, three to one something like that where we can take two or three contracts out for every employee that we might add. So, you obviously see that flow through on the MS&O line. And then you may also see, I'll call it lesser degree of comp for employee takeout or comp for workforce takeout on the MS&O line, and then you might see on the labor line. What Hunter said on the first quarter call was, we would be down an incremental 1,000 in addition to the 1,000 that we did through the management restructuring. And that second 1,000 that we mentioned was going to be accommodation of management, union, and contractors, I would tell you that we are through that. We've made great progress and the Hunter's point around making him about a 3,000 number by the end of the year against the 2,300 where we are now. I mean we'll continue to work on all three of those elements through converting contractors. We'll look at the resources that we need in the field to run the operating fine, and we'll certain look at continuing to manage attrition as tightly as we can. So, I think all of those things continue to see sequential improvement in account. And as we get to a point where we had good year-over-year comparables for you on the contractors and consultants, we'll begin to publish that one, and it could be as early as the Investor Conference, but certainly be as of the first in the year. Hunter Harrison : Okay, let me in fact just add a little comment and context to that. And what I'm trying to encourage and organization is trying to do to absorb the business. If I go back one of our proudest moments was at Illinois Central. And we after some financial engineering and I became CEO, we settled in and we had a little railroad that had 3,000 employees in an 80 operating ratio. And two years later, we had 3,000 employees and we had an operating ratio of 62. The issue is this, it's not that it then people would say, what had you do there, what was it different? We allowed those 3,000 people to create value. We gave them opportunities and that's what that's a much better story. It's much better bottom line if you can say, look this is not about stripping heads out, it's just taking valuable people and allowing them to add value to the organization in the most effective, efficient way it can be done, by doing it with internal people, have to get in the buyouts and all this other stuff. So, that's kind of the road we hit in down. Allison Landry : Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Hunter, you also made some comments earlier, which I think were alluding to long-term share gains in merchandise. So I guess should we be thinking about that similar to where CP is now? In other words, does CSX eventually shift from a cost improvement story to a top-line growth story? And do you expect those share gains to come primarily from truck or are there any opportunities that you see for CSX to take share in merchandise from your competitor? Hunter Harrison : That's a hell of a question. Number one, yes, we want to see CSX for a while. Number two, one of the levers that'll help us grow is low cost and efficiency. So, there's going to be a continual drive and a hopefully compatibility between those two numbers. So that if we lose the sense of our cost, we lose the ability into -- we've to go to business as effective as we like. Where can we gain the all share, clearly in my views off the house. There is something in the competition and these folks remember better than I know more about that. But look, the focus is not at least in my view at this point, not the rail competition, it's the highway, okay. We kind of although we let jealousies getting here from times to time, we go to Canada and you said the three words depending on what part of country you in and people just go nuts. They're emotional about it. But the big opportunity is on the highway. We will have -- I think with those I just described is jump all business without competitors. They don't have railroads. Their good railroad is just competition and we will have non-compete. That\u2019s where I guess a good capital system thereabout. But the key is that we really and really gotten this service factor. We have to understand that. We have to appreciate that. We have to understand that it's difficult people change in to some degree. It's going to take along, but that\u2019s where a railroad the last 40 years, as last the big market share, that\u2019s the most probably all in, some of the most profitable business we have. And I'm not trying to say to you that, we are going to see some rapid growth over the next 15 or 16 months. And a lot of this will probably happen in the post-Harrison era. I think, if we do our job today in laying the foundation, there will be a lot of opportunities to grow. Operator : We have our next question from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, [ma'am]. Amit Mehrotra : Wanted to get a sense of the performance I guess in the quarter relative to your own expectations. You have kept full-year guidance unchanged. There's maybe over $100 million of benefit in the quarter that may be considered extraordinary in nature. If you could just talk a little bit about that in terms of maybe how your near-term assumptions have changed, if at all. And then as it relates to the second half, it looks like the guidance implies something like $300 million of year-over-year incremental profit improvement in the second half year over year, despite revenue that looks to be flat or down. Can you just offer some color there in terms of one, your confidence in delivering that, and then maybe what the drivers are? Thanks a lot. Frank Lonegro : Sure, so a lot of the questions last night really asked us, at least implicitly, did we know about these things? And when you're dealing with the 10-year plus condemnation litigation, that\u2019s coming to a conclusion you know about it. When you have a liquidated damages dispute, that\u2019s coming to a conclusion, you will know about it. The exact timing that we know which quarter it was going to follow in and I know that we know whether it was going to be 2017, we thought so. But we want to 100% sure, so all of these or in contemplation. We are probably experiencing a bit more inflation this year than we were originally expecting the tax rate probably little bit higher than we were expecting. Fuel price solution, the first half of the year was probably higher than we were expecting. So, there is a bunch this happening, just like every quarter and every year there is lots of moving parts. So, all of this was in contemplation as we thought about the guidance and one of the reasons why we gave you a range of guidance was because you never know which way the pluses and the minuses are ultimately are going to go. Turing to the second half, I think which you're going to see is an improvement in sequential productivity, when you think about a $90 million in Q2 and you look at the record productivity guidance and you given you again that against the $427 million that we delivered in 2016 when you do the math real quick you realize that we got to be at least as good in the second half, if not better in order to hit that target and obviously we have a lot of confidence and our ability to do that, so you should see sequential ramp and productivity between Q2 and Q3. And again Fredrick and his team are doing everything on the customer side to bring in more prices and to price it appropriately. So our teams are going to run the railroad better and better on a quarter over quarter basis, so looks like about second half. Amit Mehrotra : Right. But just quick follow-up on that. I guess the productivity, the way I think about it, is it shows up on the bottom line when revenue and volumes are a little bit more cooperative. They certainly were in the first half, partly due to easier comps and then some tailwinds on the coal side, too. In the second half, you don't really have those tailwinds. Hopefully you will, but it doesn't seem like you will in the second half. So can those productivity savings actually drop to the bottom line when revenue growth is zero or negative in the second half? Frank Lonegro : Yes. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Okay, I will leave it there. One quick question on the capital structure. You have caveated your comment by saying that you want to keep the balance sheet investment grade. Can you just give us a sense on what actually constitutes investment grade? Is it two times growth or net debt to EBITDA? So if we could get a sense of maybe the firepower the Company has, I guess, to optimize the balance sheet, which is I assume what you are trying to do for the benefit of shareholders. Thanks. Frank Lonegro : Sure, obviously we go with the same Moody and S&P ratings that you all follow very closely, you know where those ranges are. Really what we did was took a fresh look at the balance sheet, we took a fresh look at leverage in the implicit ratios based on the free cash flow for the year are going forward basis. We got obviously new CEO and Hunter, we constituted board, we got the shareholder vote behind us or lot of things really said, time to take a look at the capital structure and we want to provide the maximum flexibility for the management team and the board to way in on those issues. So we though like it was appropriate during this period of revaluation, I'm sure that we won\u2019t tie to anything specifically. Amit Mehrotra : Given the momentum you have on the profit growth and the cash flow growth, I mean is there any has other agencies told you or given some guidance around what perimeters, maximum perimeters if you're willing to accept in terms still keep it investment grade. Frank Lonegro : They have. Amit Mehrotra : Can you share those with us please? Frank Lonegro : No, you know where the ratios are, you know where the boundary lines are and obviously we're currently rated triple B plus, AA1. You know, what is that one step down looks like, what two steps down look like, all of those are in contemplation, so we report back to you on that one as we make those decisions and it could be as early as the investor conference or certainly as we turn the page into calendar 2018. Operator : Ravi Shankar of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ravi Shankar : If I can just maybe follow up to that last response. And Hunter, not to steal your thunder, but can you just help us frame the topics of discussion in terms of the broad agenda for the investor day? What can we expect to hear? What do you expect to learn or are going to progress through between now and then that you can share with us at the event? Hunter Harrison : What do you want to hear? We'll give you a menu. No, seriously look, we'll spend a lot of time in then. I tell you it\u2019s not going to be a restatement of all the number you heard today. We\u2019re going to peel back the onion a little bit. We\u2019re going to start taking that while our hump yard had worked today like we used 50 years. We\u2019re going to talk you that, that your economy of scale with that. We\u2019re going to talk you about while we\u2019re able to use locomotives more objectively than some others and some of the techniques. And I guess, it\u2019s kind of hopefully a restatement obtain, we have no a little bit of that over doing here. We got a pretty good track record and we\u2019re going to try to reinforce would be. And at the same time have a little fun and enjoy ourselves and that\u2019s the objective. And I\u2019m sure that each time, we\u2019ve done this. I\u2019d say they have been rather successful couple of puts and takes and now were change a little bit, but it\u2019s too late for that. But I think they have been very helpful in new representatives of our shareholders. For example when they ask you, I don\u2019t understand this why, if they closed hump yard in order to buy that's a good deal or what that you had some knowledge and understanding and appreciation for that. And so that\u2019s our intent, but I would certainly say to you that, if you have to request that you like us to consider of addressing, we\u2019d love to hear them. David, I am sure would love to hear it. We\u2019ll try to address those things. Ravi Shankar : But it sounds like a great event. But would you have made enough progress by then to give us like longer-term OR targets and balance sheet targets? Hunter Harrison : Yes. Certainly, the trends will be there. You can see what we're doing. I don\u2019t know, you won\u2019t have wait and say, we're going to have a validation meeting, but you think it is. When you all are going to satisfy that everything is validate, it would be hard as bleach. Ravi Shankar : Understood. Just as a follow-up, just an end-market question on autos. You guys clearly identified that as a market with a negative near-term outlook for obvious reasons. Can you just help us understand kind of the puts and takes behind decremental margins? And what you can do on the order side if SAR were to decline sharply from here? Fredrik Eliasson : I think historically we\u2019ve been moving very much in line with the automotive production as done and obviously it\u2019s been a great seven or eight years here, we\u2019re righting enough and here we\u2019ve seen a little bit of softening as expected. And then we will monitor that very closely as going forward. We do have the opportunity as this part of our scheduled merchandise network to monitor that and make appropriate changes to plan and see certain areas where tailings gets impacted. So, like any other part of our business, Cindy and team, and Hunter has an operating plan that is flexible enough to be able to address that\u2019s make sure, we don\u2019t lose any of the productivity gains that we have gotten so far and that we\u2019re contemplating the future. Operator : Next we have a question from Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Thank you, sir. Ken Hoexter : Hunter, I just want to clarify or may be just Frank, just including the two gains. Should we reassess reducing the second half targets? Or Frank, were you suggesting before that, that this was in your kind of originally thoughts and the implied savings in the second half should continue to scale? Frank Lonegro : Yes and yes. Ken Hoexter : Okay. So, yes, no I got that. So when you say yes to that first one, you are reducing second half or you are not reducing second half? Frank Lonegro : No, I mean what we were thinking at the beginning of the year, yes, was to change our internal view of the second half, no, while we continue to see productivity accelerate and gains et cetera continue in second half, yes. Ken Hoexter : Okay. Hunter Harrison : You can appreciate where we are. I mean I didn\u2019t know about them. So, if you don't know them, you can't figure them in. But this is what I saw this is what gets us into that leap of faith there, okay. And look, I appreciate that Frank and others in this organization, there needs to be some checking balances. I just don\u2019t mean by checking need, but there are some issues internally of saying and we get there. And we make it and there is a tendency, and you all have accused us of this before and I don't think that we were guilty of being conservative or sandbagging or whatever. I am telling it that my numbers that you hear me talk, not official guidance, let's put in those terms. We don\u2019t determine whether the quarter is clean or not, clearly speaking, there is principles, there is GAAP, there is rules and regs that says, you get to check, you got report to check. Now, it's not like we got draw again -- I used to accuse the CFOs of having a left-hand bottom drawer and they get down there anytime they needed and they could come up with miracle. You learned that but it's not like that. But I think that what I said to you to more of the questions, it\u2019s more of the operating metrics. I am not a big, well, it\u2019s easy comp, what the hell with the comp, the comp has gone it's none. We got a number that says we have to be it that gross tons, miles available horsepower, no matter what it was last year. If it was over the last year we look better but our standards says our be 100% better I am not being influenced, I am not going to be influenced but easy comps, be influenced that\u2019s something else but I think there\u2019s a little bit of just planned if known here and look if we keep precise and hit this thing right on the return, thumbs are on. Ken Hoexter : Appreciate that. If I talk a follow up on the maybe the competitive environment a little bit. You talked your thoughts on where things, but any competitive response from your peers in response to your cost cutting or may be strength in the truck market, are you seeing any strengthening in the pricing on the intermodal, if you can talk about the competitive market response? Hunter Harrison : Let me comment and then I'll turn on Fredrik to be the expert here. My statement is a little -- I've been all over this continent and I go here and I get here and I say what's the competition doing having the kamikaze pricing, they're killing the market, they're putting us under, and I leave and I go over there and they said what are those guys doing you left, ah kamikaze pricing so given this way I don\u2019t know so I don't know where we are there. I do know that you know back to my point about competition. Look, then I go lay down to those where I can laid into this. We're going to be as aggressive as we can be and I say that as we can be because we're going to be disciplined. Cause we're going to you know, a lot of companies can get it to the top-line. That's not the hard part. The hard part is getting into the top-line and there'll be something there we can get to the bottom. So we're trying to you know fulfill both of those and Frederick is much more qualified than I to talk specifically about those markets and competition, so Frederick why don't you. Frederick Eliasson : Sure, so I mean all our customers had options so ultimately it goes back to the fundamental thing that we're trying to do, system scheduled railroading which is to make sure we improve our transit time and improve our reliability, and we are in early stages of that specifically right now to competition I think the key thing it's been a tough transportation environment for several quarters now in terms of pricing to their market and generally this is about truck competition, there is a lot of excess truck competition. Fortunately though as we look at the market over the last few months and we've seen some signs of tightening capacity. I think the combination of tightening capacity environment does move into the second part of this year and early 2018 coupled with what we are expected to do from a service perspective should lead to a 2018 that is good from a top-line perspective and as I said ultimately this is all about providing a service to our customers that they want to use day-in and day-out. Because if we do that I think it's less relevant what our competition either on the rail side or the truck side is doing. Operator : Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning everyone and thanks for getting my question on. Hunter you know earlier in the call you talked about challenges inside the organization to change and how you know you have seen that at your prior leadership position. Can you talk about how that progresses and how you brought your team together and you know how that plays out from a financial perspective as we go through over the next year or two. Hunter Harrison : Well, one of the things we did as a group is convince me and they did not me that we got to do some hard camp. People really got to understand what we're trying to do and do it awful fast and that's very important component here. To be very-very frank with you, we have just had said people you have to change, you got to get things that maybe you didn\u2019t expect on doing in the past, but you got to get with it and if you can't get with it then we got to do something different and we'll try to treat you in the most humane manner possible, but look we got a responsibility to the shareholders and our customers and our other employees with this, we can't carry this way. If I have got to do their job, if I've got to do their part and that's a tough assignment for a leader to do and what we are talking to talk about leadership. One of the things I talked about as the hardest part for a great leader to do and where they fail and what makes the real difference is the ability to make a tough decision. Nobody likes to call in [indiscernible] and say that you can\u2019t use it anymore. I know anybody that plays around that and enjoys it. It\u2019s hard, it\u2019s difficult somebody has got to do it. So we have been very honest and straightforward with the people about what the expectations are. We try to display and add the appropriate amount of patience with people knowing that look I\u2019m not saying which strategy this company has had over the years was right along. You know except a lot of different mergers, people have been exposed to a lot of operating philosophies and it\u2019s just confusing to them. So you know yes its flexible. You know I learn that early on in my career, get a new team and new leader and he comes in and we are going to play this game different and blow up a little bit and then put to you and you can make than change, you get to stay and be a player [indiscernible] and so you make a change. So I think we try to be honest with people and I think they know what is expected of them. But they also know with understanding that its difficult and that\u2019s what I think is the difference in organization. Look, you know if you look at the real business, we all get the same locomotives and same gauge and same signal [indiscernible] all the things in similar markets. Nobody gets some huge handle in the market. What is different about the organization is people and leadership, and how they respond and how lead people and you know that\u2019s why in spite of the fact that we have been criticized, maybe I shouldn\u2019t say we have been, I had been criticized for creating cultures of fear or whatever. And that\u2019s not what we are trying to do, that\u2019s not part of the mission and in spite of this people are saying why are you approaching all my people. And I\u2019m saying a lot of the more come over here, if we get this culture fear and we are so demanding and unreasonable why would they ever want will leave that lovely level of yours and come to mine, maybe you have to look at your whole part. I\u2019m not into the specific about anybody, I\u2019m just saying that we have no one to my knowledge working at CSX that can\u2019t get released. If there are some, they\u2019ve got some hands cuffs on, I don\u2019t know that, I got the key to the hand cuffs. So if they don\u2019t want to work here, I don\u2019t need them. If they want to go to someplace else, that\u2019s where they are able to go. It\u2019s kind of a free market, [indiscernible] is about except when you get into the non-compete and have expert there if you need any advice, so that\u2019s kind of where we are there. Brandon Oglenski : I appreciate that insight Hunter and if I can respectfully ask the question on top-line, because like it or not, there is a perception among investors and maybe some of your prior colleagues that you worked with that, your focus is not really on the customer and you have mentioned it a couple of times today, the post Hunter era you hope CSX grows a little bit more. But I\u2019m trying to line that up with Fredrik\u2019s comments about next year and you guys, I think did win some contracts this quarter. How do we think about the focus on top-line, is that part of the plan over the next couple of years Hunter or should we just be thinking we got to get service and cost in the right place, then we can grow beyond? Hunter Harrison : So, I think, Fredrik, [Indiscernible] to join in the different here. Look, to be successful we have got to hit top-line growth to get you always recall. When people can make mark with us in the late 90s and why was our operating ratio was to be here in Eastern Canada. So well when they saw that we were price increase, they should keep both operating wise and it suppose to be [Indiscernible]. So I learned early on, that this a balancing act between cost and service. I have got in all respect in one of the places that\u2019s still on I think, that goes back to days when I was first being taught about controlling calls and it was amount of sales that shows one side service, once side cost. You got to keep that in balance, if you spend too much and providing this premium service it\u2019s a market they don\u2019t want to everyone pay for, you won\u2019t make any money and vice versa. So to be honest with you, I get a little sensitive about my remarks. Going back to the track record, I went to being - there they didn\u2019t have a great representation about service and they didn\u2019t have to pay their bills, but they have good reputation about service. Look at what had the top-line grew, I guess in spite all of their actions with customers through top-line pretty good. I don\u2019t think is anywhere we have been that we get to see top-line growth and I look at some of the places that I have come to and I aint seen anybody that\u2019s had any crazy outperformance of top-line growth. I just think that\u2019s something that you know if at all they don\u2019t like you, they don\u2019t listen anything, [indiscernible] well, they are not sensitive to customer and I was talking to [Indiscernible] and I think this is right, I have never had anybody say, who it was, when it was, where it was, it\u2019s just the perception you still like customers. I don\u2019t buy into that so I don\u2019t think any of that when in spite of the fact they might not like me. Even in spite of that when this company puts best service out there at the right cost structure we will get the business, this is not like the old days and you can argue that\u2019s just relationship spending - days that where the relationship is that all made dollar for you. So Fredrick. Frederick Eliasson : I'll just add I think ultimately there is actually nothing in consistent with precision scheduled railroading and being customer focus is what is challenging in short-term is just a change and that\u2019s what our team is out there selling right now. Because there is a lot of change so this un linear in terms of the improvements that we have seen. If all be although we still have seen improvement in terms of transit by first quarter to second quarter. And ultimately as we go through change, we feel confident and we have seen some early signs of it that we will have a superior service product to sell thought we have before that\u2019s why I don\u2019t see - and I talked about our customers over the last six months or so that have had precision scheduled railroading experience. And ultimately the feedback is almost consistent from all of them, which is that once you get through the period of change we get to better service products. Then I think while Cindy and I are very much focused and aligned around that as where our team is out there selling to our customers as well. Cindy Sanborn : Yes, I would echo that more of a core tenants of our model here is do what you say you are going to do. And that is 100% focused on the customer. I think Fredrik you mentioned we are going through some transition here that is problematic, but looking at the model how it works I'm extremely confident that this model will work well, it will work well for this company and it will drive not just cost production it will drive superior customers as well. Operator : Our next question will come from Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. Wanted to dig into one of the changes to the train plan has been mentioned which is incorporating committee unit train business into the car loads network, can you give us an examples of what commodities that\u2019s been appropriate for and talk about how that influence same link service and balance and go forward? Cindy Sanborn : So let me go back a little bit to drive some context. So you recall variable train scheduling, merchandise business that was really just our scheduled network and we drove train links as a result of that. And as Hunter came along and we talked about precision scheduled railroading and we look that opportunities where we had overlap on the same sub division where we had a rock train, maybe a metals train, occupying that same territory and generally speaking the quarry or loading facility did not load a full train and very few number of hours they were loading a portion of the train in a different line. And so as we looked at the opportunity to incorporate that in the merchandise network then that allowed us to go to seven day train operation, incorporate those commodities into that merchandise train and drive train links that way with very consistent service and then as you mentioned and talk of that then alone as another layer onto the concept of how do we make sure we have the same number of trains going east and west or north and south depending on where we are to allow even more efficiencies in terms of locomotives and full utilization of our people. So that\u2019s an example of where and types of commodities that has worked for us, and we see pretty good progress with that. And I think its driving some good efficiency and Fredrik can comment on the impact. Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, and I think there are certain where we have been very successful in that and has improved the cycle time for the customers and there are some places where we have yet to improve the cycle time. And we are still working through the customer to make sure we get the operating model I call fine tuning operating model to make sure that we provide a level of service that is needed and there are certain places where we are not there yet but we're relentless of trying to get there. Cherilyn Radbourne : Great that\u2019s helpful color. Wanted to ask a quick one on coal RPU which was relatively stable versus the first quarter, notwithstanding some likely sequential moderation in the export coal rate. Can you just dig into some other moving parts on coal RPU for us? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, I think in the first quarter we mentioned, we had a plethora of things that was all moving in the right direction especially on the mixed side within both domestic side and the export side that all create a positive mix. As we think about the coal part for you components here in the second quarter, export prices is the biggest driver there albeit probably not to the same degree we saw in the first quarter and we don\u2019t have as much mix improvements as we saw and that\u2019s just luck of a draw so to speak, in each and every quarter its different depending on who, which utility wants more coal and where do we go in terms of different export terminals. So really the key driver for coal RPU this quarter was clearly the export pricing. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thank you. That\u2019s all for me. Operator : Thank you. Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Group : Thanks good morning guys, just a few quick ones. Frank can you just clarify, do you have any liquidated damages in the guidance for the back half for the year or anything else unusual. Frank Lonegro : No. If one comes up we will certainly lets you know but no. Scott Group : Okay I would say always helpful to let us know in advance that would be great. Fredrik just on that coal yield, do you have any view on how much of the sequential drop we should expect in the third quarter and then just on the merchandize intermodal pricing number. Do you think that continues decelerate the back half for the year before, I guess you say we accelerate in 2018. Fredrik Eliasson : When I look at my general counsels here, I'm going to make sure that I state that we never forecast price, but more important though, if you go to the coal side clearly it is a commodity market that is very volatile and we have made a decision strategically to align ourselves with the producers to go up and down with that curve, partly because what a level road and rail road's is much as possible. Benchmarks have gone way in the export market but instead lot of index is set out there, that there are customers are we're using to determine, what sort of price we should use and I think you can follow those quite they are well top at size, so there is an opportunity to see what they will do and they will be based on what we're seeing right now obviously some impact. On the merchandize and intermodal network as I said before, it has to be in the tough market for numerous quarter for year and half, two years now in terms of pricing and as that said, as I see the truck market tightening up which there are clear signs that it is and we go through this change period and really start improving the service product the way we expect, I think as you get through 2018 you have an opportunity on both merchandize and intermodal to turn this got a sequential decline around. Scott Group : Okay that\u2019s helpful and then lastly for Hunter, I know you have got the Analyst Day coming up some, I don\u2019t know if you want to get too specific, but it felt like last quarter, on last quarter\u2019s call you sort of blast a low 60's operating ratio next year and 50's may be even mid 50's longer term. Anything three months later change in your mind on that directionally those kind of numbers. Hunter Harrison : No, I felt very confident in, and I'm a four months out here so, but I feel even more confident than I did then, given that I've seen these additional four months of potential [indiscernible]. I think the numbers is just doing solid. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Jeff Kauffman of Aegis Capital, your line is open sir. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much. Just one brief question, Hunter as you have gotten deeper into the details, what have you found that you have been able to make greater traction on maybe then you would had anticipated coming in, and what have you found is going to be a bit of a longer haul or more complex process in terms of getting done the things you are looking to do? Hunter Harrison : Well, clearly Jeff, I think nothing pretty obviously, but clearly this cultural change you call it what you want of the kind of a shift in strategy and at the same time I will go with the just turn my best on the obvious. There are some people that they are more pleased with this change, they more pleased with what we went through with the proxy fight, I tried to please with people during that time, that it's hard to fight one day or one week and then we also wanted one for all the next week. So, we determine here with the best chemistry is [indiscernible] we are all in this together type thing. So, we've got some open wounds there, so that's a key because if we don't have the right leadership, driven the right way we are not going to get these things done, and the first part of the question was more of the opportunities that are even more than I thought initially well, obviously I didn\u2019t think or obviously I didn't, there was more opportunities with the up yards and I felt - I just had this general feeling about railroads that I've been associated with a lot of them in North America that had too many hubs. So I think that that's the opportunity although it's not real easy to get to, was more than I had thought, we have an opportunity and I hadn\u2019t had a chance to spend a lot of time on this personally, but we need to improve our engineering productivity particularly on the capital side which impacts the capital spending more which people don't recognize, but I would rather put another tie and then I would have inefficiencies and not productivity in labor. And I guess the other one that was not on my list at all, because I just was not familiar with the collective bargaining issues and so forth was to go in from the land dispatching officers to one central location. And I think to be confounded on just a minute, but I think the plan is to have that number first quarter of 2018. Cindy Sanborn : That's correct. Hunter Harrison : Which is that's all grade B from most and so I guess just some observations there Jeff. Jeff Kauffman : All right. Cindy, Hunter thank you and we will see in October. Hunter Harrison : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from David Vernon of Bernstein. Your line is open. David Vernon : Hi. Good morning. And thanks for taking the time. Fredrik, are there any metrics on sort of customer satisfaction around service availability that you can share the couple of dimension is. And are there any segment in particular of it standout as is either being more or less happy with some of the changes that are happening at the customer touch points that are enabling some of these changes in this schedule? Fredrik Eliasson : I mean I think we try to work through all parts of our network here in a very rapid pace in terms of making sure that we provide the service we want, with the cost structure that we want long-term. So, as we are encountering challenges from one customer group or one specific customer, we are trying to be as responsive as it possibly as can, as quickly as we can with Cindy. We use JD Power to look at customer service and customer responsiveness and we continue to monitor that. We normally don\u2019t talk too much about that externally, but that is a gauge for us, just. But ultimately this comes down to reliability in transit time. And that\u2019s what we are trying to go through right now. And there will be pain points, we know that and we have communicated that to our customer, but the key thing is the responsiveness from Cindy and team that try to address whatever challenges that we see as quickly as it possibly can. David Vernon : And can you help us dimensioned some of the changes in these metrics. Obviously I know you are not going to share your internal customer satisfaction scores. But I\u2019m just kind of struggling to trying to dimension how unhappy or unhappy this could be and where the source of revenue risk could be within the top-line? Fredrik Eliasson : No, the specific competitive information we try to stay away from talking about that, but clearly what is the strange thing somebody service from unit train to schedule merchandize or when you go out and you change the network as significant as we changed in a very short period of time whether it\u2019s intermodal or merchandizes customers, there is going to be pain points. And the key thing is that we are asking our customers to hang with us, and see what is ultimately on the rise and we look at the new schedules that should allow for better transit time, better reliability, but in the short-term we are out there on a daily basis out to our customers and kind of working through those changes and make sure they see where the light is at the end of the tunnel. David Vernon : All right. I guess thanks for that. And Hunter, one of the broader questions we get asked a lot is, is what is the company being to do to make this precision railroading less just of Hunter Harrison competency and more of a CSX competency. If you think about the next sort of couple of years on the contract that you have with the company and which are going to be doing. What are the two or three tangible things that you think you need to do make sure this precision were already model becomes a CSX competency and is not as tied to you as it seems to be at the early going? Hunter Harrison : Well, let me make this observation first, I mean this is not the first place that schedule precision railroads have been prior to exercise. It has a pretty good, not me it schedule precision railroading has a pretty good track record and its left pretty path. If you look at Illinois Central prior to bankruptcy doing whatever now that was a just a little small regional that ran down here with coals of so we don\u2019t count that. And when you go to Canada the product does not need also went along with and it had a big positive influence on Canadian National and I would say this, it's still hanging out, because I think to the best of my knowledge, [indiscernible] certainly from an operating side, they were looked by a lot of people, rightfully so it was may be still the top railroad out there [indiscernible] and I think they continue to go pretty well from what I read. So this is not the first place that is being tried. Now I think, what I would say to you is the key is this, is how well we teach if you will here and so the better job we do of teaching, coaching, measuring, development let the people understand it and understand really the whys and ins and out. Which you know a lot of people just don\u2019t - and I don\u2019t mean this disrespectfully, just don\u2019t have an appreciation for it. I mean you know some of you have probably heard your whole carrier about unit train efficiencies and I can tell you that unit train efficiency was a biggest factor to ever just remember. It's not unit trains are on average way more costly, okay. You were unbalanced in a lane which is what you want to do, because if you don\u2019t have balanced, you don\u2019t know when that imbalance is coming and there is lost cost associated with it. And you are balanced and here comes the grain, a grain train. So you have to dig and you don\u2019t have a source to supply there to get the load to train. You get the loaded the train after you deadhead it and you run the train to the port. Well they dumped it but it takes three or four days and so there is no empties to move back, So you deadhead the crew back because there nothing form them to do. Well three or four days later now the train is empty and it\u2019s time to run it back, so you run four train instead of two and everybody says what a beautiful operation. And we don\u2019t do it like that and I think to may be to Cheril\u2019s question earlier about this change is with the rock train and the merchandize doubled. We have grain trains that we were running with 56 cars, unit grain train. Other railroads are running 130, we were running some in a 115, can you imagine that the incremental cost is different is basically few. If you are investing money at 56 cars in a unit and you double it to 112 which is big, then you will really make a lot of money. So there are real questions raised there. So I think that I made it and I sit down with people and start to go through this thing like that and they kind of look at me like god [indiscernible], well why are we running unit train. Well that\u2019s because somebody one day taught some statistics that\u2019s the way you do it. And so everybody evolved into their systems. So the more time and we are going to get a good feel for this next week for the first 10 because the people they are going this time are little different than what we have done before. He is going to be operating people and is going to be basically transportation operating people which is where we need the help the quickest. So it\u2019s going to get specialized force with handpicked individuals from the existing team because people said to me here, we don\u2019t have people that are able to and I don\u2019t believe that. Where we have just moved is got a lot of smart people that want to make itself from the part to do well is just our job to find them. So I think that will be the key is to have what we do in this development at every level. And that we are consistent from a price running to the price yard. We used to talked about it in early my career, we come in for staff meeting and then talked about three things, cost, service and they just need service to get all of this. And we believe you go home and every morning they talk to is about cost. The only time they talked about service and safety is when we came back from another quarterly meeting. They talk about the best service cost and safety. What you think will react to it, cost so that\u2019s what we heard. So those people re understanding what you want will give it you, you can say it but if they don\u2019t know and you just say you know not down in target want and they don\u2019t know why or whatever. If that\u2019s not the right strategy they don\u2019t know the alternatives or what to do. So the better I do , we do collectively as a group developing these people most successful it\u2019s going to be get ahead of some of the competition. Now whether that\u2019s [indiscernible] but competition. Operator : Mr. Vernon was that all? David Vernon : That\u2019s it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is John Larkin of Stifel. John Larkin : Hey good morning and thank you for taking my question. We haven\u2019t talked a lot about intermodal today but I thought it was a good topic to bring up especially given that CSX historically has had a relatively unique intermodal strategy with what I call the regional sortation centers like the one in North West Ohio, the one that maybe planned in North Carolina perhaps is the third one in the long-term plan for somewhere in the Alabama area. Allows you to serve much larger number of origin destination pairs but does take a little away from the truck load like service potential. Just wondering how that plan looks relative to the overall precision rail roading emphasis and whether that will survive as envisioned or whether you planned to adjust that to make it more compatible with the overall precision rail roading operating strategy? Hunter Harrison : So, Fred and I will both comment. John, whatever works - the challenge that we have with intermodal is price, there is no doubt about it. But at the same time, I would say to you that we are pretty this company I am new to is pretty disciplined in their approach, cost control. So I don\u2019t think right now all intermodal practice. And if you believe any of our numbers of what we had improved on so we are going to see our margins improve the number 8%, 10%, well that really gives us the opportunity to be even more aggressive and going after growth. That\u2019s where I think John some people miss it, the cost control or controlling expenses, so paramount in this effort to grow the business. We have - my last episode like this with the - CSX, last time I did this, the group invited me in a week before I got there, and took our largest customer and signed a 10 year deal. And then said, they know what you make money out of this business. That\u2019s tough, so and they were down about 267 on margin length, which meant there was no free cash flow. But I\u2019m proud to report to you that 18 months later, they were in the top five, they were in the top five, because the team had been able to take the number which was 29 down to 17 and hold 10% more total and now what was the [Indiscernible] no price difference to the customer just internal controls made us be able to play that market. So I think to some degree that will offer some opportunities for us to continue and I\u2019m not sure I don\u2019t stand totally the recent strategy, but that strategy and others that Fredrik and his team might want to pursue. Fredrik Eliasson : Yes and I think the key thing is and you have heard Hunter talk about the opportunity because it did grow the business, because that\u2019s ultimate opened up what we need to do. Traditionally intermodal has been a key growth market for us, we have been able to grow this base domestic at 5% to 10%, then we don\u2019t see any reason why that should change, but it\u2019s always about converting traffic of the highway system and what Hunter is focus on in addition to intermodal is also to convert things the highway into our merchandise network by significantly improving that service product. The key thing for us in intermodal has been and it could be to make sure that we drive productivity and we have always been focused on that terminal, train lengths, making sure we are pricing it appropriately and clearly with a new balance train plan we have taking train length in even greater level and that\u2019s going to be helpful. In the short haul kind of area that we are in, being able to connect the dots in the way that we can do with - how has really allowed us to grow that part of our network in a way that we haven\u2019t been to do historically. So I think being able to connect the dots efficient like we have is critical. So every piece of business has to carry its own length and when we look at [Indiscernible] what we do there, it is carrying its own life and has been great success and we've post our seven times and I think that's the business model that we think will continue and make sense. John Larkin : Thank you, maybe just a quick question on the international side of intermodal now that the third set of locks has been opened for quite some time in Panama, have you noticed any increased volumes on East Coast ports and now with the Bay on bridge completed do you see that as an opportunity for metal business. Fredrik Eliasson : If you go back to 2010 70% of our international and modal business came through the East Coast today it\u2019s 80% and it is slightly higher than that so we've seen this go on for the better part of a decade in terms of the more and more of our traffic coming into the East Coast ports and if you just look at the growth numbers by the East Coast port versus the West Coast ports you see that that trend generally seems to be continuing. So the good news is that we have the infrastructure in place to be able to solve that and I know that very hard on the sort of thing that you said that New York is doing, Savannah is expanding their capabilities, Charleston is expanding their capabilities, Norfolk as always been in the forefront of that as well so all of the ports and [indiscernible] all of the ports are preparing for additional growth and we are well positioned to capture that as we see additional cargo coming into the East Coast ports. John Larkin : That's terrific, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you, next we have a question from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : Yes, thanks for fitting me in here. So Frank you gave us considerable detail on the restructuring charges that you broker out of the labor expense line and the quarter, but there is any way, is there a way you can help us quantify some of the other costs you incurred during the quarter you know related to the closing of hump yards and other changes to the operating plan, your net-net just trying to get at what a reasonable run rate expectation could be for the non labor variable expense lines like MSNO and rates look like as we head into the second half of the year. Frank Lonegro : Okay, in terms of the restructuring charge Bascome the only thing that we're putting in there are things associated with the management restructuring that we did as well as some of the dialogue that we were having between Maple Ridge as an act to the shareholder and the company and so those are the things that we're putting in there in terms of the restructuring charges going forward you should see the very minimal restructuring charges in Q3 and Q4. Now to your point about run rate expenses if you want to just take it down to labor and fringe side obviously you saw significant efficiencies there offset by inflation, incentive comp and things of that nature, if you were thinking about looking forward on labor and fringe year-over-year should be favorable on labor and fringe for both Q3 and Q4. If you want to talk about MSNO obviously we were down 29 million year over year and down 77 million sequentially or 22 million if you want to back up a combination gain. So if you look at Q2 versus Q3 sequentially, ex-condemnation you should see MSNO lower, and then just as you know Q4 had the real estate gain in Q4 of last year so you got to pull that one out as you think about run rates for MSNO. You know fuel when we jump to fuel real quick if you think about where we were in fuel, price is the big driver of the year over year change in expense in Q2, I think you should probably think about Q3 as a set of brackets depending where price ends up going. It's probably on the expense side, up year over year due to price but likely down sequentially because of the continued improvement on the efficiency side so that will give you a range there. On the rents that line move a heck of a lot. You saw the re-class that we called out in that particular line. And so I don\u2019t think, we are going to see a lot of move that\u2019s because car hard to calm down is part of line as you take the lower to second times improve in the second half of the year. Bascome Majors : I appreciate all the detail there. Just one follow-up for Cindy or Hunter here. Just you mentioned some of the talent capture, you are having some success feeling on the operating team. Where those left and when do you expect to field them and just curious where you are finding these people that you are seeing pretty excited about to adverse the FX team? Thanks. Cindy Sanborn : Well, I think as we change operating model and culture to goes with that the Hunter is pulled upon. I think it is a big part, maybe the biggest part of implementing, we are working on implementing. So we have pretty gone external in terms of attracting people through our normal channels to attract people and some other railroads excited about the opportunity here. I think we have a huge opportunity here and I think the folks that are coming in there as well. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : We will move on to Jason Seidl of Cowen. Hunter Harrison : Good morning Jason. Operator : Jason Seidl, did you have a question? Jason Seidl : Yes, guys. Sorry, I was on mute. Fredrik, first question for you. Given that we have seen some strength in the truckload marketplace and the looming ELD mandate. Customers on the intermodal and maybe some of the competitive merchandise lanes come to you guys and talked about capacity on the railroad for next year? Fredrik Eliasson : Well, I think those, so sort of compensations that we are in the early stages of having and pretty recent that we seen the stock market move up in a sustain passion, we have some good starts in the past, but the stock market is moving up. So as people are trying to get into planning for [indiscernible] needs for 2018, I expect those dialogues to occur much more frequently. And that\u2019s where some of our encouragement is coming from. Jason Seidl : Okay. Fair enough. And I guess the last one is for Hunter. Hunter, you talk a little bit about how there is changes obviously, when you come to this organization and some people are happy about and some people might not be. Could you talk a little bit about the changes and how you are handling and even for the people that are happy that are there and does the dynamic change much between operations and sales and any communication in gaps, but there may be and should we see, I guess of a ramp up of things just running smoothly as we run throughout the year? Hunter Harrison : Well, I don\u2019t want to pacific, all the, so I\u2019m looking problems. But clearly, we are trying to take a team approach for this. We are into kind of three free lane [indiscernible] where we don\u2019t really have that place we kind of [indiscernible]. I think that there is a lot to be determined yet on how the organization will eventually end up. And I\u2019m not sure what things going to be and that plan is going to be [indiscernible] and others will have a big part to play, where we end up there. I think the, some of that's creating some anxiety with people, that we've tried to say that's not an issue, that's not something that you should necessarily worry about. we're trying to do you know Fredrick and I've tried this before, and then real success we are making it work that I think they are talking about maybe given some commission sales in certain areas, I would certainly encourage that, that we do some things differently that we throw some letter in the wall differently, I think Cindy has given her comments, clearly I think she's got certainly grasp on where we're strong and where we're a little weak, where we need help and the varied way to deal with. We've created different places, although I'm not a big advocate of consultants, we have two or three people that I've worked with over the years, that are in retired capacity, that are out doing some basic work today where we have some very hard working confident managers but we can [indiscernible] them up a little more by giving them some help. So, I think all of those things are very important to us, going forward - you have been building a room of team players and it does take you long when walk in that room you get a sense of the forming of the [indiscernible] happy no matter what their mass is. I mean we have get to people that have got prettier smiles, but if you pull them back they've got the ugliest smile and we got to be able to read some of that. So I mean just trying to put that chemistry that is [indiscernible] pull together, it's tough enough, pulling together, when you pull in part, it really makes you difficult and hopefully I can be as I told you my first time on the [indiscernible] I am a short timer here, I am an interim person that's been trying to get this company the next step, that foundation, I'm a active shareholder, I'm want to see this organization do well and I don't want to be used getting in people\u2019s way and careers and that's not my role, that's not my purpose. I had a very some very best named dialogues, some of the Board members about but I felt like I had to do or didn't do for the organization I think that's clearly spelled out, I think most of the team here knows pretty well where I'm coming form and understand the agenda and so far we've been successful and people had been [indiscernible] and so I feel pretty good about what is taking place here. Jason Seidl : Thank you for the color and thank you for the time. Hunter Harrison : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Next we have a question from [indiscernible] of Morningstar. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah. Thanks. Hunter, some investors have questioned the ability to achieve results on par of the Canadian Rails due to CSX operating in more populated regions and configured in the less linear design. What structural object obviously those have you found that could constrain some aspects of performance maybe velocity, operating ratio or customer service or some other aspects of performance asking about structural obviously? Hunter Harrison : A lot, I don\u2019t know that there are any particular \u2013 there are some but I mean we have to deal with them. I\u2019ll tell you quick story and answers at this way, but I went to Canada and CEN has made some pretty low changes mostly around by scenic or engineering it takes a lot of people out. And one of their statement was public was known ever aspect but Canadian railroad to be contained with U.S. numbers it\u2019s just not structurally in the car, okay. Except when CEN became the load of operating ratio, the U.S. road did that every aspect we are going to improve the U.S. and we expect that to get to see in the imagine standard, it\u2019s just not the car, well I have been on both sides of the board and I vote for CSX headquarters over Calgary was [indiscernible]. Healthcare is an issue that that\u2019s obviously France and healthcare knowledge makes it much better in Canada, but we got some weather in Canada, it doesn\u2019t make it pleasant to be there and some mountain although we get some mountain here to people forget about this mountain to be even Tennessee and so forth. And so, I don\u2019t think that there is any structural issues. I think we got a plane field that we do our job and we have got a plenty of opportunity [indiscernible]. I think something the way that did I, I would say what is going to come up with the like this make some sense and I don\u2019t know what it is. I haven\u2019t heard a good answer yet. First 40 years I didn\u2019t hear that structured, but all was certainly was big impairment structural and then left one away particularly what we found out that the, I don\u2019t see much of all that that except the two can be forces at the same consultant that against the development of this fall that is structural issue. So, let me I think there is a maybe no one placing. Let me ramp something up and okay start there is going to be something a little bit. Let me start, there is been obviously we have talked a lot today and around this issue of playing order and where we are going to be in. So, let me say this to you, this is going to be challenging going forward, because mostly we haven\u2019t talked about that we are in a position that this organization is going to develop the amount of U.S. whole lot of free cash from the real estate market. And not unlike what we experienced at my last employer. For example, I\u2019m not an expert on this but I think I am right about, we set at different locations in Jacksonville. Next year we will be in two, five location, willing to be sold, get out of the lease, whatever the take might be. We are moved or ahead of our training center in Atlanta, also very pretty expensive piece of property there. And all those done, there is a lot of money in there. Now we debated in terms of how much, and I am always precise, internally it\u2019s all to half way, I think be in plus. And my point is this, I can\u2019t tell you how the real estate market is going to move over the next two or three years, I can\u2019t tell you exactly what the interest rates will do, I can\u2019t exactly tell you what the timing of the some of the things are, but when they are concluded, they are concluded. And you can call non-recurring, although they have 24 straight months, all we can do is do our job of running and operating. And then when we do something with real estate our other assets that are made available as a result of these operating changes, so that\u2019s something that we should think about and then you should think about and consider as we go forward. I thought back last night, not the first time I have done this and I have been CEO for 20 years or so, maybe longer, a little break in there but and I said have you ever seen a clean board, I mean clean, clean board, squeaky clean board, no. well how I do describe the clean board. But with these results, I look back to some degree earnings then I looked at trends, productivity improvements, those type things, let\u2019s say what this organization is potentially in the future and size. So sorry for [indiscernible]. Frank Lonegro : Next question please? Operator : Certainly. Thank you. Walter Spracklin of RBC. Your line is open sir. Walter Spracklin : Yes, thanks for squeezing me in there. I guess Hunter when I talk investing opportunity you are proposing I think no one questions really that there will be significant change. I think really the question comes around how fast and how significant. So my two questions are around that. You have kind of addressed both. But we will start with the how fast. When you did what you did at CN it was a little bit over a longer period of time I think you are building a team, you are applying a precision railroad model that, you used once before but over a larger network. When you went to CP it was much faster and I think part was you brought over a team that knew in depth of how precision railroading worked. Are you building, rebuilding a team, I know you said you are pulling people, you are using a few experienced, those experienced in precision rail, but overall is this a longer process because you are kind of rebuilding the team or is this you have done now three or four times and you can hit the ground much quicker than before. Hunter Harrison : Well I mean I think when we hit the ground it all factors in each case it was kind of this. So the team here did a lot about this good bad and different and get to see every day the results of the Friday night side and what they were and what it might be and do a little research and I think maybe somewhat we are saying here this might be a good opportunity that the others were looking at a different way. But that quickly came to a conclusion here that we have at the senior level I don\u2019t think we have here any efficiencies like that and maybe prescribe at this middle managerial level. So as I told you some kind of interim step there and then the board which is part of is now and we file another assistance will likely be the selection for you have got to leave this company on that and that\u2019s important. I think that then I would be able to interrogate I think once they heard a little bit from me and then when we heard, they understood to some degree that it\u2019s a good match and we had some good people at the wrong spots without the appropriate amount of expertise and knowledge and some of that was their fault and some of them not. And so that\u2019s when we kind of where that do this and we brought couple of people in that were actually kind of lock star attach to them. And then we rub each other of bringing I guess the volume in about \u2013 and I think that maybe is all the risk to do even in what we do in the camps and given that they install in the place but if it\u2019s not you know what to do then. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be, where you have got \u2013 this is top most and we have got some restrictions from the last employer to the retirement party that gave me but it seems to have until I could retire anybody from there. Well that\u2019s another story, and then so there is all kind of restriction out there about who get higher who and so forth and I\u2019ll be proud to say that we don\u2019t have anybody. One of the things that Cindy encouraged and we have done is that we really to a large standpoint were behind and perhaps with this. I don\u2019t believe the Indians are like more into [indiscernible] and that\u2019s what we had and we had well and have good conductors and engineers that didn\u2019t want to take this job, they like to cut it. So that\u2019s wrong, that\u2019s people that don\u2019t know how to value car mover on new railroad. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going forward will be a continuation. I just think the issue is kind of to your question [indiscernible] now if we go through - what I have never been through a time where this country is like its politically ever, I never dreamed of the time like this. So I don\u2019t know what is going to happen in Washington and I don\u2019t think they got the view. So we follow one time where we think about turn for no other reason, freight and made in America, a lot of things, infrastructure, well I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going then. But if we had if there is such thing in normal without any geopolitical interruptions I think it\u2019s very reasonable to say that we can get this done in the timeframe we talked about which is I guess 2020 we will have it done by then, I think it\u2019s very reasonable. But if we miss three, four months or you are going to choose, or the shareholders not going to love us, that has pretty good run anyway. So I think we are going to get there, I admit one yet [indiscernible]. Walter Spracklin : So on the second question on the impact again I don\u2019t think many doubt your ability to drive you alone down of the range. You mentioned is what revenue showing through that. Those views out there they were, call that perhaps will be some service disruptions. My question to you is and when we look at the data we do see a contraction in, we see your volume level tracking below peers that could be kind of reasons for that, now touch on that but we are also seeing pricing come down on the rate of growth, my question are you right now seeing volume share losses on account of those disruptions or are you having the price lower to keep that volume because of the perceived volume disruptions, service disruptions, I guess your view as to when that will smoothen out if it is happening? Hunter Harrison : Walter this service disruption, there has been adjustment which we have many, I have got the numbers, 400, 500 customers do 90% business, a lot of customers. We have had two that might make the case, major disruption. And one case the major disruption was back to where they were then you have heard and it was a result of some labor actions pushed back some way and we had to take a few names and pass another pressure. So that is really not in my view effected any top-line. I don\u2019t know that there has been anything pricing wise that\u2019s affected the bottom that we have made any desperate moves in. We have got a couple of, you all know this is no secret I\u2019m not a big not right to advocate, I think it\u2019s not in anybody\u2019s interest but others see it differently. You go out two, three five years and so forth. But we got a couple of big ones over the next 18 months that are coming up. And you know look part of the alignment you get here is when you walk in and let\u2019s say the new one is off the block. If you don\u2019t do me a cut, if you don\u2019t do this for me I\u2019m going to say you are not sensitive to the customer and I\u2019ll get you to use this and when I get criticized about this I don\u2019t, I\u2019m not worried about it, somebody said you don\u2019t want to \u2013 well I did and that\u2019s some business we get apart. I don\u2019t think that and to this earlier what we said to the customer is we are going to say what we say we are going to do. You know you go to one way or around and they say you don\u2019t have any chance. So you get that service, you got another area and put schedules in and now you have not been insensitive to customer. I mean how would you like to go and call somebody to book the flight on the \u2013 and then say what time you want to leave? And then you believe it\u2019s their time to file service for them. Well I don\u2019t think that people united will think that it\u2019s necessary. All that being said, the service and the operating metrics and all those things is only going to improve and then it improve service and add to the lower cost and you have got a double effect here, you got a download there. So I don\u2019t see anyhow and you know what I\u2019d love, I\u2019d love to somebody to serve the public debate, okay to represent the shippers and I will debate in Times Square and about this issue of who, where, when came about. So I\u2019m not, I think that\u2019s all about it. Walter Spracklin : Fair enough, just an housekeeping for Fred and maybe for Frank as well. Frank did you say 39 was the tax rate for the rest of the year or is that the new tax rate going forward?. Frank Lonegro : What I said was 39 to 40 in Q3. I think it would probably be somewhere in the 38to 38.5 in Q4 and then obviously we\u2019ll take a look at next year. Walter Spracklin : Okay. And Freddie did you update on the export coal, I missed it but did you give any update your guidance on the export call I think you were at 30 million tons or high 20s. Fredrik Eliasson : Yes Frank in his prepared remarks, we said about 30 million tons in export pull market for the year with a declining rate structure and those slightly based on what we are seeing in terms of indexes. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Thank you very much for your time. Hunter Harrison : All right, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Yes, we have one more question. Justin Long of Stephens. Justin Long : Good morning. And thanks for setting me in. So Hunter maybe the follow-up on the point you made a little bit earlier on real estate. Are you factoring in those real estate gains when you talk about the potential for a low 60s OR next year and something in the 50s longer term or would the real estate gains be incremental to the objective? Hunter Harrison : It\u2019s incremental. Justin Long : Okay. Great. And then. Hunter Harrison : Anything real estate, we did achieve these numbers. Justin Long : Okay, that\u2019s helpful to clarify. And then secondly I wanted to ask about coal, and how that\u2019s influencing some of the changes you are making in the network today? When you think about your coal business, what is your assumption on how that looks three to four years from now as you start to implement various structural and operational changes in the network as a whole? Hunter Harrison : I will comment. Fredrick has other comments. Look, I\u2019m not going to buy a locomotive for coal, okay, I\u2019m not [indiscernible] as assets 40 years of life and my personal view, I am not an expert on this point, almost got run out of hand that fossil fuels - that\u2019s a long-term view, that will not happen overnight, it\u2019s not going to be two, three years but it\u2019s going away in my view with all those issues, environmental and so forth natural gas always in pressure, coal is not along current issue. And we will see what comes up with this commitment to coal and so forth. And so look having said that the right car load coal that shipped [indiscernible] now I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s 2020, 2030 or when, but we are not going to make long range and if something changes drastically at the end of market we are not going to go out and put going track in or buy locomotives or anything for coal. Fredrik Eliasson : And just to build on what Hunter just said and I think we have been pretty clear that over the long-term we think it will decline, and there will be periods that we are seeing right now where coal will be going up and we are trying to capture that value economically and so with our customers as their needs are increasing or decreasing. But overall it\u2019s a good business for us and to Hunter\u2019s point we want to be there the last [indiscernible]. Justin Long : Okay, makes sense. I know it\u2019s been a long call. We really appreciate the time. Hunter Harrison : Thanks a lot. Thanks everybody for joining us. We appreciate it and I can\u2019t hardly wait unit the third quarter call. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation in the call. You may disconnect your lines.",

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction I'd like to turn the call to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. David Baggs : Thank you, Shirley, and good morning everyone. And on behalf of the management team here at CSX Corporation I'd like to welcome you to our quarterly earnings call, and also thank you for your interest in our company. Our presentation, our quarterly finance reports, and our press release, which conveyed our results and reaffirmed our 2017 guidance, are all available on our Web site at csx.com in the investor section. In addition, a webcast replay of this presentation will be available later today, and the 10-Q will be posted tomorrow on that same Web site. This morning, CSX is being represented by our Chief Executive Officer, Hunter Harrison; our Chief Operating Officer; Cindy Sanborn; our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Fredrik Eliasson; and our Chief Financial Officer, Frank Lonegro. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure. Any statements about the future made during the course of this presentation or during the question-and-answer session should be taken in the full context of this disclosure. Turning to Slide 3, is our non-GAAP disclosure. While CSX files all of our financials in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we're providing certain non-GAAP measures to give you a more wholesome understanding of the business. These measures should be taken in the full context of this disclosure and with the understanding that they are not a substitute for GAAP. Finally, with our investor conference less than two weeks away, and with close to 30 analysts covering CSX, I would encourage everyone today to limit their questions to one. With that, it is my great pleasure and privilege to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Hunter Harrison. Hunter? Hunter Harrison : Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining us. As David said, we've got a lot to discuss today, and my remarks are going to be a little different than they normally might be. I'm going to allow Frank to run do the numbers, there's no use in us both doing it. And to try to give you some explanation or at least our read on the quarter, which some could characterize as mixed results. There were a lot of dynamics going on and taking place in the third quarter, which was a carryover to some degree from the second quarter, and was a challenging start. So, let me start here. I think that we went through obviously some slippage service-wise in the third quarter, which we're not proud of, which we had a listening session last week with the Surface Transportation Board, with their team members. I think some of you were present. I think there was some mixed reporting there, but I can tell you this, I've been in this business a long time, and this company is back to where it was -- it's back to where it was, and it's better, and it's climbing, and I see those issues, generally speaking, behind us, which I'm very proud of that. It reflects to some degree the resiliency of this organization, to go through what this organization has been through, and to be able to come out of an eight-nine-week, a little setback. And I didn't really \u2013 I considered initially as we went into this transaction; I didn't want to spend a lot of time reflecting that. But I do think it will to some degree add some context that this was not a failure of the model, a failure [indiscernible] railroading. Some of the historians aren't very good historians, this is not a new operating plan. This is an operating plan that's been in existence for 20 years plus. It's had a pretty good track record. In fact, I would -- it's a little hard for me to be objective, but an excellent track record. And so I think, as we reflect, it was more of an execution issue. We didn't execute at a lot of levels, and we learned that. And as a result, we had to make some, what I would describe as painful changes, that's never pleasant to do, but we had to do that. We had two derailments that were a real concern to me. One was a pretty horrific derailment on the side of a mountain that you read a lot about, that we have changed some procedures as a result, and I would say also to the local people there that we were dealing with who were extremely, extremely cooperative to our efforts trying to get that derailment under control. And then we had a -- and still I have under investigation a derailment in South Carolina that I'm convinced from a personal standpoint is clearly a case of sabotage where we had a bulldozer flipped on the track covered by [indiscernible]. And we came around, and that's not unusual in that territory to have that. And we hit the bulldozer, derailed the cars. Thankfully nobody was hurt. We've got rewards out. But those things, the derailments, the personnel changes that had to be made, I think to some degree we had reflected and understood that there's resistance to change, and we were going to have to deal with that, and we've had to in a little more difficult way than I thought it might be. But having said that, I think the most significant issue that came out here is we learned a lot about some of our people. We've made some personnel changes and we've developed some real, what I would describe as, rock stars, both in-house, from other rails, from the free market, and [indiscernible] line as well. I am very pleased that I think the organization is ready to go forward at what I might describe as breakneck speed. The operating plan that we had talked about, I think just the last week or the week before, we brought in our first dispatchers from the field, which takes us from -- we will make this first move to take us from nine offices to one here in Jacksonville. It's a big step. I think -- and these things are dynamic, and the markets change, but I think that we have pretty well settled in with the hump yard, I think we started off with 12 or wherever we were in [indiscernible], and we are down now to four, I think, core yards, which are effectively in in Selkirk, New York; and Waycross, Georgia. Also, Indianapolis Avon yard, and I guess Willard is the last one that will probably be closed soon. So that hump yard work is mostly behind us. Dispatcher work is behind us. Personnel moves are in place. The learning curve is going up. And I am as excited as I ever had been or more so about the future of the organization going forward. So I will have some more remarks at the end. At this point, let me catch my breath and let Frank help convert some of these things into our earnings results. Frank Lonegro : Thank you, Hunter, and good morning everyone. I will briefly walk you through the quarter and touch on a few fourth quarter and full-year items. And then, we will take your questions. In the early part of the quarter, as Hunter mentioned, we rolled out significant changes to the network operating plan as a result of our rapid transition to Precision Scheduled Railroading. While our service took a step back in July and August, we are pleased to report that our velocity and dwell performance in September were favorable to Q1 levels. And we expect continued improvement going forward. The changes we made to the operating plan helped drive significant train length improvements on a sequential basis. Balancing the train plan and consolidating train types drives efficiency saving through better asset and resource utilization. Cars and locomotives and service are down significantly year over year. And we are able to run our railroad and our company with fewer resources. Compared to year-end 2016 resource levels, our total workforce is lower by over 4000 FTEs, including over 1,000 contractors and consultants. Turning to slide eight, from a financial perspective, we were encouraged by the results for the third quarter. While we took a direct hit from Irma, experienced a number of significant derailments, and transitioned to a new operating plan, we made good progress toward our 2017 and longer-term goals. Jumping into the details of the income statement, revenue was up 1% year-over-year, driven primarily by core pricing gains of 3.5% all in and 2.2% excluding coal as well as 1% volume growth at higher fuel recoveries, partially offset by unfavorable fix. Total expenses were $2 million favorable with efficiency savings more than offsetting the impacts of inflation and higher fuel prices. Our quarterly financial report goes through the details of each operating expense line item. But I would like to quickly call your attention to a couple of key points. Our labor and fringe expense was down 6% on 10% fuel resources. Our MSNO was slightly unfavorable given the combined impact of several train accidents, relocation costs, and asset impairments which offset the favorable efficiency gains from better asset and resource utilization. And while fuel expense was up, the increase was driven entirely by a 19% increase in the price of diesel. Top line stability plus our relentless focus on controlling costs drove the 4% improvement in operating income, a 4 point of operating ratio improvement and 6% EPS growth, reflecting both higher earnings and the completion of our $1.5 billion share repurchase program. On slide nine, year-to-date free cash flow generation is strong at over $1.5 billion, reflecting solid top line gains, significant efficiency savings, and the reduced capital intensity of our business. Please note that our third quarter cash flow benefited from the deferral of tax payments allowed by the IRS for companies impacted the recent hurricanes. We expect to make the third and fourth quarter tax payments by year-end. Free cash flow growth has enabled increased shareholder return including the $0.2 dividend increase earlier this year plus the completion of our expanded buyback program. CSX's improved financial performance is reflected in our improving ROIC which exceeds 10% on a trailing 12 months basis and a stable debt-to-EBITDA ratio even with higher debt levels. Turning to slide 10, our fourth quarter volume outlook on a comparable [technical difficulty] basis is neutral, with nearly two-thirds of our business expected to be growing or stable year-over-year. The global benchmarks support continued strength in export coal with fourth quarter tonnage expected to be similar to what we saw in Q3. And intermodal is expected to continue to grow reflecting strong consumer sentiment, and a tighter truck market. On the other side of ledger, several markets continue to be impacted by specific headwinds, mostly notably the anticipated decline in North American light vehicle production, the evaporation of unit train shipments of crude oil, and the secular challenges of domestic utility coal. Looking forward, as our service product continues to improve and we transition to a faster, more reliable service solution for our customers we will see growth prospects across a wider spectrum of our markets. Wrapping up, on slide 11, we are on track to deliver on operating ratio around the high end of the mid-60s, with record productivity savings, EPS growth of 20% to 25%, and free cash flow of around $1.5 billion. We completed our buyback program in five short months. We look forward to seeing you at our investor conference in two weeks, and would now be delighted to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good morning. Hunter Harrison : Good morning, Ken. Ken Hoexter : Hunter, maybe you can talk a little bit about your thoughts on kind of share loss and your ability to regain that given some of the service issues. Do you see that you've kind of lost some share, and is it -- would it be permanent and tougher to win back in that case or as you get the service improved do you think that starts to shift back? Hunter Harrison : I think it's just about immediately. Well, that shippers who are out there, they are trying to get the bargain, best bargain they can get. And the safety for that, the competitive service at a competitive price [indiscernible] the business. This is not the old days of some kind of relationship sales. This is about who's got the best product, who's got the lowest price. We think we're going to be there. And so we think this speaks in our market share, and I'm not a big advocate of the market share data and accuracies [ph] that it reflects, but not to dwell on that, I'm convinced of this, all you\u2019ve got to do is get our service where we know it can be, where it is relative [ph] to improved to, and then have a competitive price out there, and you'll have your fair share of the business. Ken Hoexter : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open; you may ask your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hi, good morning everyone, and thanks for letting me ask a question. So Hunter, I mean, we've heard all the anecdotal evidence from the shippers about what went wrong and how service deteriorated on your network. But maybe can you just give us a little bit deeper lessons learned through this process, and why you feel that the organization is now in place to deliver better results coming forward? Hunter Harrison : Yes, I can share this when we get back from the hearing with the Surface Transportation Board. We had three customers that we were having to embargo because they couldn't accept the shipments that were delayed. And now we are accused to be in a violation where we got [indiscernible] 60 cars on hand, and you take five plus weeks to unload them, you know, there\u2019s two sides of the story, [technical difficulty] change and the resistance that people give to you. I have talked about that moving from a proxy side into a change is not the greatest environment, so we had some resistance. And look, I don't want to -- I'm not trying to point a finger to anyone, you know, some of our best railroaders, hardest workers, you know some of our labor union people, the last time I talked about that I was going to finger at them, I am not finger at them. The first tranche of people that left the organization were high percentage of management people. So I'm not pointing the fingers. Collectively, as a team, we didn't get the job done. And as a result of that, we made some personnel changes, we had some -- well, I'll just be frank; we had some embarrassing situations that we had to deal with and we dealt with them. Are they hard to deal with? Yes, they're hard to deal with. We\u2019ve had some \u2013 at one of our major gateways, we had a case where some people falsified records on car movements, so they wouldn't be criticized about cars being delayed. We can\u2019t tolerate this, and so, we've got maybe a little ahead of ourselves on the hump yard closures, , maybe I am pushing too hard. But I think we've learned all the lessons there are to be learned. We've seen what we can do the last 6,8, 10 weeks. I think Cindy and her team have done a stellar job of recovering and putting us back where we need to be, and it's going to get even better. I mean that's the encouraging thing. And so, if you can just get out from under the anecdotal, and if you were there in some of those hearings last week, the hearings weren't about CSX service. In my view, the hearings were about more political issues of reciprocal [ph] switching and open access, and some of those things. Now look, we're ready to participate in that dialog, but let's call a spade a spade. We had -- I participated in that session. I think there were 10 or 11 customers -- specific customers that testified. We had more positive responses from customers that weren't there at home. And some of the surveys that are going on out there, I don\u2019t put a lot of faith in, and if you look at what they're looking at, and then how many people are actually giving honest, frank feedback in discussing -- I guess the bottom line, there's no hurdle out there going forward that we can't get over. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Hunter Harrison : Shirley? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Go ahead with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So just touching on intermodal markets and the strategy, you were seeing some reports on Northwest Ohio's role in intermodal network, maybe some service offerings begin adjusted. So as you move past the initial stage of design with the hump yards and the flat switching. Is it the hub and spoke design for your intermodal something you're also considering to rework? And what does that have -- or what implications are there for Ohio and also the Carolina Connecter that was planned for North Carolina. Thank you. Hunter Harrison : Yes, thanks. Let me just answer that in two words. Number one, we've got an investor conference coming up in two weeks now that we will talk thoroughly about that and other issues. But at the same time, I could answer that -- answered several other questions. Everything we're doing is under review. Now I can't tell you what the outcome is going to be. We don't go in there and look at an issue, and have an answer. We go in to look and to develop and answer. So we'll see what it brings. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. You may ask your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I know you highlighted sort of what the derailments cost you specifically in the quarter. But I was wondering if you could maybe help us understand a little bit sort of how the service ran through the model and sort of what the expenses related specifically to that, and maybe a little bit of weather? Just wanted to kind of contextualize how much of the operating ratio improvement you could've gotten in addition to what you did if you had a sort of cleaner quarter. Frank Lonegro : Hi, Chris; Frank. Yes, we obviously experienced some transitional issues in the first part of the quarter as we transitioned into operating plan over the July 4th holiday. And as you know, any time you've got a network-related set of changes to target quantify the dollar impact of that you do see on the revenue side the impacts of that transition really muted the top line growth if you compare us to our peers. We probably left some demand on the ground. We probably saw some temporal shifts of business to either truck or to other rails. We do expect, as you heard Hunter say in his opening, we do expect that to come back pretty quickly. And then on the expense side, any time your network is a little sluggish you're going to see higher overtime, re-crews, fuel car hire that nature, but not something that we're able to put a pinpoint type of an estimate. But it certainly did impact us both from an operating income and operating ratio perspective in the quarter. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. Hunter, I know you've commented some on the -- kind of the network and how it's running. I wondered if you could give a bit more perspective in terms of is the car load schedule pretty much stable at this point? How would you think about the trajectory? I don't want to be overly focused on the metrics, velocity and dwell and so forth. But sometimes they help to see how the network is running. So is it stable at this point? Would you expect to see further momentum build, that the metrics improve and costs fall out further. Just kind of where you're at in terms of the network and the trajectory today? Hunter Harrison : Sure. Tom, we have not completed -- if you remember back a little bit from our early experiences with installing these trip plans, that effort is not complete. Now we're much further along that I thought we'd be, but I would think that we're probably 85% there. And I think that by mid-year '18, it will have everything fully in place with the plans. And that means that the plans to some degree will be upgraded where it's required and necessary and the market is asking for it. As we develop the ability with our train speed and dwell time, our dwell time is, as we speak today, as I look at the [indiscernible] board, it is down to about 10 to 12 hours, which is pretty impressive overall. Our productivity cars per hour has improved even more so, which even further shows the ability we have, so the train speed, the true velocity has picked up pretty significantly. So I guess what it does is it looks and says, the scouting report we did, we have even more [technical difficulty] than now that we're going to kind of be able to produce the results that have been talked about over the next four year. Now the timing within that four-year time frame might adjust a little bit up or down. But I think that -- I won\u2019t get ahead of myself for a couple of weeks. I just think that the opportunities are very bright going forward. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. Thank you for the response. Hunter Harrison : Thank you. Your next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Your line is open; you may ask your question. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. Hunter, I wanted to ask if you though the customer and employee response to the changes that you're implementing, and the resulting dislocation, has that led you to rethink any of the elements of precision railroading as it applies to the CSX network? And is there anything that you need to do differently or that we should be thinking about for CSX relative to what we observed at CP or CN? Hunter Harrison : No, I don't think so. I think that the only one little caveat I would put there is this, look, this model in my view will work here as well as work -- or has worked anywhere and even more so. I do think that potentially maybe we learned a little bit that even here the personnel and the execution and the selection of people is even more important. And so, I think we are kind of fine-tuning that a little bit. If you look at -- I'm not - I don't say this critically; people think of all different ways, but we have a lot of people, a lot of operating supervisors that were hired have got seven to eight years of experience off the campus, put in the operating world as Assistant Train Master, and that's asking a whole lot of them to be able to do that. And so, I think we are going back to do some retraining. We started back again last two weeks ago I think, Hunter Camp, [indiscernible] the Board asked me about Hunter Camp, and I said, \"You know, I am just not sure -- I'm going to have time to do this.\" And I learned it quickly. And they quickly told me you don't have time not to do it. And so, we had the first four sessions, I believe, they were a knockout success. And so, I guess the main thing Allison is the view of the personnel -- I think we talked about this term, but I think we\u2019ve got a lot of internal talent that's covered up with mud, and I think we've taken a hose, washed some people down, and we found some rock stars here. So, that's very encouraging. Allison Landry : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Good morning. Hunter, I guess, there is really no one that implements precision railroading as quickly as effectively as you. There is a feeling that your ability to do this has been in large part due to the hands-on nature of your involvement sort of walking the track, so to speak, if you could just talk about that in the context of the turnaround at CSX in terms of your ability or inability to spend time with the rank and file and drive changes at a grassroots level to the extent you had in the past and previous turnaround, any insights there I think would be helpful. Thank you. Hunter Harrison : Well, look, I'm not 45years old anymore. I wish I was, for a lot of reasons, but I cannot -- I have been a few years and probably not for me to say, but I mean hands-on. But I've written a lot of books and papers and case studies, and so forth. I receive a lot of correspondence from people trying to understand even more concepts. I think our team starts to get it. And I think one thing that we talked about with the camp was this, I'm not as much as I would like to be able to, I'm not able to get to everybody myself individually to sit with them, but I can hopefully be expecting that I am developing the cycles. Let's say, look this makes sense, this is not just some stone up on the wall, this has got a lot to it to make sense and it will work, and they will buy into it now, and so I need to be able to do that more so through my team and [indiscernible] team and lieutenants, they maybe have done in the past and maybe I should have done it more in the past, but if I can do it myself, I did it myself, and I didn't bring them in the fold. So, if you say I have to optimize it, maybe didn\u2019t optimize it, but I did this, we are going to get -- we'll get to the same type results. They might like to look a little different, but the results are going to be there. Amit Mehrotra : Got it. Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you very much for answering my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Ravi Shankar : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Hunter, in your slides, you pointed out that the, that the 4Q outlet has about 50% of your end markets of the favorable outlook versus I think those 66% last quarter. Not the still anyways under from the Analyst Day but just broadly speaking as you kind of look at your long term or an efficiency targets for CSX, how much do kind of end markets feature or kind of how much of role do they play and actually hitting that and end markets are slowing, what's the offset to that? Thanks. Frank Lonegro : Hi, Ravi, it's Frank. Obviously we'll share lot more with you in a couple of weeks when we get to the Investor conference, the top line growth is certainly part of the future but on a proportional basis I would tell you that the expense lines really important to the future and if you go back and you look at what Hunter has done at CN and CP that's an important part of the future and making sure that we drive productivity saving the upper ratio lower but we certainly are focused on growing the top line as well. Hunter Harrison : Yes, let me just give you outlook; I will just give you preview or segway here into their market to the Analyst Day. Gone through [indiscernible] wisdom, the results that we've achieved so-called those turnaround, well first of all, we weren't sensitive to the market which was wrong with improve revenue at opening places, but we were successful net, net in all three places and so like did, there is not in end markets that's stopped with the bottom line approach is here. We have never -- we have always gone into right wrong, we always gone into in everyone of the turnaround with the strength that concerned approach from the other illustrations, my life is always that we went there and they had a growth there of 11%. I didn't see it and I didn't understand it but they frankly did it. We had 3%. So, we had 3% on the bottom line they did with top line they got 11% that when all said and done our operating the ratio was 24 year per with four points then their number so but you have been implied with these numbers all you want the bottom line to bottom line. Ravi Shankar : Great, thank you. Hunter Harrison : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Ben Hartford : Hi, good morning everyone. Just in the contact center everything you talked about with regard to the cadence of the operating plan want us to pull through when do you think you would be able to extract value in the former price from the service that you build into the network obviously as we're looking to 18 truckload capacity is tightened up away more favorable pricing environment is result of that across the market but when do you expect to be able to realize extracting value in the former price at CSX from these changes is that 1920 backend-loaded type of process. Hunter Harrison : I think it's are in my view is more of a -- what the competition does, yes. Competition is adversely tough and if the competition does price and improve their service, it will have impact on us, so we can ignore, but not solve it, if you think -- what do you think is going to happen, I think that we will start to see 1918, okay necessarily to a degree that maybe we describe, but I think in 19', we will start to make nice reasonable pickups of price relatively service and that as we continue that and move into 20' and beyond. We will be rewarded for that good service and profit. I mean, when -- if you got a good service or better, I think we will have better in the future, okay and you have the low cost carrier, you got a lot of average, you go after you get the same service level, okay if your cost is higher about 10%, it's tough, it's damn tough. I don't think this organization has the ability to try and do that, but I think we would be able [indiscernible] or whatever I will tell you that markets that I even built a lot, but that's just kind of an additional thought if you will. Ben Hartford : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : My next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. You may ask your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. In looking at your volumes in the third quarter, I'm curious which segments you think were most impacted by some of the challenges that you encountered during the quarter and in particular, how much you think the intermodal network was impacted particularly as you were on boarding in new international intermodal customer during the quarter? Fredrik Eliasson : Yes, this is Fredrik. I think we saw impact on all our markets in the third quarter from the challenge and of course also the hurricane impact of Irma, so I mean I think it was pretty wide spread, but it's hard to pinpoint clearly we had benefit of onboarding two new customers intermodal space and also continue to see opportunities to convert things off the highway system as the market has tightened and so we feel good about where it is and I think you are already seeing as Hunter alluded to you as Hunter - as service now return and it is much stronger you are seeing the kind of weaker number that comes out, that indicates that we are back and the customers are coming back to us very rapidly. Frank Lonegro : Hi, Cherilyn; Frank, I will just add a little bit on the hurricane to make sure that it can be [indiscernible] for folks probably about $0.02 in the quarter, most that being top line or a lot of that was [technical difficulty] there we had some plan shutdown in the Southeast or in some cases a couple of them -- in one particular case a couple of weeks, so as you think about the transition impact service side, you also have to remember we also had hurricane in the middle of that. Cherilyn Radbourne : Good. Frank Lonegro : Some cost in the third quarter, which are part of that $0.02, the [indiscernible] and over time, everybody was pulling over time, we have some third-party contractors in there and we probably have a little bit of trickle over a cost into the fourth quarter, single digit millions when invoice is coming in October. But I just want to make sure, we dimensionalize that for everybody. Cherilyn Radbourne : That's helpful and that's my one. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Scott Group : Hi, thanks. Good morning guys. So why don't you ask coal yield spell, I think 7% sequentially, how much of that is sort of the mix of net and thermal and export and how much of that maybe is from just lower net export pricing? And then, if I can just ask as Hunter, we had a noisy third quarter. So can you maybe calibrate headcount and operating ratio expectations for the fourth quarter? David Baggs : Scott, you are breaking the rules; one question. Scott Group : So, let me tell you the first part in terms of the coal, it's clearly the second quarter was a very strong quarter as you saw on the indexes and so that certainly helped the net deals and yes there is a little bit of a mix change as well because the thermal market, the export market has gone stronger. So I think you are losing both of them and both of them are my drivers of that. Frank Lonegro : On the operating ratio, Scott; Hunter could chime in on the headcount, but in terms of the operating ratio I mean year-to-date were 66.7, Q4 will be better than Q3 obviously and you know, what our guidance is and you can get pretty close on Q4. Scott Group : Yes, and in fact the headcount number is I think projecting year-end will be 4500. Hunter Harrison : Yes on a year-to-date basis full year against where we ended 2016 total headcount in that 4500 range you heard, let's talk about the 4000, I think the number at the end of Q3 was like 4200 and that's again that's all and that's management union plus contractors and consultants. Frank Lonegro : I guess the only other thing I will ask is we'll talk at the Analyst Meeting, there has been a lot of noise and a lot of things happening but I'm not sure that they would fourth quarter is going to reflect, I think if you this is the long story in fourth quarter and it's the long story exciting and if you are sitting there on your seat waiting for fourth quarter results, you might fall off your chair for results. David Baggs : Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Jeff Kauffman of Aegis Capital; you may ask your question. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much. Just a quick merchant or group question on auto, I think a lot of us were surprised to see an 18 auto SAR in the most recent months and we've heard stories that maybe 0.5 million cars plus might have been lost and the strong impacts of Houston and a little more in Florida, could we be underestimating auto and if there is a rebound or secularly, we've talked about how autos. The outlook is not right but I was really surprised by the most recent monthly SAR and I'm just talking some folks in Texas and they were saying a lot of autos need to be replaced. Frank Lonegro : Yes I think that's a good question, we certainly have seen a fair amount of inventory drawdown and because it's back to kind of a more normalized level layer year-over-year, which hasn't benefit previously in the year, so that's a good sign. I think production numbers for next year indicates about 200,000 more vehicles, they were seeing this year. So I think there is some - there could be an opportunity there. I certainly know that our automotive network is running well and within a merchandize network and so we are seeing some pretty strong and write now we will see ultimately how much of a impact it has but it certainly has been helpful. Jeff Kauffman : Okay. That's my one. See you guys in few weeks. Thanks. Hunter Harrison : Well, the one number I thought here today that was in fact get your attention is that. I think certainly general motor is selling a steady old car 24% of the cars. The rest of the other type vehicles, so now I just talk about SUVs and the whole thing, it's one thing but if you talk about cars there is great slippage, which the implication start to be for that car [technical difficulty] if it's a new models and et cetera, but that's gets specifically not the case. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you, Hunter. Operator : Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open. You may ask your question. David Vernon : Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the time. Fredrik, maybe a question for you on the long-term in a motor dynamic, if you look at the business, the RPU today is kind of where it was in the 2005 timeframe, volumes have been grown quite a bit. As we look out of the next five or ten years, should we be expecting more of a volume growth story in intermodal or a little bit of pricing as well and what should drive the change in that market dynamic? Fredrik Eliasson : Maybe I think as just the way Frank said earlier, we will address many of these questions specifically as part of the analyst conference. Clearly we think there is an opportunity to continue to convert traffic off the highway system and it's going to come in the form of either price or volume depending over the market is, how tight the market is and what the service offerings are but nothing has fundamentally changed in the premise that you see in over last decades, where we've been able to convert at a pace of 5% to 7% a year on average and as we look forward, we see no difference as we implement this operating model, we think we should have an even better chance of doing that. David Vernon : As far as the rate of volume take versus share take, I mean in the long run the RPUs are still running kind of where they were a decade ago, should we expect that as a market I tell you exactly we will be able to get a little bit more price and power? Does this remain a competitive market where it's going to be more volume? Frank Lonegro : I think this should have better pricing power as well as we continue to improve the service product. The one of the things with the model obviously as we have continued to drive train length and other productivity initiatives. The top line might not have reflected what you've seen in some other markets, the bottom line half as we have really significant increase in train length, terminal productivity, double stack clearance et cetera. And we are not just in motor but across all markets very, very focused on making sure that every car loaded [technical difficulty] unit pays for itself. And that's going to be the continued focus as well. David Vernon : All right, thanks for the time. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from John Larkin with Stifel. Your line is open. You may ask your question. John Larkin : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to dig into the utility coal volumes which took quite a haircut year-over-year, where do those stockpile stand? And when do you think that will stabilize? We will see perhaps more and more stability in utility coal volumes? Frank Lonegro : Yes, I think as we think about the fourth quarter, I would say that we are going to be overall in domestic coal roughly flat. What we saw here in the third quarter is probably the best expectation. In terms of actual stockpile, I would say at this point, the stockpile in the North are probably higher than we would like to see. But in the south, they are probably little bit below. So it gives an opportunity to replenish some of those in the South, which is usually a longer length of haul high revenue because of the length of haul. In addition to that just to remind you, at the beginning of the year, we had a very short haul business contract that we lost in utility coal. We indicated I think about 6 million tons are so and that's been with us for the full year and will be with us in the fourth quarter as well. But beyond that, I think we are seeing a market that is in pretty good safe. Clearly the summer was not helpful, but we are still seeing natural gas prices around three which is much \u2013-- very helpful -- like that we are in the higher, but it's certainly more helpful than what we saw in the last spring. John Larkin : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. You may ask your question. Bascome Majors : Yes, so from your longer-term shareholder succession planning is pretty important issue here as the situation is really very different from CP where you really had an heir apparent a few months into it. So Hunter, I was curious if you could comment a little bit on the timeline for the Board deciding who is going to lead CSX after you retire, and any signpost that we as investors should watch for on this front along the way? Hunter Harrison : Well, I am -- that is something that the Board is very sensitive to, and as me and other working on -- and not something to worry, no worry, and I am hopeful that maybe we could give you more insight. Again, it's me but I am not sure, okay. But all I can say is this -- I am saying what you are saying. We share your concerns. I share your concerns both as CEO and a shareholder. And it's something that we will -- until we receive an answer, we will stay on top of [technical difficulty] in grand way. Operator : Thanks. Are you ready for the next question? That comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. You may ask your question. Jason Seidl : Hey, thank you. Frank, real quick, when you talked a little bit about what the hurricane cost you in the quarter, you did a good job of parsing it off. Can you talk a little bit about potential rebuilding that you might benefit from in Q4 and maybe even possibly beyond? Frank Lonegro : Sure. For the Chairman as well that obviously as Florida rebuilds, as Texas rebuilds, there can certainly be end markets that can benefit from additional volumes and types of products that we ultimately haul. So yes, I mean I think there are certainly some possibility of some demand uptick. It really depends on how quickly these folks are able to rebuild in those areas. But anything that helps the end markets is ultimately going to help CSX. Fredrik Eliasson : I agree. And I mean I think we are also the impact on the trucking market itself. It allows us to participate in some of those that we -- otherwise, we wouldn't and also covert things [indiscernible] model solution and of course building products. And we talked earlier about vehicles being replenished. So I think there are some opportunities out there for us to capture. Jason Seidl : And are you seeing that occur right now, Fredrik? Fredrik Eliasson : I am clearing seeing that the truck market tightening. We're certainly seeing that. I think it's little bit early to see in terms of building products. But we have certainly seen some of the vehicle opportunities just based on the need to replant or see what inventory levels are and how quickly that come down. So that's been very helpful. Jason Seidl : Okay, that's my one. Thanks for your time as always. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. My question is on Frank \u2013- on free cash flow for Frank and the buyback that's coming from it. You noted in your guidance you got 1.5 billion guidance, but you are kind of there already and three quarters in and you've made a quite a move on your buyback here this quarter. So are we just being conservative on this? And are you expecting kind of flat free cash flow through the back half? And how should we look at your share buyback momentum as a result of that free cash flow going forward? Frank Lonegro : Sure. On your -- the last part of your question, we'll certainly have some more information for you as we get to the investor conference on shareholders returns and capital allocation in a couple of weeks. In terms of the free cash flow, obviously we had a nice benefit in the third quarter by deferring the tax payment. And we will make good on those payments in December. So the fourth quarter is generally a lighter free cash flow quarter. But at the same time we are already at 1.56 billion even if you look at the fourth quarter if I were betting then I'll take the over. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Justin Long Stephens. You may ask your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. So I wanted to ask about export coals since it's recently held up a bit better than expected. Do you have any early thoughts about the export coal in 2018? And just looking longer term as you think about the structural positioning of your network, how are you thinking about the role export coal will play? Frank Lonegro : We will certainly cover that as part of our investor conference. We feel we are very well-positioned strategically in terms of our ability to reach the port both on East Coast and in the gulf. And we think we have an excellent service, product, and good facility [technical difficulty] key export players. We feel good about it. We feel good about where we are for the remaining of this year. And obviously where the forward curve seems to be right now, it's a good opportunity for the U.S. producer to participate next year as well. But, we will give you more color as we get to the investor conference. Justin Long : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I turn the call over to the speakers for closing remarks. Hunter Harrison : Well, thanks very much. I hope that we were able to fill in some blanks and at the same time not get ahead of ourselves with our Analyst Day coming up which we are -- the group here is working very hard on. There were some questions before the organization that you have framed very well for us. And those are things that we will be looking at and try to be responsive to. And look forward to seeing you again. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's telephone conference. Thanks for your participation in today's call. And you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Boone, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. Thank you sir, please begin. Kevin Boone : Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Joining me on today\u2019s call is Jim Foote, Chief Executive Officer, Ed Harris, Executive Vice-President of Operations and Frank Lonegro Chief Financial Officer On slide two with our forward-looking disclosure followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on slide three. I would also like to highlight our upcoming investor conference scheduled for March 1st in New York. Registration information will be found on the CSX Investor Relations page. With that, it is a pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. James Foote : Thank you very much Kevin. It\u2019s great to have the opportunity to speak with you again today. Before we get started and going through the presentation, I\u2019d like to thank all of you out there who sent their condolences concerning Hunter\u2019s passing. Hunter was a true legend and CSX would not be in a position it is today without the tremendous changes that he was able to make during his time here. I am committed to seeing his vision through and making CSX the best railroad of North America. Before I get started, let me say again that as I said in the conference call on the morning of December 15 when I was named acting President and CEO. I am committed to follow through on implementing the scheduled railroad business model at CSX. After spending my entire career in the railroad business, I have experienced firsthand the benefits that are realized by customers and shareholders and changing to the scheduled railroad way of doing business. To reinforce my commitment to driving this change, I took steps quickly to emphasize this message. Just a few hours after assuming the position in my first official act as CEO, I advised the head of engineering to bulldoze one of the hump yards that Hunter had closed. Atlanta hump yard today is flat. There is no turning back. I did make changes to the sales and marketing structure to simplify the organization by collapsing the leadership group into three business units and aligning certain functions into other departments. I made changes in the operating department to bring clarity to the key responsibilities. The operating department both at the staff and field levels obviously has the most responsibility to execute and deliver the efficiencies and service improvements from schedule railroading. While we now have more accountability within the operating department to ensure the hard work to implement schedule railroading gift to the bottom line. And the biggest change is to bring in Ed Harris to help me. Ed is a rock solid railroad operations executive with over 44 years of experience. He and I were part of the leadership team that transformed Canadian National. He worked for years with Hunter at both Illinois Central and CN developing and implementing scheduled railroading. He understands what we are trying to accomplish here at CSX and I trust with Ed\u2019s help we can deliver on the plan. We have a ton of opportunity to harvest. We are aggressively developing more trip plans that have a essence to operating the railroad to schedule. Plans that set specific wealth and time parameters and dictate how to move our customer\u2019s products across the network, but also tell us when we don\u2019t which highlights inefficiencies. We are on the right path to making CSX the best run railroad in North America. I\u2019d like to go into the presentation now and am going to start with slide four, the fourth quarter highlights. We continued where we delivered solid results in the fourth quarter. We continue to show a sequential improvement on key service metrics including train velocity and terminal dwell. Here are the highlights. Adjusted revenue on a 13-week basis was roughly flat year-over-year with volume down 2%. Our adjusted operating ratio came in at 64.8%, a 220 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Earnings per share were up 31% to $0.64. Moving onto the next page, where we can take a quick look at the revenue in the fourth quarter. Again in the quarter revenue was flat and a 2% decline in volume, this reflects higher prices which were offset somewhat by negative mix. A few comments on the larger commodity goods. In Chemicals, revenue growth was up 3% despite lower industrial waste moves due to a large project which concluded earlier in 2017 but was still active in the fourth quarter of 2016. Crude by rail moves were also down in the period. Auto was down 10% about in line with a 7% lower U.S. and 15% lower Canadian vehicle production rate. Ag and Food products revenues were down 5% driven by lower export grain which was down about 50%. Feed ingredients which were down \u2013 which was again offset somewhat by increases in feed grains. Coal revenues were up 4%, export coal volumes finished out a strong year up 37% for the quarter. Shipments through our Northern utilities were down substantially, but shipments through southern utilities were up 5%. Intermodal revenues grew 4%. International volumes increased as Eastern port volumes continue to grow. Our domestic business was down as a business rationalization program shed about 7% of total intermodal volumes, which were offset somewhat by strong peak season volumes. Again moving to slide seven and take a quick look at our operating highlights. Again, as I mentioned previously train velocity and dwell continue to see sequential improvement. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, train velocity was 15% better and Dwell was 10% better. While there remains to be a tremendous amount of opportunity ahead of us, I\u2019m encouraged by our progress. Train length continues to be a focus by our team and I would expect future improvements there. Finally, total employees continue to fall this quarter as we improve efficiency which requires fewer assets. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank. Frank Lonegro : Thanks Jim and good afternoon everyone. Turning to slide nine, we are encouraged by the fourth quarter\u2019s financial performance. The service and efficiency improvements Jim just laid out on the previous slide have generated momentum on the financial side as well. Reported revenue declined 6% but was flat on a comparable 13-week basis despite some gains across all markets and higher fuel recoveries were offset by the impact of lower volume and negative mix. Total expenses were 14% lower in the quarter, driven primarily by significant efficiency gains that benefit the tax reform on the company\u2019s equity affiliates and cycling $116 million of cost [indiscernible] last years extra fiscal week. While I don\u2019t plan to call out the impact of the extra week as I walk through the expense line items, we have provided that level of detail in our quarterly financial report. Labor and Fringe savings were driven by a 12% reduction in average headcount, incentive compensation was also lower driven in part by the reversal [Ph] about $28 million in former CEO stock option expense accrued in quarters one through three. MS&O expense increased by 5%. As a reminder though, fourth quarter 2016 MS&O benefitted in a $115 million real estate gain which was partly offset by real estate gains in this year\u2019s fourth quarter as well as $70 million of efficiency savings. Fuel expense was up primarily due to the 23% increase in the per gallon price despite continued gains in fuel efficiency. The $29 million restructuring charge in the quarter and legislature [ph] departures of seven executives in early 2017 and those more recently. Equity earnings of affiliates is the new line item on the income statement, necessitated by the impact of tax reform on non-consolidated subsidiaries in the quarter. As we have done at the CSX consolidated level, the subsidiaries also will be valued their differed tax liabilities to reflect the new federal way. Given the size of the impact this quarter, SEC rules require us to add these line items to the P&L. Moving forward, this item should be an expense credit of about $10 million to $15 million per quarter four. These contra expenses were previously for MS&O and rents. Looking below the operating income line, 2016 results were impacted by a debt refinancing which lowered ongoing interest expense and were accompanied by onetime $115 million debt repurchase charge. Shifting to the income tax line, in 2017 we received a $3.5 billion non-cash benefit due to the revaluation of our deferred tax liability. Adjusting for this and for the restructuring charge our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 34%. This is lower than usual due to the previously mentioned stock option expense reversal and multiple state tax items and favourably impacted EPS collectively by about $0.03. The deferred tax revaluation and the restructuring charges are significant and we believe are not indicative of CSX\u2019s future financial churns, therefore on slide ten and in that quarterly financial reports we provide adjusted non-GAAP measures for the fourth quarter and full year. The fourth quarter adjusted operating ratio was 64.8% and adjusted EPS grew to about 31% to $0.64 per share. In the full year, we achieved a 66.3% adjusted operating ratio an improvement of 310 basis points from 2016, the improved operating and financial performance and the benefit of share repurchases bring full year adjusted EPS to $2.30 a 27% increase over the last years reported EPS. Looking at slide 11, adjusting for the restructuring charge, CSX generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow before dividends doubling the free cash flow performance of 2016, improves cash generation as driven by a $665 million reduction in capital expenditures as well as solid top line gains and significant operating efficiency savings. 2017\u2019s initial capital investment plan was $2.2 billion. With Hunter\u2019s guidance during the year we\u2019ve reduced that to $2.1 billion and ultimately finished closer to $2 billion for the year, a 25% decrease year-over-year. Continuing with this capital efficiency theme, Jim will provide his thoughts on 2018 capital investment in a few moments. Our strong free cash flow performance enabled us to reward our shareholders with a two [Indiscernible] share dividend increase over to this year of nearly $2 billion of share repurchases. In total, we returned nearly $2.7 billion to our shareholders in 2017, an increase of over $900 million compared to 2016. Wrapping up on slide 12, a strong finish to the year enabled us to meet or exceed all of the financial targets we reaffirmed on last quarter\u2019s earnings call delivering on our commitments will be a hallmark of this team and this company. In addition to growing adjusted EPS by 27% doubling free cash flow to $1.7 billion and driving the adjusted operating ratio down to 66.3% our successful transition to persistent schedule railroad helped the company generate record efficiency savings of $460 million in 2017. With 2017 now into books, I\u2019m delighted to turn the presentation back to Jim to highlight our initial expectations for 2018. James Foote : Thanks, Frank. For 2018 on the concluding slide here we expect revenue in 2018 to be up slightly with merchandising intermodal services offerings much better than last year. I expect to see more favourable results in the second half of the year. In the first half of the year, we will face tough comparisons on export coal rates which are linked to the price of the commodity. However, we see the coal markets continuing to remain healthy from a volume perspective. As we continue to improve our service, I believe we will begin to see increasing new opportunities as we look beyond 2018. I continue to expect improvement from a cross perspective. I reiterate we will continue to implement the scheduling railroading model and I see no reason to believe we can\u2019t deliver the results that Hunter thought we could. We should see a solid step-down in the operating ratio every year for the next three years. I expect CapEx to be $1.6 billion down significantly from 2017; this is bang on where Hunter said we should be. I am committed to investing and maintaining a safe and reliable railroad. As we become more efficient, we are able to achieve more with each dollar we spend. As Kevin said, we have scheduled our investor day for March 1. We will provide additional details in our financial outlook at that time. I hope all of you can attend and look forward to meeting with you and discussing our plans in much greater detail at that time. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Kevin and we can have question and answers. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Jim. In the interest of trying to get to everyone in the queue, I\u2019ll ask our analysts to limit themselves to one question and a follow up if needed. Operator, we\u2019ll now take questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Your line is open. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good afternoon. I had some questions for Ed. Is Ed on the call today, Ed Harris, sir? Edward Harris : Yes, I am Tom. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. Good to hear your voice Ed and you know look forward to I guess hearing from you as part of the team. I know you haven\u2019t been there long so it\u2019s probably tough to have a strong read on things but I just wanted to hear your thoughts on what do you think is important to big changes in the network last year, the metric seemed to be very good at the present time, but what do you think are the most important things for you and the team to focus on the operating side to continue that momentum and to see the further improvement in financial result? Edward Harris : Well Tom, I think it\u2019s obvious what Jim said. We are going to continue to follow Hunter\u2019s plan of pursuing a scheduled railroad environment that in turn will lead to less train starts, more engines and storage, less equipment and a more fluid network and the table has been set. I read in one of Jim\u2019s earlier reports that the heavy lifting has been done and I really agree that it has been done. I\u2019ve been very impressed with the staff here at CSX, the field forces I\u2019ve had a chance to meet all my direct reports and now I am spending time with their staffs and just get the handle on the railroad. I\u2019ll start hitting the field here probably within the next two weeks and follow through on the plan, but the plan is intact as it stands right now but I think we\u2019ll dig a lot deeper than now where we are at today. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, that\u2019s great. And Jim, if I can ask you to give your thoughts on just what the top priorities for execution in 2018 would be for you as well. James Foote : You know Ed and I are in complete alignment. We both think alike and we both think and speak Hunter. This is the way we learn how to run the railroad so we are going to do the same things. Train length, velocity, terminal dwell continue to focus on driving down our fuel expenditure and you know running our trains with fewer locomotives. Car miles per car day, you know we just \u2013 we live and eat and breathe these metrics and that\u2019s how you deliver the financial performance that we did at CN and Hunter did at CP. So it might sound boring Tom, but it\u2019s the same old, same old that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ve heard all along and we are well on the way to accomplishing that. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. All right thank you for the time. Operator : The next question will come from Brian Ossenbeck of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Brian Ossenbeck : Hi guys thanks for taking my question. Jim, just wanted to start where we ended up, I think if you could just give a little bit more framework around the 2018 financial outlook knowing you are going to discuss a lot more for the long term at the coming investor day but if you can just breakout what you think will be the major components of the revenue up slightly, you are going to continue to it sounds like churns in the intermodal volumes. You\u2019re looking for perhaps some volume headwinds and then just more specifically on the OR guidance looking for another solid step-down this year and every year for the next several years if you can give us a little bit more detail on that, you know what that looks like if it\u2019s similar year to this year or is it going to kind of continue but at a slower rate from 2017? James Foote : Well Kevin will shoot me if I give away all of the details that he\u2019s got planned for New York. But just again a little more flavour on what I said in my concluding slide. It is not the topline growth up slightly. It is kind of similar to what we\u2019ve been through at CN and CP when you implement a new operating plan and you implement it as quickly and aggressively as Hunter did here. Clearly there was disruption in the network and if some business clearly went away. Then there was the intentional [indiscernible] marketing of the 7% of the intermodal traffic when we deviated and pivoted away from the hub-and-spoke system and closed the Northwest Ohio facility. I do not envision those kinds of disruptive changes occurring in the future in 2018 and so our goal right now on the merchandise side of the business is to earn back the trust of our customers and to begin to grow that business and so because it was only a few months ago, we were in gridlock and fighting with the customers and the [STB] [Ph] you know it would be naive to me to assume that all that business is going to come back to us in the second week of February. So as I said later in the year I think we\u2019ll begin to have more success in growing our merchandise business segment but I\u2019m being cautious in our forecast. Intermodal side of the house, again as our service metrics improve, I expect to see that comeback, we were successful in offsetting that 7% decline with a very strong fourth quarter especially the service that we deliver during peak season. So I would hope that intermodal will continue to do well and I personally have been meeting with a lot of the major intermodal customers and confident that we can see some topline growth. The kind of odd ball in the equation here is what\u2019s going to happen with coal. Coal is very strong here for us, the outlook for export Met and Steam coal right now continues to be favourable despite everyone predicting earlier that it was not going to be, and so the question is how long is that going to hang in there and the challenges that we have with our domestic steam co-franchise especially the northern utilities where they are being displaced by natural gas gives us concern there. So again, we\u2019ll get into all of that topline in much greater detail with the business unit leaders at our investor conference, so there\u2019s a little flavour there. On the operating side, as I said you know I see no reason and Ed agrees with me as he said, I see no reason that we cannot drive our cost structure lower and improve the efficiencies of the network in line with what Hunter had visioned and as I said again I see step-downs, I can see step-downs in that operating ratio over the year and next three years. The details in which how we get there from a train operating standpoint, from an engineering standpoint to the mechanical standpoint, the timing of those in a little more, in much greater detail with more flavour will roll out again so Kevin won\u2019t shoot me if I just blurted out the plan right now. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, thanks for all the details Jim. A really quick one for Frank, if he could just tell us where you expect cash taxes to go relative to last year and then versus the 25 effective rates I would appreciate it? Thank you. Frank Lonegro : Thanks Brian. We gave you the effective rate obviously in Jim\u2019s prepared remarks, remember obviously as you step down into the cash tax way from there you are going to have the essentially equivalent to 100% bonus depreciation and then you\u2019ve got your state accommodation of cash and deferred. I think if you implied the same level of slip if you saw previously on a lower base you\u2019ll get to the right answer. It\u2019s going to fluctuate as it always does quarter-to-quarter, and year-to-year but that will give you a good place to start. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Allison Landry : Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Jim, I was hoping I could ask a follow up question on Intermodal and you know given that you are essentially awarded the credit for building the CN intermodal franchise as we know it today. Do you see anything at CSX you know understanding the fact that it\u2019s at a different spot and you know where CN was years ago. Is there any opportunity to build out CSX\u2019s franchise in a similar way or do you plan to take it in a different direction altogether? James Foote : Well there is a lot more people in New York and Pennsylvania then there are into schedules and so I think we have an opportunity to move a lot more intermodal or right across the network. I see it\u2019s just like we see in the rest of the business I see a lot of opportunity in terms of changing business processes, working at improving terminal fluidity, the same steps that we took at CN to improve the quality of the network and then the quality of the revenue stream associated with that. I also see a somewhat uniquely and opportunity here to really take a hard look at the input international track that\u2019s coming in on the east coast and begin to determine ways in which we can market that business more effectively on east to west move and be more competitive there, and I believe my experience in growing the traffic flows on the CN out of Vancouver as well as the development, Prince Rupert will give me a little bit more insight into where to take the business. But first and foremost what we did at CN where we rolled out intermodal excellence and created an unbelievably sought-after service in Canada, that\u2019s our first focus and I think we\u2019re making great progress in delivering on that. Allison Landry : Okay, great. And then, I apologize if I missed this, but did you guys provide the core pricing figure for the quarter? James Foote : Not in the specifics. What I said was that on a network basis clearly their volume was down 2%, our revenues were flat. We achieved greater than net 2% differential in price and that was offset to a degree by mix. Allison Landry : Okay. So, will you not be providing the similar like the same disclosure that you guys previously did? James Foote : I think we\u2019re going to providing disclosure at the same way I use to do at CN. Allison Landry : Okay. James Foote : And that\u2019s kind of how we \u2013 that\u2019s the guidance level that we\u2019re comfortable with. Allison Landry : Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Group : Hey, thanks afternoon. Just a couple of follow-ups on the 2018 earnings framework, so Jim can you just clarify, I mean, fuel surcharge is probably a two, maybe a three-point help to revenue this year. Are you including that in your commentary about revenue up slightly or you sort of talking ex-fuel? And then maybe Jim or Ed can you give some sort of directional color on headcount for either the first quarter or for the year? Frank Lonegro : Hey, Scott. It\u2019s Frank. I\u2019ll jump in and then Jim and Ed can go. The revenue guidance that Jim gave is all in revenue, total revenue. And then headcount revenue comes on a Q1 basis, although I believe it will be sequentially down every quarter. You\u2019re going to see us step down pretty much every year 17 to 18, 8 to 19, 19 to 20 etcetera. We\u2019ll have a lot more commentary on that one as we get to the investor day, but clearly that\u2019s part of equation to get to some of the outcomes that we\u2019re aiming for. Scott Group : And Frank, do you\u2026 Frank Lonegro : Go ahead, I\u2019m sorry. Scott Group : No. Go ahead. Sorry to interrupt. Frank Lonegro : On the headcount question, you know as we \u2013 as this is our quarterly information, well I should say, what\u2019s in our quarterly information is a employee headcount, but in addition to the employee headcount reduction we also had a significant reduction in the number of pay consultants that were here at CSX and you add the consultants together with the employee number that\u2019s in there. We took out over 4,700 employees here and consultants last year. Looking at next year if you take a look at what the ongoing attrition rate is around the company, of around say, on remaining headcount around 1,400 employees and then you add in again an aggressive look at getting the consultants non-employees out of here, you would think that we would come up with an annual number of around another 2,000 employee reduction in 2018. That\u2019s our thoughts right now. We are grinding that \u2013 again grinding that plan right now and expect to have the details of that mix between employees, consultants, timing based upon attrition etcetera when we are in New York in six weeks. Scott Group : Very helpful. I just want to make sure I understand, Frank, the way you answered my first question is about the surcharge revenue. So obviously your revenue includes you surcharge revenue. Do you think I\u2019m right that there\u2019s a two to three-point potential help to revenue this year from that? So you sort of saying x fuel that core revenue is potentially down this year? Is that sort of what we should take from your guidance? Frank Lonegro : Your two to three percentage point seems high to me, I mean, we\u2019re tracking the forward curve and obviously have a good handle on what surcharge revenue would be on a year-over-year basis, but Jim\u2019s comment was obviously on a total revenue basis as we get to the investor conference we can get the more around CAGRs in terms of longer term revenue growth etcetera, but now Jim commentary result. James Foote : Yes. That numbers is high based upon our assumption of what we expect a fuel price to be. Scott Group : Okay. Fair enough. James Foote : As Frank said, it\u2019s all and it includes fuel surcharges included in that number, but we\u2019re no where near any kind of fuel price assumption increase that would drive that kind of increase in revenue. Scott Group : Okay. Fair enough. And then my just last question. I don\u2019t know if this is for Jim or for Frank. So as we think about the CapEx reduction and the earnings improvement and taxes, obviously much more free cash flow this year than we'd ever seen. So, how you would prioritize that free cash flow between buyback and dividend? And do you think just this new level of free cash flow let you revisit leverage targets? I know we\u2019re not going to get those hard numbers today. We\u2019ll get them at the Analyst Day. But we right in thinking that more free cash flow let you think about leverage ratios differently? Edward Harris : Well, it certainly gives you more coverage in terms of interest ratios and things like that. Its an input obviously that we\u2019re having with the more as we look it up to capital structure and leverage conversations with the rating agencies coming up as well to understand the relative importance of debt to EBITDA versus et cetera to that, which clearly be an input to that as well . But clearly when you look at the abilities that you have to distribute cash there are only a handful of ways that you can utilize it. We\u2019ve given you CapEx number. That would be acquisitive in the near term on small basis. So then you\u2019re really talking about shareholder distribution, and the question is what the relative proportion now between dividends and buybacks. But it\u2019s an active conversation right now. Obviously Jim is our new CEO, its perspectives will be discussing those with the board and look forward to sharing those with you in March. Scott Group : Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citi Research. Your line is open. Chris Wetherbee : Hey. Thanks very much. I wanted to come back to your comments on pricing, Jim, specifically you discontinuing sort of the metric you\u2019ve given us, but maybe you can help us with some comparability to the previous quarters, how you saw pricing specifically in the fourth quarter and maybe a little bit of sort of how you\u2019re thinking about the outlook into 2018 particularly on the merchandise and intermodal side where there is some comparability versus truck. We\u2019re seeing that market tight. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as you sort of think out in the fourth quarter than you look out to 2018 with those revenue targets, how we should be thinking about sort of the price lever within that mix? Frank Lonegro : I don\u2019t know what \u2013 I have some idea what the guidance was given to you in the last in the third quarter in terms of price for merchandise. I believe that number was about 2.2% increase. Chris Wetherbee : Not much in enrolled was 2.2 in Q3. Frank Lonegro : Yes. So our price in merchandise, again in the fourth quarter was higher than that. So we continue to trend upward and trust me we continue to focus on price. The proper mix of volume in price, but clearly a focus on price and that\u2019s one of the thing probably that I\u2019m most proud of in my career was while the rates in the railroad industry and a cent per revenue per mile dropped every year after year after year starting with the deregulation in the 80s, it was what we did at the Canadian national that put a brakes on the continual decline in rate and started to move prices up. So I\u2019m a big advocate here and as we work so hard to improve the quality of the product that we have to get the sales team focus that what we\u2019re selling is a service not a commodity that we go after as much of a price increase as we possibly can under the restrictions in our existing contracts, that contracts might in place. So, in terms of guidance other then for me to tell you what we\u2019ve done, I\u2019m not going to get any more specific in that. And in terms of explaining on a quarter by quarter basis what our price was, we\u2019ll tell you the overall topline breakdown in terms of volume and volume and price to get to what the revenue stream is. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that context. Couple of weeks ago, few weeks ago there is a letter to the STB, I think kind of highlighted that from service perspective there\u2019s not to be a lot of meaning or really any meaningful changes kind of going forward you know, you just execute kind of on the plan that stands right now, essentially that suggest that Hunter got through essentially everything he wanted to get through and now it's kind of more of a just executing on the plan as you move into 2018. I guess if you could just maybe give us a little bit of color around that when you think about the various business, merchandise, intermodal maybe coal, is there really anything else left to do from your perspective? And if so, kind of how much and maybe how that could kind of progress out? Understanding we\u2019re going to get more color on this in March, just kind of get a sense on maybe that comment specifically? Thank you. James Foote : Well, in terms of the order of magnitude, deciding on one data shut down eight major hump yards across your network is pretty dramatic and disruptive and deciding to kind of blow up a thought-out strategy, hub-and-spoke intermodal network overnight, again, it was pretty disruptive and dramatic. I do not see us having anything like that. Luckily Ed and I have talked about that. Luckily we inherited a very hard that work in difficult decisions that Hunter made for us early, when he was here last year. I think we would have come to the same conclusion that those things needed to be done. I just don't think I would have decided that we\u2019re going to do all in one day on a Tuesday. And so we are the beneficiaries of that very, very difficult work that was done by him and the team here. That is not to say that what we have here is a walk in the park. We are going to continue to grind. Now comes the difficult part of getting this trains to continually to run at \u2013 I mean, we\u2019re already hitting both velocities now that are ever near record speeds in the history of CSX. So when I came here I think you have to go back to the steam engine passenger days to kind of figure out when you had train velocities that were all what we\u2019re at today. So the velocity of taking out intermediate stops is improving the deficiencies of the terminals, grinding out on these trip plans now in order to improve both the origin, the pickup at the customer location, deliver a delivery of the product and the car at the destination, driving train length, improving fuel efficiency, optimizing the use of distributed power, all these initiatives are what drives the cost down, improves the quality of the product. And at the end of the day in more simplistic terms is what you want to measure and what we\u2019re doing by or having lower operating ratios drives the operating ratio down. Day-in, day-out, seven day a week we work in process change and now that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. That\u2019s exactly what I brought in Ed Harris. Nobody is more of a bulldog when it comes to getting a hold of these initiatives and getting them done. So the organization spend three hours this morning with all of the vice presidents going through each and everyone of these initiatives and assigning accountability and responsibility not to get it done some time in the second week of June, but to come to me and Ed, in about 10 or 12 days with the plans and how we\u2019re going to implement everyone\u2019s initiative. So, again, Kevin has given me the \"Don't give the story away\" but in the 1st of March we\u2019ll have our transportation people there, our engineering people there, our mechanical people there to go through these strategies in detail and show you what we\u2019re doing to make, to bring home these initiatives, and most importantly get the results to the bottomline. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Russell of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matt Russell : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just first to start off on labor and that potential for additional headcount reductions, just want to make sure I understand that correctly. It sounds like you still see quite a bit of opportunity to take out labor costs on the existing volume base. Can you talk about how much of that is tied to management and consulting type labor and in any context around that? And how much is tied to just swing in volumes? Frank Lonegro : In terms of the breakdown between management and various different crafts, as I said we\u2019re grinding this up right now and it will be a little more detailed on that in about six weeks. So I just \u2013 that plan, again, that we\u2019re looking at -- we\u2019re looking at the attrition rates, the attrition by craft, that kind of thing, as well as how aggressive we can get on some of the consultants. So again, when that plan is complete by the New York Times we\u2019ll be able to give you some set of view on that. James Foote : But overtime, Matt, just to chime in all three categories of resource-based whether its management union or contractors and consultants, you should expect all of those to be lower overtime. Matt Russell : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just one follow-up on tax, in regards to the STB revenue adequacy determination, is there any potential change there with what's going on? Tax rate is coming down that would impede your ability to base rates, raise pricing? Have you thought through or having conversations there? James Foote : Yes. We\u2019re starting to take, look at that obviously the question around revenue adequacy in both specific to railroads and then across the industry it is through the cycle analysis rather than any particular year. And the other thing obviously that we always look at is whether if there\u2019s a placement cost not that the historical book value that was used also by the regulators determining what's revenue adequate to. Nothing in the near terms that causes new concern. Matt Russell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Ken Hoexter : Hey, Jim, tough as to why, but good luck to you Ed and Frank and moving forward, maybe you can talk a little about what has caught you off guard or things that are maybe a little different? And how things have changed at the rail, I don\u2019t know maybe it's technology more advance, PTC something you have to learn maybe kind of the learning steps for you Ed as you kind of get back in and start tackling the precision railroad model at a different rail? Edward Harris : Well, I\u2019ll you and that I\u2019ve never been drawn to be honest about it even when I retired from CN or moved on, I have consulted almost consistently helping global infrastructure partners by a railroad in Australia. We went after Seattle [ph] one time and then we ended up with Pacific national. Later then that I\u2019ve also consulted with the Rio Tinto in Australia as well as RUMO in Brazil, and quite frankly being part of the Chicago study group, the study group that was sponsored by six retired chief operating officers, Hunter was kind enough to put me on that committee. And we learned a lot about Chicago. Unfortunately the report which belongs to Brigadier, sits on a shelf somewhere in the AR headquarters like, yes, there are still a lot of good ideas there. So I can\u2019t say, I\u2019ve been surprised about anything operationally. I will tell you this. We have to take advantage of the technology that\u2019s out there. Jim mentioned the strategy of power and we\u2019re already starting our coal service more effectively with distributed power. I\u2019m also big component of run-through interchange, especially in a terminal like Chicago. I'd like to look in and I\u2019ve got the group looking into running directly back into the UP and BM and trying in all of our efforts to stay out f the belt, only because we\u2019re given up two days worth of cycle when we do that. And I certainly would like to avoid that. And I want to rule out use of short lines. I\u2019ve been Chairman of OmniTRAX board for the last four years and I\u2019ve also been on the board of the TRAX Maintenance Company up at Canada. Both positions resigned when Jim and the board were nice enough to give me an opportunity at this job again. And you know lot of people say, and well I will jus I\u2019m experienced and I\u2019m certainly really excited about opportunity. I\u2019m excited about the staff here at CSX. And I'm telling you this group is focused and will be even more so focused. I won\u2019t rule out the short lines for a short term route. I would rule out the use of partnering with our other Class 1 partner certain carriers just to take advantage of maybe an opportunity to do some directional running and/or running long trains and directionally with our network we\u2019ve got a lot of options, maybe too many options, but we\u2019ll look at that as well too. So, thanks for the question. And it\u2019s an honor to be part of Jim\u2019s team and certainly an honor to be back in the Class 1 fold again. James Foote : He hasn't missed a beat. He forgotten \u2013 he\u2019s forgotten in his \u2013 what do you call yourself? Golden age or whatever you are now. He's in the league of extraordinary gentlemen now. He\u2019s forgotten more of our railroad and the most guys ever knew. So, we\u2019re not in here at this role and his responsibility under some extremely difficult circumstances, the first person that I thought of that could come in here is to make sure that I was able to keep an eyes on the property to make sure we didn't skip keep a beat with Ed Harris. And so he's lived up to all expectations that team from the first day on the property on a conference call. He jumps in the middle of the call to start challenging people about why they're weighing chemical cars in the hump yard. And so it\u2019s great to have Ed here and he\u2019s doing a super job. Ken Hoexter : Great. Thanks for that both of you. Appreciate. And I guess just my follow-up would be any reason for on-time arrivals still down in the 50s while originations have stepped up? And I guess just as you think about that. And then I guess follow-on to that is, do you kind of follow-on with the Hunter camps and the whiteboard session in terms of working on the culture change at the company as you do that? Edward Harris : I would probably say, Ken, originations, you're right, we\u2019re doing very well there and really doing very well on the intermodal train side. I think in an effort to keep that business service-oriented closer on time the other trains may take a bit of a hit. It's wintertime, too, as well. This is a tough quarter to operate in. And the focus today will be as it is when I walk in the door is to reduce train starts, take some of that congestion out of the network, allow us to operate across the network on an on-time basis and Jim mentioned earlier seven days a week full filled trains I mean, from one end to other we want to fill the train out and certainly go with the tonnage. We got enough power, we've got more power than what we need right now and we\u2019ve already start to put the power this year in regard to it. It\u2019s not a power question at all. Its probably more weather-related than anything else. And the effort is on service and we\u2019ll always be on service where I come from. Frank Lonegro : Yes. Both the origin, when we change \u2013 we did the service that design plan for the network, we improved, again, train fluidity, train velocity from terminal to terminal. Going back at origin and destination terminals is where our challenges were which is not unexpected and we have done a great strives in improving train originations. Now, we need to get the final \u2013 the final piece of the puzzle are put together here and everybody is focused on that. Clearly I am not, and I don\u2019t think in this company is here with us and telling our customers we\u2019re running this schedule railroad that being on-time 50% is acceptable. That's not the goal. That's going to get fixed. I told the customers that\u2019s going to get fixed and it\u2019s going to get fixed as quickly as we can. Unfortunately we\u2019ve been hit by some pretty tough weather over the last couple of weeks, but we\u2019re all eyes are on the problem. Ken Hoexter : Great. Thanks for the answer. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good evening to everyone. And Jim and Frank, congrats on the new team here. I guess just wish it was under different circumstances, but life happens fast. We look forward to you guys carrying on Hunter\u2019s legacy here. I just want to follow-up on the revenue question Jim, about just looking out at the industrial landscape here it seems like core growth might even be accelerating in North America and obviously we haven\u2019t even seen what\u2019s going to happen with the likely cash infusion we\u2019ll see from tax reform. So is there is something about lingering, you know just with that discussion on your on-time arrivals, is there lingering service issues that just give you pause on the topline out for 2018? Or is it more strategic customer changes or a bigger focus on pricing of a volume. How do interpret that guidance? James Foote : I think no, there\u2019s nothing wrong. Clearly we need to continue to focus on improving the service product. Again short answer is when we have the serious service issues in the middle of the year, we lost the business. If you followed Carlos, you could see that we lost the business. And then later in the year when it came to intermodal we demarketed a significant portion of our business. So and then we had a measure a plant shutdown in Florida, fertilizer plant, that is short-haul but a lot of volume. We had some big significant moves industrial waste last year that we don\u2019t have this year. So, yes, I believe and I speak with the head of our merchandize business unit every day, because everybody is talking about we\u2019re going to have 4% GDP run rate for the next four years or whatever is we\u2019re talking about, why isn\u2019t the business growing. The underlying base business in our chemicals, in our paperboard is solid and stable. We need to dig our way out of some of these holes from the last eight, nine months. And again as I said earlier instrumentation of this business has an historically maybe again it was implementation of this plant is doing it the Hunter way, what disruptive because he was very aggressive in making the changes caused business to go elsewhere. My experience is and looking around and talking to other people that business comes back when we smooth things out and we are focused and working very, very hard to make the improvements in our service that just going to take a little time and then its going to take a little time for the people to trust it and come back. But we are seeing some of those customers that have returned already. Edward Harris : Brandon, one other thing just to remind everybody, we\u2019re about the cycle of the height of the net benchmark. We\u2019re probably closed to 100 bucks per ton below where we were in the first quarter of last year. So even though gets some mutual volumes you\u2019re going to move it up to lower RPU. So just keep that in mind as you think of things. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. Appreciate the feedback. It\u2019s been a long call. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Long of Stephens. Your line is open. Justin Long : Thanks and good afternoon. So I wanted to start with a question on CapEx. You gave the guidance for 1.6 billion in 2018. Is that a good annual run rate to think about going forward? I was just wondering if you could talk in more detail about what's driving the reduction relative to last year and the sustainability of those cuts? Frank Lonegro : Hi, Justin, on the CapEx, so remembering the 1.6 that Jim gave, you got about 200 million of positive train control as part of that what we call core CapEx is more in the 1.4 range, what\u2019s driving that reduction is a handful of pretty significant things obviously a bit of rolling stock holiday on both engines and freight cars for the foreseeable future. So I think that\u2019s sustainable. Then you look at sidings and technology and things of that nature that we\u2019re going to depend on how Jim looks at the railroad and how we unlock productivity going forward. So clearly the rolling stuff is going to hold. We\u2019re going to see a step down in positive train control from 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020. We\u2019ll give you a lot more color on this as we get into the Investor Day, but at a high level I think you could probably figure out we\u2019re headed. Justin Long : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe as a quick follow-up on PTC, could you share your latest plans as it relates to the timing of that rollout and I\u2019m also curious what you\u2019re expecting for the PTC operating cost this year and how that compares to what you saw last year? Frank Lonegro : Sure. So on where we are. We are at about half of the PTC footprint is operational. We will hit the compliance milestone at the end of 2018 which is that we\u2019ll be hardware-compliant and over half of the subdivisions that are requiring PTC will be implemented. So we\u2019re on-track to do that. And then we will be on-track to hit the final milestones in 2020. Your OpEx question, obviously the OpEx has been ramping up since we started the project in 2008 in 2017 within our results there\u2019s about 150 million of operating expenses part of our results. Ultimately that could ramp up somewhere in the $200 million to $250 million range in say, 2020, 2021 or 2022 as the things roll off warranty etcetera. And remember there\u2019s a big split there between what is cash and what\u2019s non-cash. About two-thirds of the numbers have given you our own depreciation line and then rest are generally on the MS&O. Justin Long : Okay, great. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks so much for the time. Operator : Our next question comes from David Vernon of Stanford Bernstein. Your line is open. David Vernon : Hey, good afternoon guys and thanks for taking the questions. Frank, I want to ask the CapEx question in a slightly different way. Two years you signed off a budget at about 2.7 billion, this year\u2019s 2 billion next year\u2019s 1.6 billion. How do you get comfortable communicating to the board that we\u2019re not spending below sort of renewal CapEx, I mean, this is a pretty aggressive cut in the capital budget on a 40-year asset. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for where you think maintenance CapEx levels are in the railroad and how do you get comfortable you\u2019re not getting below that level? Frank Lonegro : Yes. I think good question. And I\u2019d like to open in paragraph for your note to put up. But anyway, how do we comfortable with it? It\u2019s because we\u2019re cutting in the right places and not cutting in the wrong places. When we look at what we\u2019re doing from the number of track miles of new rail, the amount of balance that we\u2019re putting down, the number of ties that we\u2019re putting down, the number of bridges that we\u2019re working through, I mean, all that in the core CapEx is largely we\u2019re saying that it has been $2.7 billion budget. Remember when you look at the $2.7 billion budget about 600 million of that was engine. We also had a $2 million of freight cars in there. We had a big siding budget and the big technology budget as part of that. So when you look at where we\u2019re going to be in the next few again, the rolling stock, I don\u2019t its needing to invest any significant amount of money. Now we may expect money disturbed of power and things like that, but we\u2019re not going to spend money on new engines for new freight cars in the near term. We have over 20,000 freight cars in storage and we\u2019ve had 850 engines [Indiscernible] scrap. Edward Harris : Almost over 900. James Foote : 900 locomotives serviceable, usable, ready to go locomotives and we're already putting 100 \u2013 we put a 133 that includes the 133 that we\u2019re going to put in this year as we include -- improved fluidity. I do not envision us needing to spend any significant money in the next few years at least in the foreseeable future as far as I\u2019m concern on things like expanding intermodal terminals and doing things like that. We can improve the productivity in all of our facilities to the point where they should be functional as the way they see in today. And it\u2019s actually free up facilities for maybe use for other purposes, and if we can find other use form, they are for sale. So in terms of the -- you look at kind of the last five-year run rate in terms of rail, in terms of turnouts, in terms of turn rail, in terms of size installed, in terms of balance, we are spending the same amount of money that\u2019s historically been spent by CSX to make sure they are safe and reliable network. When Hunter came in he had many engineering firms come in as anyone would do and the reason I know that was my second day on the job, I went to the engineering department, that\u2019s a first thing you want to know, what kind of railroad we\u2019ve got and this is a very, very well maintained, not gold plated physical plant. And we intend to spend the same amount of money and keep his plant in excellent working shape in the foreseeable future and \u2013 but we don\u2019t need to spent money on the things that have been spend in the past and won\u2019t do that unless there's some huge compelling reason for us to do that. Edward Harris : But right now, my only think to add to that is, if I see any capital spend and maybe in some siding extensions that would be \u2013 but quite frankly our average train length is less than our siding length as it is today, we still need to be pushing train length, train capacity and then we start watching delays if we get into that. James Foote : And if we need to extend that we\u2019ll do it smart and we\u2019ll use rail from other locations to rely that, to use rail in other location. So we\u2019ll do it smart, but we\u2019re not in any way shape or form not keeping this railroad in a fantastic condition. David Vernon : And just maybe as a quick follow-up, do you feel comfortable that that the network as it\u2019s been invested did they could handle the longer trains and running a little bit faster? Or do you think there\u2019s a risk that you might see some CapEx creep back into the outlook a year or two down the road? James Foote : We\u2019re not planning on doing anything in terms of train length and distributed power that hasn\u2019t been done on another railroad for a decade. So this is just a question of implementing strategies that have been tried and proven effectively across North America and clearly we have the physical plants in the assets to be able to do it. David Vernon : Alright. Thanks for the time. Operator : The next question comes from Fadi Chamoun of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Fadi Chamoun : Yes. Good evening and thanks for taking my question. Jim, I just wanted to kind of circle back on the culture a little and what\u2019s going on with CSX. A number of the former CSX leaders have left and now the leadership transition to you and you brought on a very capable operator and that Harris and that's all great. Just wonder if can talk a little bit about the morale of the rank-and-file, do feel that you are supported? Do you feel that the vision that you've laid out -- that Hunter laid out and you are continuing on with precision railroading regarding is kind of supported across the organization? James Foote : Yes. My belief and I said this from the very beginning, extremely impressed just Ed said, it\u2019s been here a week not even and as Ed said, the people here are very impressive. These are great railroaders. They are hard workers. And they want to do a good job. They just -- they\u2019re looking for a little guidance and they want to be a success. Everybody in the life wants to be a success. And this model \u2013 the scheduled railroad model is the way to turn CSX around and make it as I keep telling everyone that the best railroad in North America. So, I have a high degree of confidence that the people here are bought in to what is we\u2019re trying to accomplish. You got to understand it wasn\u2019t that long ago. There was a lot of kiosk going on and as I said with a lot of changes that were being made in for Hunter has done what he did in the past eight months, what we did at CN in about three years, I can only imagine the pace of change and how chaotic that was for the team here. Since that point of time everybody has been focussed on what it is that needs to be accomplished, unfortunately under the circumstances I have not had enough time to get out into the field but Ed\u2019s going to go out in the field, I have plans already in place for me to get up and basically visit every location on the railroad and meet with every management personnel on the company and talk to them and tell them and make sure t hey understand what it is we are trying to accomplish and including the feedback that I\u2019ve gotten from the unsolicited emails from just some of the boys all over the network is that they wanted and let me know that they support me and they are welcoming me to the company, whether it\u2019s mechanical people in Pennsylvania to just people and they are always here in the headquarters office. So I\u2019m confident that we are going to be able to get up and Ed and I are going to be able to get out with the rest of the people, the management team and talk to people over the summer. Fadi Chamoun : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ravi Shankar of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ravi Shankar : Thanks guys, just a couple of follow ups here. Sorry if I missed this earlier but did you give your expectations of cost inflation and productivity gains target for 2018? Frank Lonegro : Hey Rob, it\u2019s Frank. No, we did not. You should expect significant efficiency gains obviously we\u2019ve been in connection with the revenue guidance that Jim gave and the OR expansion guidance that he gave. In terms of inflation you ought to see a pretty significant reduction and inflation year-over-year, obviously we got a real big inflation here in 2017 and if you see that step down quite nicely in 2018 the help and welfare above you that was up there in 2017 you know we sort of gotten full value in the health care trust and [Indiscernible] back to the fully funded to kind of that catch up like we did in 2017. So we ought to be in better shape in terms of the inflation going forward in 2017 or 2018, but we did not get specific dollar guidance. Ravi Shankar : Got it. So in 2017 you said that you would do your record year of productivity, will you do another record year in 2018? Frank Lonegro : [Indiscernible] Ravi Shankar : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International. Your line is open. Bascome Majors : Thanks for taking my question. For Jim or Frank, can you help us with how middle management is intensified to deliver the financial outcomes and investors are expecting from you guys. And how if at all that has changed since Hunter joined almost a year ago? James Foote : The incentives in terms of annual cash bonus for management and actually get some unions on it as well are 100% aligned with the types of targets we\u2019ve set in the past and the types of targets that were set in the future specifically operating income and operating ratios. And then as we go forward for multiyear incentives those will be operating income and free cash flow. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much, good afternoon everyone. Frank, you talked about inflation, how it was going to step down. Are you indicating that your overall costs or rail inflation is expected to go negative or just step down from the higher rates that? Frank Lonegro : Less of a hurdle. Walter Spracklin : Less of a hurdle, okay. Makes sense, okay. And so on that basis I know Jim you are not guiding on price but is there any reason why you wouldn\u2019t be able to continue to exceed the inflation, the real inflation that you are seeing in the market wise with your pricing? James Foote : Well I think as I told you before, I think that the \u2013 again what I said about the prices earlier in terms of merchandise what they were and what they were in the quarter you know not \u2013 I can\u2019t really talk about future prices but as you know if you kind of look at what we\u2019ve done and then you don\u2019t make your own assessment as if you know look well that will be next year and the year after. Frank Lonegro : Bascom\u2019s question, one second, on the multi-year trajectory and the incentives, its operating ratio and free cash flow not operating income of free cash flow on the one year incentives it is operating income and operating ratio. Walter Spracklin : On the volume side then if we look at your price mix and volume as your component to your revenue up slightly, if we make the assumption that your pricing is going to exceed inflation it would suggest that your part \u2013 your volume will be negative for next year, if that\u2019s the wrong read let me know but is there \u2013 is this just a function of some of the what you mentioned about the prior volatility in some of your end markets with regards to coal or other or am I you know are we not to take that view of negative volume and a negative volume environment and perhaps associate it with mix? Frank Lonegro : So yes, that\u2019s a good and fairly complicated question given the moving parts. Remember, a couple of things. Jim mentioned what we are doing on the intermodal side and what we\u2019ve done in 2017 that\u2019s got to cycle through from a volume perspective. Now we did have some plant closures and project completions and things that Jim mentioned, so those have to roll through. Even if you look at export coal and say its volume neutral and you do have a fairly significant step down in the benchmarks, so you have to have all of those things as part of your equation. When you look at merchant intermodal there is going to be obviously one level of pricing that we are assuming that when you cycle a big RPU difference in the export coal your headline may not be impressive but you know that\u2019s far over what we are dealing within 2018. And then if you obviously should -- to Scott's earlier question, should be up next year given what the price of fuel is. Walter Spracklin : Okay. And last question just generally kind of on guidance in general, I mean you\u2019ve obviously in the past been quite transparent and very good with providing that guidance and I\u2019ve just noticed a lot of repeated questions here as we try to understand some of what you are seeing in terms of your outlook here. Are we just in this kind of interim period before your March investor day and are we going to move back towards or a little bit more of clarity with regards to what your 2000 or your next year guidance is or is this kind of more of demonstrative of the new norm in terms of what disclosure you have been providing on a go-forward basis? Frank Lonegro : Specifically as it just relates to price? Walter Spracklin : No, your volume outlooks used to delineate on a kind of category by category basis. You gave tonnage with regards to export coal, your earnings guidance was kind of intermodal explicit range... Frank Lonegro : Again, yes, in terms of price as I said earlier, I mean this is the kind of discussion that I\u2019ve historically done in other lives in the industry. So, this is probably the new norm in terms of just price discussion. In terms of everything else I expect that we will continue to be as transparent as the company has been in the past and I think yes, your conclusion that are we hedging until we get to the investor meeting is accurate. We\u2019ll be a little more forthcoming on some of these topics in New York and again we have \u2013 be in a position there to answer the questions at that time. Walter Spracklin : Okay, that\u2019s fantastic. Looking forward to it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Jason Seidl : Thank you operator. Hey gentlemen, thanks for taking the question. Quickly, can you talk a little bit about the cadence of the volume expectations for next year? Do you expect to get some of that business that you guys lost in 2017 back as your service levels improve? Frank Lonegro : You know again yes, some of it might not come back so we might not want back, and some of it is already beginning to return. So it\u2019s going to be kind of a mix bag if you assume that when a company makes a decision to go to a different transportation service provider they are probably going to do it for a couple of weeks, mainly they commit for a year. And so as we look our way through this issue, if you assume that the service problems began last year around June, July that\u2019s probably when we saw some of the business begin to move away and so I would \u2013 I am optimistic and we are working with our sales team to have a very good understanding there \u2013 if I need to go and talk to the customers there and if we change things and things were better. I've told the sales guys \u2013 and they can do that. I know they are willing to do that. I know they are willing to out and meet the customers, I have already met with a lot of customers, they want assurances that you know scheduled railroad does not mean disruption and we are able to explain that and how they want to say show me. And as we\u2019ve said throughout the call today, their number one goal right now is to show them and I believe and history repeats itself towards the experience has been fast and we show people that we are better and we are substantially better than we were and substantially better than the competition that the business will begin to come back. But it\u2019s not something we can just flip a switch on, in some cases you\u2019ve got to win back across to the customer and that\u2019s the plan going into 2018. And just I mean you know that the comps are harder in the first quarter. Jason Seidl : It sounds like you guys will at least get a chance to win back that \u2013 you have a few months to win back that confidence here before some of these maybe your long commitments renew. Follow up question real quick, you guys got back into the Baltimore tunnel project after getting out of it, just wondering the thought process by now. James Foote : No, my commitment was you know again there was a lot of dialogue with the city, the state, the federal representatives, the ports and literally I mean I was out of job about two and a half weeks and with years [ph] to go and in the U.S. Senate building and discuss the Baltimore tunnel project with those people and what I told them was that we would \u2013 Hunter had said no, we are not taking federal money to double stack this tunnel, we don\u2019t need it. And that we don\u2019t need the double stack tunnel. And what I told the individuals that I met with was I would undertake to take in my own look at this project and run the numbers again in terms of where we saw growth where if we needed to double stack the tunnel and also look at whether or not there are alternatives to double stacking the tunnel that meets the needs of the growing port, meet the needs of our customers and meet the needs of the government officials in terms of moving the public works projects forward. And we are in the process of both working our way through that, have not reached a conclusion. When we reach a conclusion I will go back personally and I will go back and meet with those groups and tell them what our decision is. But we haven\u2019t completed the work yet to be able to do that. Jason Seidl : Oh, that\u2019s good color. I appreciate the time as always gentlemen. James Foote : Thank you very much. Kevin Boone : Operator that ends the call. James Foote : Thank you so much everyone. Look forward to seeing you in New York in about I guess six weeks or whatever it is and again having a great dialogue with you at that time. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. And you may disconnect your lines.",

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks and introduction, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Boone, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Michelle, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call is Jim Foote, Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Lonegro, Chief Financial Officer. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3.  With that, it is my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. James Foote : Thank you very much, Kevin. It's great to be here this afternoon with everybody on the call. Before we start with the slides, I would like to make a few comments. CSX had a very good quarter. We are drastically changing the way we operate the railroad by taking millions of unnecessary steps out of the business process that we use to run the railroad. This is producing record operating performance, improved customer service and, when combined, impressive returns to shareholders. The women and men of CSX have accomplished a lot. Clearly, first quarter results are a reflection of all the hard work that has taken place over the past year. We are proud of these results, and I would like to thank all CSX employees for their contributions towards achieving them.  With that said, the plan recently laid out at our investor conference is a 3-year plan. We're only 1 quarter in, 1 out of 12, and we still have a lot of work to do to achieve our goals. The good news is that every day I feel a little more confident in our ability to deliver on these targets. And I want to take the time to highlight safety. On my watch, safety will always come first. We have some work to do to improve, and the team is committed to do so. To be the best run railroad, you have to be the safest. Now let's get into the deck, and we'll start with the Slide 5 on our highlights. And this should be a pretty simple quarter to walk through. We only had 1 extra day in last year's first quarter and, other than the restructuring charge last year, just a few relatively minor onetime events that Frank and I will point out. EPS increased 53% to $0.78 versus last year's adjusted EPS of $0.51. The increase was driven by lower costs on flat revenues, which drove a 19% improvement in operating income versus the prior year's adjusted results. The new lower cash rate and share count, down about 4%, also contributed to the significant year-over-year increase. Our operating ratio improved 570 basis points to 63.7% when compared to last year's adjusted OR of 69.4%, a record first quarter. I might be a little biased, but I think it's CSX's best quarter ever. Lower cost in labor and MS&O partially offset by price, driven fuel -- higher fuel costs, drove a significant year-over-year improvement.  Going to the next slide, Slide 6. Total revenue was flat as price, fuel surcharge and supplemental revenues offset a 4% decline in volume and negative mix. We did see a slight sequential improvement in pricing, excluding coal. Looking at the business segment. Each was, to some degree, impacted by either outside influences or a prior period demarcating decision. Chemicals was impacted by a few items, including no fly ash movements that occurred last year, lower plastic and pet coke shipments and basically no crude-by-rail. Lower North American vehicle production and challenges with rail car availability, which was an industry issue, reduced auto. Ag and food was mainly impacted by lower ethanol business, which we exited because of its low or no margin. And fertilizer revenues, as I mentioned previously, were down due to the Plant City facility closure. Domestic utility coal declines were somewhat offset by a continuing strong export coal market. And intermodal saw strong international volumes. Other revenues increased year-over-year as liquidated damages contributed $19 million, and the remaining increase was driven by higher demurrage and other supplemental revenue. Obviously, we have changed the business practices in this area and are working with our customers to create a more fluid network.  On Slide 7, let's take a quick look at our operating performance. We've highlighted some key metrics that are familiar with you. As we outlined at the Investor Day, we continue to make significant progress year-over-year in both train velocity and car dwell. We also saw improvement in train length and GTMs per available horsepower, which represent improved asset utilization and efficiency. It seems like almost every day, we set a new CSX record in one area of our operations or another. We are making progress, but there is clearly more opportunity ahead. Since the beginning of the year, we reduced another 142 locomotives and a total of 816 year-over-year. Service design improvements have been -- have seen a reduction in over 40.8 million expected annual car miles and 351 weekly crude starts year-to-date. Brian Barr in our mechanical department has done an exceptional job with line of road failures, improving 35% and doing it with a smaller workforce.  Now let me hand it over to Frank, who will take you through the financials and provide more details on the benefits from the operational improvements. Frank Lonegro : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 9. Let me walk you through the summary income statement. Reported revenue was roughly flat for the first quarter as a 4% decline in volume was offset by the benefits of increased supplemental revenue, higher fuel surcharge recoveries and solid core pricing gains.  Moving to expenses. The P&L reflects our adoption of the new pension accounting standards where only the service cost component of our pension expense is now included in operating expense, while the remaining aspects of pension accounting now fall below the line in other income. Prior year results, including the geography of last year's restructuring charge, have been restated to reflect this new standard. Total operating expenses were 13% lower in the first quarter, 8% lower after normalizing for last year's restructuring charge. Overall, labor and fringe savings of $100 million or 12% year-over-year were driven by an 11% reduction in average headcount.  Scheduled railroading enabled train crew savings on multiple fronts. A 22% increase in velocity and a 5% increase in train length enable an 8% reduction in road crew starts, while the elimination of 8 hump yards last year and a 20% improvement in cars processed per man hour drove savings in yards staffing levels. Improved network fluidity seen through the velocity and dwell metrics, combined with a 20% improvement in GTMs per available horsepower, has helped eliminate rolling stock assets. Our active locomotive fleet was down 23%, and the number of cars on line came down by 11%, the combination of which enabled resource reductions within our mechanical workforce. In addition, the efforts we started in early 2017 with our management restructuring to streamline the management workforce, eliminate bureaucracy and improve the speed of decision-making across the system and here in Jacksonville have resulted in significantly lower labor expense. Fewer management resources also resulted in lower incentive compensation expense versus the prior year quarter. MS&O expense was down 16% against the prior year. The asset efficiency of scheduled railroading, combined with improved year-over-year locomotive availability, resulted in lower fleet counts, yielding lower materials expense, lower maintenance and repair costs and lower levels of consumables. Given the sustainable nature of these asset reductions, we have sold or scrapped hundreds of engines and thousands of freight cars in the past 12 months. The locomotive fleet reductions have also allowed us to rightsize our contracted maintenance services agreement. Fewer crew starts and the more balanced network operating plan also drove reductions in ancillary costs such as hotels, meals and taxis. Efforts to streamline the workforce and reduce organizational complexity also apply to our contractor and consultant workforce. Working towards our broader total workforce targets for 2018 and beyond, we have made significant progress in reducing our labor footprint with savings from contractor and consultant reductions flowing to the MS&O line.  Finally, continued efforts to monetize our surplus real estate portfolio resulted in $32 million of real estate gains in the quarter versus $2 million in the year-ago period. The gains in this year's first quarter are consistent with the guidance we provided at the investor conference, that we would achieve $300 million of cumulative real estate sales through 2020.  Looking at the other expense items. Depreciation increased slightly due to changes in the asset base driven by capital investments, offset by asset sales. 24% higher fuel prices year-over-year presented a significant headwind, although our continued focus on fuel efficiency through better matching a horsepower to trailing tonnage and increased use of energy management and distributed power technologies drove year-over-year improvement in fuel efficiency despite harsher winter conditions this year.  The equipment rents are up slightly due to higher incidental rents, though we are continuing to drive days per load improvements to reduce our car hire expense. Equity earnings were favorable primarily due to improved performance at our affiliates and tax reform true-ups.  Lastly, we are cycling 2017's restructuring charges, part of which are now housed below the line due to the new pension accounting standard. Below the line, interest expense increased, primarily due to the additional debt we issued earlier this year. Tax expense was roughly flat on a 57% increase in pretax earnings, illustrating the favorable impacts of tax reform. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.8%, though we continue to expect around 25% for the full year. All told, these pieces sum to the headline items Jim highlighted in his opening remarks. Importantly, the 63.7% operating ratio we achieved in the first quarter represents a meaningful step toward the 60% operating ratio target we set at last month's investor conference.  Turning to the cash side of the equation on Slide 10. Capital investments in the first quarter reflect our recently announced 3-year capital target of $4.8 billion, driven by the reduced capital intensity of the scheduled railroading model. As we've said many times before and reiterate here, our commitment to investing in safety and reliability remains unwavering, and we have undoubtedly become a less capital-intensive company through improved asset utilization that reduces yard infrastructure and rolling stock needs and better processes that serve as an effective alternative to capital investments. Our free cash flow growth of 3% was more muted than our earnings growth would have implied. First and most importantly, estimated federal tax payments for the first quarter are not paid until April. As a result, you see the year-over-year benefits of tax reform in our earnings but not yet in our free cash flow. Second, as with any quarter, there are timing items that can impact free cash flow on a short-term basis. Here, we made back wage payments in the quarter to employees affiliated with unions that have concluded national bargaining. There were also timing differences in state tax payments and prepaid expenses. Bigger picture, the combination of core earnings growth, lower CapEx and lower cash taxes will drive significant free cash flow conversion and $8.5 billion of cumulative free cash flow through 2020.  Finally, we were pleased to provide significant returns to our shareholders during the first quarter. On February 12, we announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend and meaningfully increased our share buyback program to $5 billion, with expected completion in the first quarter of 2019. As you evaluate our buyback cadence in the quarter, remember that our buybacks in the first half of the quarter were premised on a much smaller $1.5 billion program. Since implementing a larger program mid-quarter, we have capitalized on recent mark-to-market fluctuations and repurchased shares at a faster than pro rata pace.  With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. James Foote : Great. Thanks a lot, Frank. As I said at the very beginning, it's a very simple and clean quarter for everyone to understand. And so in conclusion on the last slide here, a little bit about the financial outlook. As I've said before, previously said, we expect the revenue to be up slightly for the year, and I have the increased confidence in this outlook given the start of the year.  Also, as many of you are aware, as I am happy to say, not only to say it, but I am happy that we are no longer under the requirement to have weekly calls with the STB. We have improved our service, and I expect that to continue. As we demonstrated in the first quarter, we expect a solid step-down each year in the operating ratio. There remains significant work ahead in order to deliver on our 2020 target of a 60% OR. However, our goal of making CSX the best run railroad is in sight, and we are working hard to achieve that.  So I would like to turn it back to Kevin now. We can start. Frank and I will be glad to answer any of your questions. Kevin Boone : Okay. [Operator Instructions]. Michelle, I think we're ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Christian Wetherbee : I guess, maybe I want to start on the revenue side. So, Jim, you kind of outlined the outlook for some modest revenue growth over the course of the year. I guess, when you think about sort of volume and price, could give us a little bit of sort of help there? When you looked at yields in 1Q, they certainly were good. Can you give us a sense of maybe where core pricing is and maybe what that assumption is of mix of volume and price as the year progresses? James Foote : Yes, I think what I said was prices sequentially improved slightly. If you exclude coal and if you look at the revenue, clearly, we are going to continue to see a slight tick-up as we go through the year in our supplemental revenues as we've implemented more specific demurrage policies as an example, and you'll see that in other. Fuel surcharge is going to move up and down as the year moves around. So I think there's a reasonable -- a reasonably solid environment out there for pricing. And based upon kind of expectation that we've put out there in terms of a year-over-year kind of slight increase, the run rate you're seeing there today in terms of volume and these other elements that increase or bringing together total revenue should be reasonably consistent with what you saw here as our -- and then as you remember, we've had a lot of onetime items in the prior year that we've demarcated. As an example, the 7% volume of intermodal that was taken off to railroad in late summer of last year as well as some other items. And those items, we begin to cycle. And so that's why we're a little more confident that the volume in the later part of the year begins to see more of an improvement than what we're having right now. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. So cadence could get a bit better as the year progresses. That's helpful. And then just maybe a follow-up on... James Foote : But a much shorter way of saying it, yes. Christian Wetherbee : Yes. I appreciate it. Now your color was greatly appreciated. And then, I guess, just trying to get a sense of what maybe normal seasonality from an operating ratio perspective might look like. So you guys are doing some dramatic things on the cost side, so it's a little hard to kind of see through that and relate it back to your historical patterns from 1Q and then how the rest of the year typically plays out. Is there anything you can help us with and maybe, Frank, sort of headcount expectations? We saw where you ended the quarter. But anything you do on sort of the cost or cadence of the OR improvement in 2018 would be helpful. James Foote : Clearly, the first quarter, so I think in everybody's opinion here, the first quarter is the toughest operating environment for CSX. And I'll let Frank jump in if he has anything additional to that. Frank Lonegro : Chris, the only thing I'd add, as you implied seasonality for the rest of the year, remember that we had a couple of fairly significant onetime items in the second quarter, so you probably need to adjust a little bit for that one. On the headcount side, I mean, you see the 3,000 year-over-year in the first quarter, and it really doesn't matter whether you look at average headcount or ending headcount, we're down about 3,000 employees year-over-year. When you add in contractors, it's a little bit more than that on a year-to-date basis, about 1,100 down year-to-date, and that's against the goal that Jim set on the fourth quarter call of around 2,000. So we feel like we're in pretty good shape on that one. So hopefully, that gives you enough color to go on. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kenneth Hoexter : Jim, your thoughts on the service failures of some of your peer railroads. Does that impact your ability to continue this pace of improvement just given the amount of traffic that is interchanged between rails, whether it's your fellow eastern peer or even going west or north? Can you just talk about your -- the constraints that you see from that? James Foote : Well, Ken, clearly, it's a network out there, and so we're impacted, to a degree, by our interchange partners, whether they be in the west at Chicago or Memphis or wherever or the Canadians, again, in Chicago or wherever we interchange traffic. So obviously, we would like to have a more fluid network. It's better for us. But I think if you look at our operating performance in the first quarter and if you look at the way we ran our network during the first quarter, if you wanted any proof that the scheduled railroad model works, you'd want to stress it. So I think we passed the stress test in terms of -- Hunter didn't build a dome over this railroad. We are operating in the same winter conditions as everyone else and in the same soup, so to speak, with everyone else, and we improved dramatically. And so I think that's kind of a -- shows the resiliency and the strength of our organization to perform even better in the future just based upon historical operating performance metrics. Kenneth Hoexter : Yes. Truly a great job. Just didn't know if there was a limitation based on what you saw, but great job. The follow-up would just be on the sustainability of your other revenue surcharges. Does business adapt now that they see that you're increasing your rates on demurrage and other items? Or does that come back down as your customers adapt? Or do you expect that to continue to grow as you've changed the business based on what you've seen in the past? Frank Lonegro : Ken, it's Frank. So we broke out for you the liquidated damages piece in the prepared remarks. So you've got that as an item, obviously, to look at on a onetime basis in the quarter. We're not trying to make tons of money on supplemental revenue. We're really trying to change the behavior of the customers so that we get into 7-day a week service, we get into balance, we get into the things that scheduled railroading is all about. And in some respects, we need the customers' help in turning cars fasters. So this is really intended to be a behavior change or -- I wouldn't imply the run rate that you saw here in the first quarter for the rest of the year. Think something more like the 1.15 type of a number for Qs 2, 3 and 4. And obviously, we're expecting the customers to change their behavior and not want to pay these charges going forward. But Jim's commentary on the top line should give you a sense of where we think we're going to be on a volume basis. So we feel pretty good about it. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Thomas Wadewitz : Congratulations on the great results, really strong OR and cost side performance. Wanted to, I guess, get your thoughts, kind of a granular one and then maybe a broader question. The comp and benefits per worker we were thinking maybe be up year-over-year was down, and, I guess, incentive comp was down. Can you help us think about, is that against the backdrop where performance is good? Is incentive comp going to be down in coming quarters? Or was that kind of a one-off? And how do we think about comp per worker as we look at second quarter, third quarter? Does that continue to be down? Or how would we think about that relative to first quarter? Frank Lonegro : Got you. Tom, Frank. You're right, on a comp per person basis in the quarter, we were better by about 1%. And you're right, the driver is largely the year-over-year favorability on incentive comp, probably a tad of employee mix in there as well. As you think about modeling in the future, if you assume static employee mix, you're really just talking about inflation and then you're spreading your fixed costs. I think what you're going to see on the incident comp piece depends on how we do against our plan as the year goes on. We did have a fairly significant headcount reduction year-over-year that drove it lower in the first quarter. And then as you think about the fourth quarter, remember, we had a fairly significant reversal of incentive comp in the fourth quarter of last year that we'll cycle. That was the reversal of Hunter's options, if you remember, about $30 million number. So just as you think through how to model that, those are probably the big moving parts. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay. So incentive comp might be down, but then you get to fourth quarter, it's tougher comp, it could be up. Is that... Frank Lonegro : I think that's fair, yes. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay. So then the broader question I have, I think you were asked this a little bit earlier, but with the 63.7% OR in first quarter, if you just apply kind of normal seasonality, you could be -- you could see 300 and 400 basis points of improvement in second and third quarters versus that. So that puts you at a 60%, 61% potentially second quarter, third quarter. Is that a reasonable framework that, that's possible you deliver that? Or should we kind of step back from that and there are one-offs in first quarter, whatever reason that, that type of pattern wouldn't apply? James Foote : Tom, as I said, we delivered a very, very solid and impressive performance in our historically most difficult period. But as I said many times in my opening remarks, this ain't easy. So we're going to continue to grind and we're going to continue to do everything we can to continue to improve. But 1 quarter out of 12 isn't a game done -- game set match. And so you figure it out. But we got -- this is hard work, and we're going to hopefully -- hopefully, we're going to get better. But I wouldn't draw any kind of drastic conclusions from the enormous step-down we just had in 1 quarter. Frank Lonegro : Yes. One other thing, Tom, just as you think about your year-over-year comparisons. Q1 of last year was pre-precision railroading. So you are not necessarily comparing apples-to-apples. Whereas, I think, as you go forward in this year, obviously, we made significant step-downs in Qs 2, 3 and 4 year-over-year against '16. So just sort of put that into the hopper as well. Operator : Allison Landry from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Allison Landry : Given the tightness in truckload and the service issues at Norfolk, do you think that your intermodal volumes could recover a lot sooner than you originally expected and I think is consistent with your comments at the Analyst Day? But how should we think about perhaps the cadence for the balance of the year and maybe what the potential upside is? James Foote : Yes. Intermodal this year, like I said though, has a big hole to climb out of, to a degree, but as we move forward, I think that -- clearly, there is a lot of opportunity for us on the intermodal side, both internationally and domestically. But we have two specific goals in mind as we look forward for intermodal, which I think we outlined at the investor conference, is, one, to make sure we improve the overall efficiency of the network and concentrate in the key corridors that are best for us; and then secondly, focus on the profitability of the business. And so just because there might be a lot of intermodal and truck business that's available in the marketplace right now, I'm not going out and just chasing it to put volume on the railroad. So we're going to logically and methodically move forward with the rollout of our growth plan. And so therefore, I'm not looking for a major, major upside in what we've already told you. Operator : Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Scott Group : So wanted to start on coal. Maybe if you can share some views there. Met prices kind of dipped a little bit below 200. And how you think about export volumes and maybe coal yields on a sequential basis given some of the step-down in met prices. And then maybe just some views on utility coal volumes that were down a bunch in first and how you're thinking about that rest of the year. James Foote : Yes. Let's take the second part of your question first, utility coal volumes. You know what the challenges are there in terms of the southern utilities here and the other ones that are most -- becoming more vulnerable. Northern utilities were stressed a few years ago, domestic utility coal volumes. And now it's kind of moving into the south. And so as gas prices stay low, we're going to try to do everything we can to keep those utilities up and operating, but it's a challenge for us. And so we're expecting that the domestic utility side of the business is going to remain under pressure, absent some other forces that would change that. On the export side, the -- both the thermal and met coals have remained relatively strong, stronger than we had originally expected. And the outlook for this year is that, that strength should continue. And we're not seeing -- even though some of the metrics that are used to price the business, like the API2, are starting to trend down slightly. The demand is still there. So we'll continue to do everything we can to maintain the domestic utility franchise, and we'll continue to run the wheels off the railcars to move as much of this export coal, whether it be thermal or met, as we possibly can as long as the demand is there. Scott Group : That's helpful. Jim, can you just say, do you have a big length-of-haul difference to southern versus northern utilities? James Foote : I think we do, yes. Scott Group : Longer than the south. James Foote : Yes, yes. That's why it's -- I guess, one's the south and one's the north. And the mines are more located in the north, so we run it further. Scott Group : Okay. And then, Frank, just quickly, can you just clarify what your point was about the buyback? And I know you didn't have the new bigger buyback until sort of the middle of the quarter. What's sort of quarterly run rate should we be thinking about for dollars on the buyback? Frank Lonegro : Well, it depends on what the stock price is, to be honest with you. But, no, we're obviously in the market pretty heavily, about $835-or-so million in the first quarter. The point I was trying to make was, if you were looking for a straight pro rata version of the $5 billion over 5 quarters, given the fact that we entered the program mid-quarter, we didn't obviously hit that. But from a run rate perspective, if you had forgiven the first 6 weeks, which were under the earlier program, we were ahead of a pro rata from that level. And obviously, it's going to depend on our prognosis for our performance for the year. It's going to depend on what we think the economy is going to do. And it's going to depend on what the market's reaction to our performance is. We're clearly going to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders over the coming four quarters. We've dimensionalized that for you. The exact cadence, I think, is just going to depend on the factors that I mentioned. Operator : Our next question comes from Fadi Chamoun from BMO Capital Markets. Fadi Chamoun : I just want to go back to the volume kind of questions. So you've kind of outlined at the Investor Day to us that, ultimately, the improved cost, improved service, your ability to kind of start leveraging that to grow the business faster is more of a 2019, 2020 story. But I'm wondering, given some of the service issues we're seeing elsewhere and the trucking capacity problem, is there kind of an opportunity here to see an acceleration? How's kind of the conversation with customers going? How do you feel about your ability to begin to leverage this service and cost story a little bit earlier? James Foote : It was only like six weeks ago, or whatever it was, we were in New York and kind of laid out this plan, and the weather conditions across North America were brutal at that time and the railroads, to a large degree, were having issues at that point in time. And everybody in the world knew about ELDs and all kinds of challenges that were there. So there's not been a lot of major -- there haven't been really any kind of external influences that would make us change our minds right now in terms of what we see for the rest of the year, which is kind of what I said at the -- in summary. What I said 6 weeks ago is kind of where we still are. Obviously -- and we're running our railroad 6 weeks ago really good. So like I said, not only externally, but internally, there's not a lot of change. And so our service is second to none. And our strategy to leverage that service and make sure that we are appropriately compensated for the service that we provide is still our strategy. And so that is not something that you want to turn on a dime and discount in order to put volume on the railroad. So it's going to be a methodical, strategic, rational growth story as we go forward and as we improve the efficiency and as we clearly distinguish our ourselves in the marketplace and show to the customers that we can create value for them. We will begin to have the growth. I believe we'll continue to have the growth or we will achieve the growth that we outlined to you in 2019 and 2020 and I see no reason to try and do something to accelerate that strategy. Fadi Chamoun : Okay. And maybe just 1 quick follow-up. When we look at the intermodal pricing, like what you're reporting in RPU and intermodal, like how well aligned is this with the current market rates that we're seeing on the truckload side? Or is there an opportunity to kind of move that materially as you kind of begin to touch a little bit more of your contracts? James Foote : I have the ability -- I do not have the ability to price my portfolio of business to the markets on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. We have kind of long-term contracts with our existing customers. So a large part of that business is locked up. The pieces of the business that aren't, I will take advantage of the market environment to price the business appropriately, but that's kind of methodical. These things roll over a little bit here, a little bit there, a little bit in the summer. So -- but more so than just a tightness in the truck market is the differentiation now in the quality of my service. And the reliability of my service is what's going to be the main factor in driving growth in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Just first question, Jim. Can you update us on how the apology tour is going and anything tangible you can share following the disruption last summer? And kind of related to that, Canadian Pacific put out a release last week. Seems that there's still significant gaps in terms of them reaching an agreement with their unions. If you could just help us think about what the exposure, if any, I'm sure there is some, for CSX, if there's any type of work stoppage at CP, either on the revenue side or the -- related to the cost actions. James Foote : No apology tour anymore. That's canceled. Nothing to apologize for. The railroad is running great. The railroad is running -- again, if you look at the metrics, our railroad is running better than anybody else in North America. And -- so I got a suitcase that it says I apologize on it. So maybe one of the other railroads wants to borrow it, but I'm not using it. In terms of the Canadian Pacific, I don't know if they're going to have a strike or not. I don't think they know if they're going to have a strike or not. And so I can't really speculate and I can't comment on that. Amit Mehrotra : Well, I'm not asking if they're going to have a strike. What I'm asking about is if they do, like what's the exposure to CSX? James Foote : I think that's a hypothetical question. So I just said I'm not going to speculate. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. I'll move on. And then just one quick one for Frank on the buybacks and debt levels. Just from the perspective of the rating agencies, I guess, the rating agencies look at balance sheet capacity and buyback. I guess, they have a couple different metrics and can -- maybe even conflicting with each other in terms of retained cash flow and the way they compute that versus maybe adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. And you could be well in the parameters of retained cash flows as a percentage of your total debt but kind of out of the parameters of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. So maybe it's a little bit too technical for sure, but if you could just help us think about how CSX thinks about its balance sheet, pro forma for all the share repurchases. You surely have the capacity, but just philosophically, if you can just help us with that, and we'd appreciate it. Frank Lonegro : Sure. We spent a fair amount of time with the rating agencies earlier in the year as we looked at our credit profile, we looked at debt that we wanted to raise this year, we looked at the sizing of the buyback program, et cetera. And I think we have a good understanding of where the breakpoints are. They obviously look at 2 key things at a very high level, one is leverage, and the other is coverage. And I think what tax reform has done is probably allowed a little bit more room on the leverage side because you've got more coverage, because you've got more free cash flow. So I think we've struck a very good balance. I think we have a very good understanding, and I think everything that we are proposing to do on the buybacks as well as on debt issuances later in the year are all right in line with the conversations that we have with them. So we feel like we're in really good shape. Amit Mehrotra : So just to press you a little bit more, if I could. As we look out beyond sort of the $5 billion framework that you provided and we kind of flex the beyond 2019, is it now kind of 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA, which is maybe obviously a little bit higher on a gross debt basis? I mean, is that the right sort of benchmark that we should think about from a modeling standpoint? Frank Lonegro : We said at the investor conference, and I'll reiterate here, that we're going to look at that on an annual basis. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Jim, can you just remind us of the level of business that you've looked at and said we don't really want to have that on the network anymore. Because as we look at your volumes trending early in the second quarter, I think you guys are close to flat on the publicly available reports. So how do we put that in context, the business that you walked away from? James Foote : Well, again, on the intermodal side of the business, as I think we've said in the middle of last year, we started to transition away from what we referred to us the hub-and-spoke model in intermodal. And in closing a number of lanes that we served, we took about 7% of the intermodal traffic off the railroad. And we're getting close to getting intermodal volumes back to flat with prior years, so we're replacing a large percentage of that business. And if our run rate is getting close to, on a volume basis, flat, that would kind of give me, as I said earlier, a little more confidence that we're going to be able to have a revenue line for the year which is slightly up. So it all kind of fits in with our prior view of the year that the volumes would strengthen across the board with coal as always being somewhat of a question mark for us, but they would strengthen as the year progressed, and we'd see enough in the second half of the year to offset what is a 4% decline in volume in the first quarter. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. Appreciate that. And when you look across the network, you do have headcount down quite a bit. I mean, like everyone talked about, your OR has improved pretty aggressively here. But what is left on the structural side? I mean, if you did have a big influx of demand, do you think the headcount levels can still come down or are you at a point now where you would have to be thinking about hiring more people and bringing on more assets? James Foote : Clearly, clearly, you'd have to have some sort of monumental increase in volumes for us to begin considering hiring employees back and assets. No, we've got 800 locomotives in storage. So we're in great shape to handle any kind of increase in volume. Forget about taking assets out. We still intend to improve the fluidity of the network. We still intend to improve velocity. We still intend to drive down dwell. We still intend to increase train length. All of those initiatives do two things, one, improve our operating leverage, drive -- which by driving down our cost and improving our efficiency, but they allow us, because of that, to add additional volumes with our existing asset base that we have today. We're handling just about the same amount of volume that CSX handed -- handled a year ago with 8 fewer hump yards, 1,000 fewer locomotives, 4,000 fewer employees, 20,000 fewer railcars. So putting more volume into this railroad that is going to continue to improve to be operated more efficiently is not going to be a challenge for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. Brian Ossenbeck : Jim, just a follow-up on the train length. I've been able to track those improving in the West and up North, but it's more recent phenomenon in the East. So I was wondering in a detention network, are there actual physical limitations to building train lengths, grade crossings or something like that? Or was it just more temporary and you just need longer sidings, the right balance to keep that track going? James Foote : No capital necessary in order for us to improve train length. We are not restricted by siding length. We'd have a long, long way to go before we would need to spend capital to be able to get, say, 12,000-foot trains out there. But if we were, that'd be good news probably, which I'm sure we'd consider if necessary. But that's not in our 3-year vision to be -- to have to spend capital to do any of those stuff. Frank Lonegro : Brian, two other things I'd add to Jim's good comments. One is we invested a fair amount on what we call the Southeast corridor, Chicago into the Southeast in the last decade or so, so we're leveraging that clearly. And then as Hunter, Jim, Ed and others have really looked at the network operating plan, we've done a fair amount to reduce congestion, i.e., to reduce the number of active trains. The number of meets and passes that you have in any given day is a lot less than it used to be. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Is there anything specific to the East, physical limitations, tighter, shorter distances between grade crossings that would limit train length growth from here? James Foote : No. No different. Brian Ossenbeck : Just wanted to clarify that. But if question was, just to go back to intermodal for a second, talking about disciplined growth in that business. Can you give a sense as to how you're handling the demand? But dwell times are up the terminals across the whole industry, so specifically, I wanted to get your comments on some of the terminal performance in the larger hubs like Memphis and Chicago in addition to the trade capacity serving those markets. James Foote : Well, we have improved the efficiency of our Chicago terminals, both Bedford Park and 59th Street significantly. Everybody had challenges at Christmastime, especially in Chicago and Memphis when the winter weather came in at Christmas day and just hung around for a month, so it slowed everybody down. Our dwells are -- both originating containers in our intermodal terminals and containers that arrived in our intermodal terminals, our dwells are down because our train service is becoming more reliable and predictable. And therefore, the trade community can rely upon us to be there and handle load for them to haul away. And then at the same time, as we mentioned earlier, with us being more clear in what we expect of our customers in terms of when those containers come into our terminals that we want them out. And if they don't want to get them out, they have to pay to store them. That is increasing the throughput and the fluidity of those 2 main terminals there. Again, Memphis has been a challenge for us, but Memphis is now running smoothly. And again, and I have a big focus on our intermodal terminals for this year. And I'm sure. I'm positive. In fact, I was just in Chicago going through our Bedford Park and 59th Street terminals. I'm sure that we can make improvements there that will improve throughput, which basically adds a significant amount of capacity without spending any money. Operator : Matt Reustle from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead. Matthew Reustle : Maybe if you can touch on asset sales for a moment here. Made some progress in the quarter. What do you expect to be the driver -- what determines whether you hit that $300 million base case or that $800 million in upside that you highlighted at the Analyst Day? Is it simply demand in the market? Are there certain assets that are tied to federal grants that make up a big portion of it? And I guess, if you can categorize the market for asset sales now, that will be helpful as well. James Foote : So on the real estate side, we're seeing, obviously, pretty stiff demand for what we put out there for sale. Mark Wallace and his team are working awfully hard to free up assets that maybe haven't been for sale for a while. Obviously, you saw a good down payment on that $300 million in the quarter from a line sale perspective. You've probably seen a little bit of traffic out of the STB on a couple of items that we have out for bid right now. And you'll continue to see us focus on that. It is not a demand-side problem. There's a lot of demand out there for infrastructure-type assets, so we think we're hitting the market at a pretty good time. Matthew Reustle : Okay. Got it. And just one more on the higher demurrage charges. Is this a case where you're hiring good rates on customers? Or is it you're becoming more strict on the chargeable days. Maybe you can walk through that. It seems like quite a jump for some of these customers' in just in one quarter. James Foote : Well, basically, what you're talking about is here is demurrage or detention, which is a standard operating practice throughout the transportation industry, whether it's the railroads, whether it's the steamship companies, whether it's the terminals. If your asset sits around at somebody else's property and you don't get it out, they charge what for what sits there because they can't use it while your equipment is sitting there. All of these charges, to a large degree, have been on the books of CSX for a long time, but were not necessarily enforced aggressively, or for one reason or another, a customer here or a customer there was given an exception to the policy because it was viewed as an incentive to the customer to come and do business with CSX. Under our current model, under scheduled railroading, we're focused equally on providing our customer with a fair value for what they pay us. But at the same time, having an intense focus on the value of our infrastructure and the value of our asset, and we are not just going to give that away anymore. So as -- again, as Frank made his comments, this is not something necessarily that we want to view as a profit center that we want to, in any way shape or form, gouge our customers. It is a simple fact of life that, again, when the car sits on our network, that -- or it is our car that has been delivered for unloading and it's not unloaded, we expect to be compensated for either the use of our track space where the cars are sitting or the use of our asset while it's -- we can't use it for another piece of business. And again, these are standard industry practices that we just are applying in a more uniform and consistent manner. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Justin Long : So maybe to address service first and take a bigger-picture approach. Clearly, you've shown improvement, but some of the other rails are struggling. Jim and Ed, you've seen a lot of service disruptions in the industry in the past. You know what it takes to fix some of these issues. With that in mind, when you look at the North American rail network as a whole today, do you have any thoughts around the timing of when we can return to an environment of normal fluidity? James Foote : No. I can comment on how CSX is running. I can't comment that, on when other railroads are going to do that. It'd just be inappropriate for me to comment. Justin Long : Okay. Fair enough. And maybe to go back to pricing for my second question. Seems like things are moving higher, coal being the exception. Could you talk about your view on coal pricing going forward? I'm just curious if you expect this downward pressure to continue and if you're pursuing any changes as it relates to the percentage of your contracts that have a fixed component. James Foote : Well, two pieces of businesses here, the export business, both of the thermal and met, pricing is kind of driven by other indices -- indexes that we really don't have a lot of control over, and so that piece of business kind of goes up and down with those indexes. On the utility side of the business, clearly, the coal-fired utilities, in competing with other utilities, generating facilities that are using natural gas to generate -- to run their turbines, the coal guys have a disadvantage just on a cost per million BTU basis. So to the extent that we can work with those customers, those coal-fired utilities, to give them a more -- a lower-cost basis on a delivered per million BTU basis, i.e., might involve cost of the coal post our transportation, we're going to try and do that and see what happens. There is a lot of coal to the utilities. The majority of the coal that comes from either the Powder River Basin or the Illinois Basin going to our utility. So there is a longer haul. The transportation component of that is larger than what has historically been the case just because it's moving a farther distance. And so if we can do something in that marketplace that will help our customer, that will allow us to use the fact that we've got coal assets, cars and locomotives to move it and it produces to us a very good return, we're going to try to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Hartford from Baird. Benjamin Hartford : Jim, any perspective on international intermodal, in particular, your service being a standout relative to the other rails. But any other concerns for the steamship lines with regard to network fluidity broadly in diverting some of the flows away from the East and the Gulf Coast over to the West to improve transit times? Have you seen any or have you heard any talk about that as we enter the spring peak? James Foote : I'm putting up a big for sale sign in, let's see, Jacksonville, Savannah, Virginia, Baltimore, New York, New Jersey. Open for business. Bring it in. We can handle it all. So I'm good to go. I'm ready to handle their freight and not going to -- not a problem. Benjamin Hartford : Okay. And then more broadly on protectionism. Several weeks now into -- a lot of the rhetoric around tariffs, obviously, on the steel and aluminum side and, on the grain side, down more recently. Any thoughts that you have as it relates to consequences near term that may have arisen given the rhetoric that we've now been absorbing over the past couple months? James Foote : No. I keep being asked to become an expert on tariffs, and I'm not. And so right now, everybody -- yes, everybody depends on what day it is as to whether or not this is viewed as a good thing or a bad thing. Anecdotally, we're looking at moving some more petcoke, and we're looking at some steel mills on a rail we're opening up. So that's just anecdotally. So I'm sure as things play out, if anything does come to be, there will be negatives and positives in it. And it's too early to try and guess what those might be. Operator : Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities, you may go ahead. Cherilyn Radbourne : Just wanted to ask a question around routings. One of the things I was struck by at the Investor Day was just how, in closing hump yards and in moving away from the hub-and-spoke system in intermodal, you'd eliminated some what would seem like very dysfunctional routings. Could you just speak about what impact all of that has on length of haul in merchandise in intermodal and what, if any, implications that has for RPU in those franchises? James Foote : Well, again, if you take an inefficient -- if you route a car in an inefficient manner, basically, you have artificially increased the length of haul, assuming that you can haul it in a more direct fashion and assuming that you do. And so by improving the efficiency of your network and by taking out all of these millions of out-of-route miles that we move cars on an annual basis, you're going to, theoretically and I would think actually, reduce your length of haul. At the same time, your revenue, if you just look at it on a revenue per unit basis, it's not going to change much. If you can get to a cents per revenue ton mile, you would see an increase because you're going to get the same amount of revenue and having less of the ton mile. So it's kind of a -- there are different metrics, but I think what you're trying to get to is taking something and moving it in a straight line is going -- versus a crooked line is going to be less miles, and you're still going to get paid the same amount of money for doing it. Cherilyn Radbourne : Great. And then maybe just by way of a quick follow-up, in terms of the equity earnings of affiliates, that's a new income statement line item. Frank, can you just give us some help on how to think about a normal annual run rate for that? Frank Lonegro : That's a great question, Cherilyn. So the equity earnings of affiliates, the reason that we had to create that was because the nonconsolidated subsidiaries, so you might know those as Conrail, TTX and the Belt Railway of Chicago, among some others, they had to actually revalue their deferred tax liabilities. And because of the size of those revaluations, we had to carry it as a separate line item. You saw a $25 million benefit in the quarter against a $13 million benefit last year. Obviously, those affiliates, when industry volumes are up, they do better. And when industry volumes are down, they may not do as well if they're not pulling costs out the same time. We did have some tax true-ups in there. We said on the call for the fourth quarter, we said think about a $10 million to $15 million per quarter credit there. We're probably at the top side of that one if you're thinking about it from a run-rate basis. Operator : Our next question comes from David Vernon from Bernstein. David Vernon : I just wanted to clarify, Jim, it sounded like you were talking a little bit before about the coal business trying to maybe get a little bit more aggressive to grow some utility coal business using price. Is that -- did I hear that correctly? Or what are you trying to get at with the utility coal pricing commentary? James Foote : Basically, what I said, yes, is on the Southern electric utilities to the extent that we can work with our customers, i.e., if it makes economic sense for us, CSX, to be more aggressive on price to keep those utilities up and running and using coal, we will try to do that. David Vernon : And can you bound that for us as far as kind of any sort of directional indicator of how much room there is to move in that stuff on the rate? James Foote : We have room to move. David Vernon : All right. And then maybe -- I'll follow up with Kevin off-line. But maybe, Frank, question for in the MS&O. How do you reconcile taking a lower accrual on the personal injury when the accident rates are up as significantly as they are in the quarter? Frank Lonegro : So what the actuaries do, this is not something that we do, it's something that we work with actuaries on. They look at probability and severity, so it has to do not just with the number of incidents but also the severity of incidents in its overall longer-term period of time. We give them all the data, they run the numbers, and we adjust the accrual as necessary. In some quarters and years, it might go up. In other quarters, it might go down. James Foote : Our accident rates -- actual accident rates in the first quarter this year, or not? Frank Lonegro : Yes, but the raw incidents that we had were roughly flat, both on a personal injury and a train accident basis. But obviously, what moves the ratio is the denominator, which is per million train lines on train accidents and 200,000 man-hours on PI. David Vernon : Yes. I mean, they're indexed to the volume of activity, right? James Foote : Right, which is not -- I'm not suggesting that, that's inappropriate. I'm just saying someone can look at the number and say, \"Oh my god! They're having a lot more accidents,\" when actually, we're either equal to or slightly less than, depending upon what day it is going forward in the year, kind of back where CSX historic -- to historical run rates and moving up vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the industry in terms of these numbers. Frank Lonegro : Yes. And the thing you have to remember, David, is in the frequency index, a sprained ankle counts the same as an amputation. I mean I hate to be that graphic about it, but what we look at and what the actuary looks at it is what is the frequency, so we talked about that, and then what is the severity based on our recent experience. So that's why you see the change. Operator : Our next question will come from Walter Spracklin from RBC. Walter Spracklin : What I'd like to focus in on is some of your opportunities after the full implementation of your precision railroading is rolled out and your service levels are really salable. Jim, can you focus in on what you've seen as areas or sectors that you really see CSX as being able to grow into a little bit more than either competitors or more than it has in the past? Are there any sectors that really excite you with regards to that of selling your service model once we kind of get through this phase of de-marketing and slower growth -- slower volume growth in 2018? James Foote : Well, clearly, much as you're familiar with this, much as that way we looked at this at the Canadian National in the early days, the benefits of this are on the merchandise side of the business. And having, on a revenue basis, 2/3 of your business tied to the merchandise segment, that's where you want to focus, and that's really where the value comes. And those are the customers today that are the easiest to convert because in most -- well, in all cases, they're shipping already today by rail, they're comfortable with shipping by rail, they're sophisticated and big customers who are shipping by rail and they're paying a premium price to move a large product -- same product that they're moving by rail in the truck where they want to get reliability. And the big area of opportunity is to convert those customers and other customers like them to your network on the merchandise side of the business. Half of the intermodal business is looking just for price, and the other half of the business is looking for just price, but at the same time, a really high premium service. So the area where you can focus and do the best good for CSX and the customer base is on the merchandise side of the business, and we'll be transitioning a much greater focus on the top line in the out years, than just truing up and improving the basic operation of the railroad. Walter Spracklin : Okay. That makes a lot of sense, Jim. And so reliability, how long do you think -- clearly, you're going to be increasingly -- have a reputation for higher reliability. How long do you think before those truck customers buy in and trust that by going over they're are going to get that reliability? Is this something that you got to build out over quarters or over years? How long do you think that'll run? James Foote : Days, week, quarters, months, years, it depends upon who the customer is. It depends upon where you're doing it. And most of it as in any business, you got to go in and sell to the customer on the idea of converting. And as I said earlier, these guys are sophisticated purchasers of transportation that know rail and they know truck, and they'll scream at you every day that they have to pay premium prices when your service is not good, i.e., they got to pay more to put it in a truck. And so you just got to go onto them and prove lane by lane by lane by lane that you can handle their product to their valued customer and do it in the same way at the same level efficiency and reliability that they get out of a truck. They don't necessarily need it there at 24, 48 hours. They needed there with a degree of reliability that if you say you're going to do it in 4 days, it's there in 4 days 85%, 90% of the time. And if you can do that and not have the outlier where, \"Oh, that load didn't get there for 12 days, and this one didn't get there for 10 days,\" that's how you win it back. Walter Spracklin : Makes a lot of sense. Okay. Last question here. Senior management, now when you look across a group -- you got a good set of railroaders here. Any areas where you think you're going to be looking to add or ameliorate over the next -- in 2018 in your senior management ranks at all? James Foote : I think, well, clearly, based upon the results and the performance and everything I've said since I've been here, we got a great team of people that know what the heck they're doing. And as I said, I'll match these guys up with anybody in the industry, and I think we've proven that with our first quarter results that we can perform with anybody. And -- but yes, there are some holes to fill in the organization that everybody is aware of. And Ed and I are working very, very hard to make sure that we find the right people and the right talent who can fill those roles. And we'll probably -- moving some things around by -- during this year more to give people, again, opportunities to show what they can do in certain roles. And we're not sitting still and sitting back on that area either. Everything here is all systems go, improve the place and run it better and better every day and make sure we have the future leaders for CSX ready to go when called on. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen. Jason Seidl : I wanted to touch back on price a little bit, excluding the coal franchise. Jim, I think you mentioned there was some sequential improvement there. Can you give us a sense of how much of your book of business for 2018 has already been repriced? James Foote : In what segment of the company? Jason Seidl : Ex-coal. James Foote : All right. I guess it's safe to say that kind of we have -- best way, say, 1/3 of the business rolls over every year. That's kind of a good metric to use. And we can't -- I'm not going to -- can't give you any much more guidance than that. Jason Seidl : Okay. And piggybacking on some of your comments on the call. You mentioned that you might change some of the pricing dynamic. Should we think about it as maybe you guys setting this up something that links to a natural gas index like a Henry Hub to be more flexible given some of the utility's needs? James Foote : That would be the obvious methodology to use. Operator : Our last question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Just wanted to make sure I understand your strategy on intermodal here with what's going on in the truck market. Are you saying that you are focusing more on getting pricing from existing customers versus focusing on truck-to-rail conversion? Or is it -- or are you pursuing the volume opportunity as well? James Foote : Well, clearly, we're focused on two things, one, growing the business; two, profitably. So volume with price equals top line growth. And whether that's an existing customer giving more volume or whether it's a new customer that could give me volume I don't have today, that is always the equation. I do not have a scorecard in my office that says R to R, or whatever you call it, road to rail and how many did I get today. That's not a game that's going to make me any money. Just taking a truck off the highway and putting it on the railroad, if it's not priced right and it's not moving in the right and specific corridor, it adds no value to me. And at the end of the day, it adds no value to the customer because we probably don't do a very good job for him. So whether it's an intermodal customer or whether it's a merchandise customer, the whole objective here is to go to the customer and say, \"I can provide you with value,\" whether it's the merchandise customer that we talked about before or whether it's the intermodal customer who wants to take advantage of the railroad in connection with his over-the-whole trucking -- over-the-road trucking operation. I need to provide value to him and make sure that, that value to him, I get paid for. And if the 2 don't align, if the guy wants me to add value and expects me to give him a discount at the same time, then we don't -- the stars don't align, and he probably goes someplace else. Ravi Shanker : All right. Understood. And just one housekeeping for Frank. On the real estate gains, I think you had indicated at the Analyst Day that you expect that run rate to step down in 2018 versus 2017. But you had $30 million higher this quarter versus last year. I know that's a lumpy line, but what can we expect in terms of the cadence of that in the coming quarters because right now it looks like it's going to be a significant headwind unless you guys kind of step into the extra $500 million bucket? Frank Lonegro : So Ravi, we're not trying to time this at all. When the assets are up for sale and they are ready to close, we close them. Like you said, it's going to be lumpy in terms of the quarters and years. We set that goal of $300 million in real estate sales. It's aggressive but achievable. And you might remember that in Mark's remarks at the investor conference, he actually said he thought there was some upside to that, which isn't in the targets that we set. So we're not trying to time it at all. We're going to go as fast as we can and put the money in the bank as fast as we can. Kevin Boone : And so I think we're done with all the questions, so we'll wrap it up here. Operator : And thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.",

Baird Bascome Majors - Susquehanna International Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the CSX Corporation\u2019s Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Boone, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Amber, and good afternoon, everyone. Today -- with me on today's call is Jim Foote, Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Lonegro, Chief Financial Officer. On slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on slide 3. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim Foote : Thank you, Kevin. Well, it\u2019s great to be with you this afternoon. Thank you all for joining our call. In order to get started, I guess, the first way to kick it off is, the press release that we put out says it all, record financial results. These results are due to the hard work of all CSX employees, who, I can tell you, are really excited about what has been accomplished. We will all celebrate a little bit tonight and then it's back to work tomorrow and continue to drive change to fully realize the potential of this company. Before I turn to the slides, let me comment on a couple of key initiatives. First, safety. We intend to be the safest railroad. In May, our new Chief Safety Officer, Jim Schwichtenberg joined the company. Schwich comes to us with 20 years of railroad experience, including almost 10 years with the FRA. I'm confident that he can bring new approaches that will drive an improvement in our safety performance. Also in May, we engaged DEKRA, a highly regarded expert in helping companies improve their safety performance. A comprehensive safety assessment is underway and I expect positive changes to materialize as a result. The entire organization is committed to being the best in safety. Second, we recently announced the appointment of Mark Wallace as Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing. I have known Mark for a long time and his ability to lead, combined with more than 20 years of scheduled railroading experience will allow our sales and marketing team to work more effectively with our customers and drive profitable growth. Diana Sorfleet will take over most of Mark\u2019s former portfolio, assuming increased responsibility as Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer. Diana in her role at CSX\u2019s Chief Human Resources Officer has built a big -- has been a big part of our transformation by driving a more productive and engaged workforce. Her new responsibilities, which will now include technology and labor relations provide a significant opportunity to drive a more focused organization. Now to get to the slide, let\u2019s turn to slide 5 and start with our results, two words I think sum up everything, great performance. Just like the first quarter, there's nothing unusual in these numbers. They're very straightforward. EPS increased 58% to $1.01 versus last year\u2019s adjusted EPS of $0.64. The new lower tax rate and lower share count, down 6% contributed to the significant year-over-year increase. Our operating ratio improved 490 basis points to a record 58.6% compared to last year's adjusted OR of 63.5%, clearly the lowest ever for CSX and I believe the lowest ever by a US railroad. The significant year-over-year improvement in our results was driven by 6% top line growth, combined with price and lower costs, pretty much across the board with the exception of fuel. Revenue increased 6%, as price, fuel surcharge, supplemental revenues and a 2% increase in volume, all contributed to positive growth this quarter. Similar to recent trends, we did see slight improvement in pricing this quarter, excluding coal. Quick look on the next slide on the business segments, each were -- which were positively impacted by higher fuel and price. In chemicals, strength in industrial products, plastics and crude by rail was partially offset by our fly ash losses, which we discussed last quarter. Auto saw strength based on North American US light truck production, which was up 5%. In Forest Products, lumber, panel, wallboard and paper products all increased in the quarter. In metals, shipments of sheet, steel and construction related field products drove increases. Fertilizer\u2019s revenues as I have mentioned previously were mainly lower due to the Plant City facility closure last year. And in the coal markets, export coal remained very good during the quarter and showed healthy gains. Utility coal continued to weaken. On the intermodal side of the business, growth continued to come from the international markets with domestic relatively flat on a year-over-year basis because of the line rationalizations that we went through in the fall of 2017. Other revenue declined $58 million or declined due to a $58 million of liquidated damages, which was in last year's results, which did not repeat this year. Excluding that item, we saw gains in supplemental revenue, including demurrage. We continue to work with customers to create a more fluid network, especially as we approach the fall peak season. On slide 7, let\u2019s take a quick look at some of the key operating metrics that this team is focused on. Train velocity increased year-over-year and on a sequential basis. Terminal dwell saw an 11% year-over-year and 7% sequential improvement. While we drove improved velocity in dwell, train length increased on both a year-over-year basis, 13% and sequentially, 5%. Let me tell you, improving all three of these metrics at the same time is no easy task. Finally, car miles per day showed low double digit improvement on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. This is a good measure of asset efficiency and our ability to effectively turn our assets. The improvements we saw in these metrics clearly translated into our financial results. Now, let me hand it off to Frank who will go through the financials in more detail as well as the benefits of these operating improvements. Frank Lonegro : Thank you, Jim and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to slide 9, I\u2019ll walk you through the summary income statement. Reported revenue was up 6% in the second quarter, driven by 2% more volume, higher fuel recoveries and solid core pricing gains across all major markets. Same store sales pricing, which reflects year-over-year increases for stable traffic improved sequentially in the second quarter. Pricing for merchandising and intermodal contracts that renewed in the second quarter was strong, exceeding same store sales pricing growth. Other revenue was down year-over-year. Now, the benefit of higher demurrage and storage charges mostly offset the cycling of $58 million in liquidated damages from the prior year. Note that we now expect other revenue to remain in the $130 million to $140 million per quarter range for the remainder of the year. Moving to expenses, total operating expenses were 8% lower in the second quarter or 2% lower after normalizing for last year's restructuring charge. Overall, labor and fringe savings of 82 million or 11% year-over-year were driven by an 11% reduction in average headcount. This smaller labor footprint spans both the operating and G&A departments. On the operating side, year-over-year improvements of 7% in velocity and 13% in train length drove more efficient use of our train crews and rolling stock. Even with 2% volume growth, train and engine employee road starts were down 9%, while yard and local starts also fell 9%. And the level of recruits, a signal of network fluidity, dropped by 15%. Shifting to mechanical, the active locomotive count was down 13%, reflecting our ability to keep over 600 locomotives in storage, despite higher volumes. The smaller fleet along with great car repair efficiencies helped drive an 18% decrease in our mechanical craft workforce. We recently aligned the engineering function to the regional structure we have for mechanical and transportation, which will also yield headcount and other efficiencies moving forward. Our G&A headcount continues to decline, as we look for every opportunity to absorb attrition. Over the past year, we have eliminated unnecessary layers of management, yielding a structure that is cost effective and enables rapid communication and decision making across our network. MS&O expense was down 5% against the prior year. As you look at the year-over-year comparisons in MS&O, recall that we are cycling a $55 million gain from a favorable legal judgment in the second quarter of 2017. This year, results benefited from $37 million of real estate gains, as we continued to make headway in monetizing our surplus real estate portfolio. These gains are consistent with our guidance to achieve $300 million of cumulative real estate sales through 2020. From an operational perspective, many of the key drivers of labor expense favorability also yielded savings in MS&O in the quarter, as lower asset and resource levels helped drive down MS&O expense. Material savings attributed to the smaller locomotive fleet were complemented by our decision to store units that are less reliable. The decisions we\u2019ve made around storage combined with additional fleet reliability efforts drove a 33% year-over-year improvement in our locomotive out of service measure and further reduced costs related to materials and contracted services. Looking at non-labor costs associated with our train crews, the reduction in road crew starts combined with better network fluidity yielded lower [indiscernible]. Additionally, MS&O continues to benefit from our efforts to streamline contractors and consultants, particularly in our technology department. Consistent with our prior guidance, we remain on track to reduce our total workforce by 2000 resources by the end of 2018. Looking at the other expense items, depreciation increased slightly as the benefit of asset sales mostly offset the impact of capital investments. Yield expense was up primarily due to a 36% increase in the per gallon price that we were pleased to achieve record fuel efficiency in the quarter. We will continue to drive further fuel savings through continued improvement in network fluidity, train length increases and the use of fuel optimization technologies. Higher equipment rents expense is mainly attributed to volume growth. These volume related increases were partially offset by improving car cycle times across most markets. Equity earnings were favorable due to improved performance at our affiliates in addition to a non-recurring benefit from an affiliate\u2019s property sale in the quarter. Given the recent strong performance, we now expect core equity earnings of affiliates of $20 million to $25 million in Q3 and Q4. Lastly, just as a reminder, we are cycling 2017\u2019s restructuring charges. Looking below the line, interest expense increased primarily due to the additional debt we issued earlier this year, partially offset by a lower weighted average coupon rate. Tax expense was lower year-over-year, even with higher pretax earnings, given the benefits of the new lower corporate tax rate. Our effective tax rate was 23.3% in the quarter, slightly lower than our prior guidance, mainly due to a one-time benefit from state legislative changes. Going forward, absent one-time events, we expect our effective rate to be around 24.5% for the back half of the year. Moving now to P&L, as Jim highlighted in his opening remarks, CSX delivered record operating income of nearly $1.3 billion and record operating ratio of 58.6%. Turning to the cash side of the equation on slide 10, year-to-date capital investments were lower by 14% and keep us on track for our three year $4.8 billion capital target. The reduced capital intensity of the scheduled railroading model, the substantial core earnings progress detailed on the prior slide and the benefits of tax reform helped drive a nearly $600 million increase in year-to-date adjusted free cash flow. Significant improvements in free cash flow generation combined with higher leverage enabled us to nearly double our shareholder returns compared to the first half of 2017. We have now completed approximately $2 billion of the current $5 billion buyback authority and remain on pace to complete the program by the end of Q1 2019. As we stated at our investor conference, CSX will continue to evaluate cash deployment and shareholder returns on an annual basis. In closing, I will reiterate the three key priorities that drive this management team on a daily basis, ensuring the safety of our employees and communities, delivering great service for our customers and appropriately rewarding our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Foote : Great. Thanks a lot, Frank. Turning to the last slide number 12, while we've achieved a lot in a very short period of time, we are far from where I believe we can go. As many of you know, we just rolled out our trip plan compliance a few months ago. We're in the early stages of driving improvement in this metric and there is significant opportunity there to get better. Trip plans are so important, as we think about delivering even better customer service and asset efficiency. It allows us to track every car and container on our network and identify at a very discrete level where we may have a problem. This allows us to know why something happened, so we can react and more importantly, fix any problems so it does not repeat. I mentioned velocity and dwell earlier. Clearly, to be the best, we have more room to improve. Our train speed specifically, we have significant opportunity to improve as we remain below the industry leaders. Our dwell is better than the industry average, but again there is significant runway for opportunity before we can call ourselves the best. Cars on line continue to be a focus of this team. We\u2019re in the business of moving cars and the more efficient we get, the less cars we need to move with the same -- to move the same volume. But turning cars faster, it also frees up capacity for us to take on additional business. Finally, fuel efficiency. Diesel prices are up, so this becomes even more important. There are many ways to drive improvement in this area. [indiscernible] this quarter was $270 million in cost. So we're in the $1 billion run rate range for the full year. These are big dollars. For trip optimizer to distributed power, we will use all of these to drive improvement and lower cost. Now, on revenue. We are raising our full year guidance from up slightly to up mid-single digits. At some investor conferences, I said we were trending to be a little better than where we thought we would be at that time of the year. This slightly higher outlook is a reflection of a number of factors, including our belief that export coal strength will continue, higher fuel prices will remain in a healthy economic backdrop. Obviously, there are factors we cannot control, mainly the economy that can provide some variability as we get into the back half and fourth quarter specifically. But this is how we see it today. In closing, we have shown a relentless focus on executing our business model, but let me assure you we have an eye on the horizon to develop long-term sustainable growth. Our business practices are new to CSX employees, but are becoming part of our DNA, as we work hard every day with the goal of becoming the best run railroad in North America. Thank you and I\u2019ll turn it back to Kevin. Kevin Boone : All right. Thank you, Jim. In the interest of everyone\u2019s time today, I would ask that everybody limit themselves to one question and one short follow-up if needed. Operator, we will take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Mehrotra. Amit Mehrotra : Hey, thanks a lot. Congrats on the great results. Jim, the OR obviously in the second quarter is below the target that you set for 2020. I fully understand the nuances of seasonality and the risk around the macro. But would it be fair to characterize the 2020 target as conservative based on what the team has achieved so far? And if so, what do you feel maybe is a structural limit of where you can take that OR over that time period? Thanks. Jim Foote : Well, over the time period, what we laid out just three months ago when I stood up there and said, we had a target of 60 in three years and I think everybody in that room kind of thought it was crazy that we'd never be able to get there. So -- and it's only \u2013 we\u2019re only two quarters in. So we're not -- clearly not changing our guidance here and what we think is achievable. And as I said, we have a lot, a lot of work to do and we got a lot of help this quarter from coal. So, if things continue to align, I continue to say I have confidence that we can hit a number, 60, which everybody I think thinks is extremely, extremely impressive. So there's no change in this short period of time from what we laid out just a quarter ago. Amit Mehrotra : Right. Okay. And just kind of related to that as my follow up. Your comments at the end there with respect to where you are in implementing PSR and just a lot more room to go in terms of low hanging fruit on the cost side in particular, I would imagine, can you just talk about where PSR is not represented in the network today, I guess, some of the new initiatives that you're taking on specifically on the intermodal franchise in terms of implementing schedule railroading, that strategy on that particular business. If you can talk about some of the places where it's not represented and the opportunity there more concretely in terms of reductions in dwell time or things like that. That would be great. Jim Foote : One answer, intermodal. Our intermodal network needs a ton of work in order to become the efficient part of our system that it needs to be and we're just really beginning to get in there and start to figure out how to rationalize that big part of our business, so we can become much more efficient and have a much better product for our customers. Amit Mehrotra : And does that -- should we be watching origin dwell time yields in that business? I mean, how should we monitor looking outside in terms of your progress there? Jim Foote : I mean, all of our \u2013 yeah, it will be reflected in all of our metrics. Again, our terminal dwells are pretty good. But we have a network franchise here that, to a large degree, is dysfunctional and it is the product for many, many, many, many years, CSX having a standalone intermodal entity. So we need to kind of go forward and reconfigure the franchise and make sure that it is properly and appropriately integrated into the rail company, so we can achieve the benefits of operating more effectively and efficiently. So we are at very, very early stages, a lot of work to do in that area and every other area, as I said. Yeah. We had some great results and we did that. We don't have the highest velocity. We don't have the lowest dwells, so we have a lot of opportunity ahead of us to get EBITDA. Amit Mehrotra : Yeah. Makes it seem just [indiscernible] so conservative. But I will \u2013 those are my two. So I will leave it there. Congrats again. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Ken Hoexter : Hey, great. Good afternoon and again congrats. It's a phenomenal job on the operating ratio so quickly. But Jim, I guess, on the on-time originations and arrivals, both are down year-over-year, but you noted the calculation has changed in the details, but the results were restated to conform. Why are they down, given the network improvement and how everything's accelerated on the network? Jim Foote : We're pretty comfortable. Obviously, we'd like to be better on the originations. We depart our trains pretty close to on schedule. We don't get them across the network as effectively as we should. We depart, if we give ourselves, which we don't, but if you did from an accounting standpoint, give yourself a couple of hours of flexibility on either end, we depart 90% our trains to schedule and we get to destinations again with that two hour cushion over a three day operating period in the 80% range. That\u2019s unacceptable. You know what, that always comes up with -- for a number of different reasons. And so we need to just continue to be able to work to eliminate the causes of failures and that's why our trip plan compliance is in the kind of 60% range. We need to get that up to 100% and when the trains fail to arrive on time, they miss their connections and therefore, we\u2019re off the trip plan. So all of those things need to improve. And a lot of it has to do with culture, where people recognize that there's going to be a failure and they go above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that we get the box that makes the connection on the next train. As I said many times, what does a UPS employee do when he sees that a box is not going to get in the truck, he runs behind the truck down the road and makes sure that he gets the box on the truck. Our guys are going to wait for the train, see you later and the car runs a day later. So, it's culture and it's all kinds of changes that we need to take place in order to get better. Ken Hoexter : Wonderful. Thank you. And if I can get the follow-up on pricing. Frank, you mentioned that pricing accelerated on a pure pricing basis. Are there levels you can talk to, especially given how tight the truck market is? Can you be any more specific in terms of, are you seeing it growing, it, going 100 basis -- 200 basis points up on a sequential year-over-year basis from where you were. Frank Lonegro : Yeah. Ken, I think you probably know the answer to that question. I think what we're trying to help you understand is the environment is a strong environment and that's why we're seeing the contract renewals coming higher than the same store sales pricing. I think the last public number we have out there is in the Q3 of 2017, at 2.2% for merchandising intermodal. What we can say is that we have seen sequential improvement every quarter since then in same store sales and the discretionary renewals in Q1 were better than that and the discretionary renewals in Q2 were better than that. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital. Brandon Oglenski : I don't know if Mark is on the call, but I guess for Jim or Mark, it seems the improvement here is coming maybe a bit faster as the first two questions kind of alluded to. I mean, does this in any way change your philosophy on the revenue outlook? I think at the Analyst Day, you were seeing, look, maybe, we'll get a little bit of growth in \u201918, but obviously you're seeing a bit more now. Does that -- because of the changes you made in the network, is the market that much stronger and now with a lower cost base, does that change the dynamic on focusing between price and volume at all. Jim Foote : As I said at the Investor Day and as I said basically ever since I\u2019ve been here, number one, I don't differentiate in the implementation of scheduled railroading that you ignore your customer and don't focus on growing the top line, as you implement your operational changes. You do that at the same time. So -- and we have been working to improve the quality of our service and work with our customers to grow our business throughout the last six months and with I would say pretty favorable results and responses from our customers. They went from -- when I showed up here to hating me to now on occasion even buying me a drink. So we made great improvements in our customer relationships. And so, but I don't see a differentiation here. I also don't look at this as oh, you\u2019re a price leader or a price taker. We\u2019re focused on volume, we\u2019re focused on price. We're focused on growing our business with long-term sustainable, profitable business that people recognize that we have differentiated ourselves in the marketplace, we have a better product to sell to our customers and our customers recognize that by working with us and paying us more, because we're a better quality product, they can save money in their business. That\u2019s our strategy, that\u2019s our strategy to grow the business and that has been our strategy since day one and will continue into the future. Operator : And next, we'll go to Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah. Good afternoon and great results. I'm sure everybody is going to refer to that, but they\u2019re obviously very impressive. Let\u2019s see. What do you think about OR in second half? I mean, you\u2019re sub-60 in second quarter, it probably implies numbers ought to go up in the second half. Is it pretty reasonable to think sub 60 in second half as well or is there anything in terms of maybe no incentive comp, is it a tailwind, that would be a headwind or anything else we ought to consider when we think about second half OR relative to the really strong results in second quarter? Jim Foote : Sure, Tom. From a seasonality standpoint, the second quarter for CSX is always the best. So one would assume that that's going to always be the best this year too. Going forward into the second half of the year, number one, the way we account for our vacations, we have a disproportionate amount of labor expense associated with vacations in the second half of the year. We have a 3% wage increase, around 3% wage increase in the second half of the year. So, those are headwinds that we have planned for and have expected all along. And then, the most reliable variable is the weather here in the fourth quarter, which is a new phenomenon for me and Mark, where you've got a hurricane in Florida and the Gulf, while you're worrying about freezing rain in Atlanta and snow in Chicago and along Lake Erie. So we always seem to have weather that makes it more difficult for us to operate in the third quarter and fourth, I mean it\u2019s fourth quarter. So those are the kind of things that we look at and say, it is totally rational and what we believe to be the case that our expenses in the third and fourth quarter will be higher than the second. I can tell you that they will be lower than they were last year, how about that? Tom Wadewitz : Sure. That's fair. I appreciate the color on that. Let me ask you also, you made a comment on the intermodal network. Seems to imply you might simplify it further. I don't know if that\u2019s accurate or not, but how do you think about the potential changes to get the intermodal network right? Is that simplifying the flow, fewer touches, and what might be the timing for that? Is that something that you can do pretty quickly or is that something you need to kind of plan and execute over multiple quarters and maybe you see that result in 2019? Jim Foote : I think as I said earlier Tom, we\u2019re just starting to really peel this back and understand what changes we need to make. Obviously, last year, I mean it was well talked about. [indiscernible] changed the philosophy and got rid of the hub and spoke, that was about 7% of the volume that was taken off the revenue, taken off the railroad. And at that point in time, it was my belief that a large part of that rationalization of intermodal has been accomplished, well, that's not the case. So -- but we're going to take it very methodically. We are going to have very good and open communication with our customers about what it is we're trying to accomplish and it involves train design changes, it involves terminals and terminal -- potential terminal consolidations. And we will do this very methodically and logically and appropriately and do it, being fully aware of the fact that we are looking at a peak season this year, which everybody is indicating us is going to be very strong. So we're not going to do anything that's going to screw up the railroads. So if it takes a little longer, then a quarter or two, I\u2019m fine with that. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Chris Wetherbee : Wanted to touch a little bit on sort of the revenue and volume outlooks. You\u2019re taking the revenue numbers up. I think, some of that is driven by what you're seeing on the other line, but how do you think about the sort of volume outlook and maybe sort of queuing up the competitive environment. You brought the OR down arguably a lot faster than most of us had expected. Did that open up new opportunities? Do you see some of that in the second half? How do you kind of think about those opportunities going forward? Jim Foote : I believe that the operating ratio is a reflection of the efficiency of our service, which in my mind, means that we continually improve the product that we offer to our customers. We are not working diligently to drive down the operating ratio, so that we can be the price leader in the marketplace. So I think as I said last time, we don't get stickers and bonus points for volume. And therefore, to the extent that we can sell our product as a superior product in the marketplace, we fully intend to do that. Clearly, we have as much flexibility as we want to, if there are unique opportunities in the marketplace, where a customer to us is not interested in quality of service, but is only interested in price and it makes sense for us, being the low cost provider, to pursue that business, we can do that too. So we have all the flexibility in the world to pursue whatever business segments we want. Our principal objective here is to be a better run network that has a differentiated service product in the marketplace that demands a higher price for that and we can grow business at the extent of truck, which we already know the customer is paying 15% to 20% more for, so why discount your better quality product when you know you can go, save the customer money by having a service that\u2019s more truck like. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. I guess it sounds like there might be an opportunity there on the volume side, that's helpful. And then getting a little bit more specifically, you think about export coal as you look out into the back half of the year, I know this is the tough commodity to predict, but you\u2019ve given us some help in the past and you don\u2019t expect any changes to sort of that high 30 million ton number that we\u2019ve talked about for 2018 as we look out into the second half? Jim Foote : Yeah. On the second half, I mean, clearly, one of the reasons that we have talked now about higher volume is because export coal has been better in the first half of the year and appears that it will be better in the second half -- slightly better in the second half of the year than what we originally expected. Frank, maybe you have some further comment on that. Frank Lonegro : Yes. So we were at about 22 million tons in the first half. If the framework holds as Jim mentioned in his opening remarks and we see the indices hold at 200 and 100 or higher on the met and the thermal index, you can see that same run rate prevail in the second half. So early to mid-40s would be probably a decent range for it. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Scott Group : So wanted to follow up on the intermodal and what you've been talking about. Jim, maybe give us some perspective, where is this OR relative to the rest of the business, are we 1000 basis points behind, maybe 2000 basis points behind, if you can maybe directionally give us some color there? And once you've got it all optimized the way you want to, how close do you think intermodal margins can be to the rest of the business. Jim Foote : Well, as I think I tried to portray, we have a lot of areas in intermodal where we can make improvements. And we don't describe the various business segments in great detail in terms of what's more profitable than the other, even around this business moving up, which ones are. I can tell you when we did this, when I did this at CN, and we got involved and did the same thing at GM, we fixed the merchandise business and then we went over and started it and then we went over and started fixing the intermodal. And intermodal at GM was a basket case. When we were done fixing it over a couple of year period, the average profitability of our intermodal business there was better than the corporate average. So we\u2019ve got a ton of work to do and I couldn't be happier that Mark is here to do it. So -- and we'll just keep updating you, but it's going to be slow, it\u2019s going to be gradual and it's going to be a good process that works for our customers as well. Scott Group : And then just real quick, some number questions. The raise in the other revenue guidance, is that because customers are not changing behavior or you're rolling it out to more customers and then do you have any way to \u2013 70 million of real estate in the first half, any way to put a range on what you think is realistic for second half? Frank Lonegro : Hey, Scott. On other revenue, I\u2019d say it's two things. One, the behavioral changes that we're looking for obviously through the increases in the rates of the reduction of free days, it just isn't happening as quickly as maybe we thought it was three months ago, it was going two, three months ago. So that's, I think, the answer on that, we did roll out some additional policies effective July 1, so that then bleeds into the run rate there. On the real estate side, yeah, you're right, we had about 70 million in the first half. So we had a good first quarter, a good second quarter. You all probably saw a line sale that was announced with OmniTRAX a couple of weeks ago. That combined with some smaller transactions that we may close in the third quarter, I\u2019d say will have a good third quarter, not unlike what we saw in Q1 and Q2. Operator : And we will go to Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Brian Ossenbeck : So wanted to talk about the domestic coal side for just a bit. I would say, the volumes or challenges remain a challenge for the first half of the year. Are you seeing anything from structural competition from new gas fired power plants, gas pipelines going further down south, especially into Florida and do you still have confidence that there's going to be no material retirements of coal fired plants this year or through the next couple of years through 2020. Frank Lonegro : Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Frank. I think the utility story has largely stayed the same. Nat gas is 275-ish, which isn't all that helpful to the environment, though stockpiles in the south have come down pretty significantly, the cooling degree days are up year-over-year. We're just not seeing the burn rates go up in coal quite yet, but a lengthy autumn and a cold winter will certainly help those. In terms of your structural competition, again, we don't know of any plant closures that are going to impact us significantly in the next couple of years that are new. Clearly, we have a couple that are going to roll off. We knew about those, we've adjusted our outlooks for those, but nothing new. Brian Ossenbeck : Could you give us a quick update on the lease and license? I guess the wires and pipes, the other ancillary revenues, are those things that you're starting to be able to monetize it or is that something that will start to pick up in the back half or 2019? Thank you. Frank Lonegro : Brian, both. We\u2019ve had an ongoing business of licenses and leases that utilize or cross over the quarter. Mark and his team have been increasing those over time and will continue to deliver and are on track to deliver the $300 million guidance that we gave you at the Investor Conference over three years. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Reustle of Goldman Sachs. Matt Reustle : You're obviously ahead of schedule on the network improvement and that\u2019s boosted the 2018 revenue outlook. Does that also raise the potential for revenue in \u201919 and \u201920 and I guess the real question is, does your 4% revenue CAGR target increase beyond the 2018 bump that you're guiding to now. Jim Foote : I would say, at this point in time, no, for the two principal reason that I talked about. One is one of the most significant reasons that we're looking at higher -- have looked at higher volume and revenue in the first half of the year was export coal and one of the principal reasons we're talking about being more optimistic for the second half is because of export coal. And I don't know at this point in time that anybody could tell you what the future is beyond December 31 of \u201918, what export coal is going to do. So it's a little premature for us to start saying that that's going on. And at the second time, I am at -- because we are in the early stages of this network reconfiguration in Intermodal, I don't know what implications that might have on revenue growth in Intermodal at this time. So I\u2019ll just have to stick with, hey, here's what we, where we are today, what we think the rest of this year looks like in terms of being mid-single digits and for now, we\u2019re in the same mode, looking at \u201919 and \u201920, about where we were three months ago. Three years ago, but it was only three months ago. Matt Reustle : And the second question, just still early days on trade and tariffs, but can you talk about high level, where you see your business sensitive, are you hearing or seeing anything from your customers in terms of talking about adjustments relative to the tariffs, any color on that is helpful? Jim Foote : Well, again, there's so much noise swirling around about tariffs. In terms of the specific impacts on CSX today from any kind of tariff activity, clearly, first, was steel. And from a steel standpoint, both finished steel out and/or business in, we have seen some positive as a result of the US steel manufacturers kicking up production. The second area where there have been some real activities involved export soybeans. Our export grain business in total is around 30 million bucks. About a third of that is soybeans. And so in the grand scheme of things, in terms of soybeans going to China, it's really not a factor at all for us. And then the third area which again has not had any real activity, but again a lot of noise about it is both NAFTA and Europe in terms of tariffs on imported autos, we are not impacted in terms of imported autos from Mexico. We would clearly watch carefully, if anything were to be put on imported vehicles from Canada. But nothing has happened there yet and in terms of European imports coming in through the East Coast ports, normally, they don't touch rail anyway. So not much of an impact at all right now and our customers continue, despite the fact again that there is much discussion that this could lead to an economic downturn, our customers seem to be -- continue to be very optimistic about the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : Maybe that was a good segue into my somewhat pessimistic question, but how are you thinking about CSX\u2019s ability to turn what have historically been fixed costs into variable costs in a downturn? And is the network at a point where if volumes dried up tomorrow, you'd still be able to generate significant OR improvement. Jim Foote : Well, that is pessimistic. And it\u2019s such a big occasion for us here, but I'll try to deal with that and it's not something that Frank and I don\u2019t talk about on a regular basis here. Having myself been through with a couple of times, but all of a sudden, yeah, your volumes just go away. And again, because of all the speculation just in the media about tariffs and trade wars and what could that, so we\u2019re always doing recession scenarios here about what if this and what if that. Clearly, as we get better and as we get a better handle on our operations, we will be able to more quickly respond and make appropriate adjustments to our variable costs in the event of volume declines. And you obviously have the wherewithal at your fingertips to reduce your fixed costs to a degree, meaning fixed labor. It's just how much you need to do in order to do that. Depending upon what kind of economic decline scenario you came up with, I guess my thoughts are, if we, again assuming a severe decline, if we were able to maintain our plan and they're at least the status quo, we would be able to be -- we would be doing a very good job. If it's a minor thing, then it\u2019s probably a minor thing and continue to stick with the program and see what we could do to make our numbers. Allison Landry : And then as my follow up, if you think about the disparity between your service metrics and your competitor and within the context of your earlier comments about pricing for a better service product, do you expect to pull the growth lever perhaps earlier than what we saw at CPE and OCN? Jim Foote : Again, we never push the growth lever the other direction. We are always in the growth mode. It was \u2013 and again to a lot of this, I wasn't present here, but many people that work here, Frank were, it was tough to grow when your railroad wasn\u2019t running in product and cars that should have been across your network in three to four days, we're taking three to four weeks. So that's difficult to say I'm in a growth mode at that period of time. Once the service is improved and where the service is today, we're always looking to get business from -- more business from current customers, business back from the former customers, all of that and \u2013 but it is \u2013 again, it is our philosophy that we want to be the premium service provider in the marketplace and get paid for. Operator : Our next question comes from David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein. David Vernon : Jim or Frank, could you help us -- you mentioned earlier in the call that coal helped you out a little bit here in the quarter. Is there any way you can help us to mention how much coal has contributed to the year-over-year sort of profit development in the company in the first half of this year? What I'm just wondering is how much of the very, very aggressive improvement in operating income due to chalk up to kind of PSR versus how much of it would you chalk up to help from the commodity markets. Frank Lonegro : Obviously, it\u2019s helped from a lot of different areas, precision railroad is clearly one. When you look at the levels of efficiencies that you're seeing, the headcount reductions that you're seeing, the asset reductions that you're seeing, those producers build dollars and significant dollars. If you look at the point that Jim made around export coal, just to dimensionalize it, we moved a little over 11 million tons in the second quarter of this year. And last year, moved a little over 8 million tons. So you can get a feel for the uptick in export coal. At the same time, we saw some reduction in utility coals. You got to net those two things out, they\u2019re both good pieces of business for us. We want to move them both, but there's a whole lot more that\u2019s happening in our company other than coal. David Vernon : I totally agree with that. And -- but I guess I was just wondering if there was maybe an indication you can give us for directionally how much export coal rates have moved up on a year-over-year basis in relation to domestic coal rates? Frank Lonegro : We generally follow the indices. We don't follow on one for one. So when you see them, you see the forward curves move up. Generally speaking, our pricing is going to follow that -- again that one to one. The highs on the benchmarks are going to be higher than our price. And the lows on the benchmark are going to be lower than our price, but we generally are going to follow those. When you look at it on our view basis, you can get a feel for what the export RPU is and what the domestic RPU is. There are times when the exports are higher. There are times when the domestics are higher. But it\u2019s really going to depend on what those external benchmarks are. But again, there's a lot more happening here and I don\u2019t want you to lose sight of that by focusing on coal. David Vernon : Yeah. Absolutely not I\u2019m losing sight on, I'm just trying to get you to tell us what happened to the export coal RPU? We\u2019re not going to do. So maybe \u2013 Jim Foote : You\u2019re going to get that for me and I\u2019m going to get that for Frank. David Vernon : Let me ask a quick follow-up question, Frank. When you think about the gains you had at MS&O from idling some of the spare locomotives, is there a chunk of that that maybe snaps back as you start to run a little bit hotter and leaner or is it all just pure kind of run -- you should run rate these levels on the cost side going forward. Frank Lonegro : Remember, you got real data in that line item. So be careful not run rating real estate on that basis. I\u2019ll try to give you some detail on Q3. But when you look at what we're doing, the smaller locomotive fleet is clearly a driver. You\u2019ve got contractor and consultant eliminations, which are rolling through that line. You\u2019ve got -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks, less hotel and taxi costs. You\u2019ve got G&A. Fewer people obviously spend less money on the MS&O line, so as long as you\u2019re seeing those things stay the same, excluding the real estate piece, I think you can run rate those. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Long of Stephens. Justin Long : Wanted to start and ask about headcount. Do you have any updated thoughts on where headcount will end this year? Just curious if your expectations have changed? And based on how the network has performed during the first half of 2018 and what seems to be a better than expected start as it relates to volumes, is there any change to the expectation for headcount that you're targeting in 2020 as well. Jim Foote : No. In terms of this year, again, we're slightly ahead of where we -- the run rate to get to the 2000 reduction, but that was planned for as I said earlier because of vacations and other purposes that we would have an accelerated pace in the first year of the year. So we're right on target to hit the number for this year and nothing has changed in terms of the number for the three year plan. Justin Long : And maybe to circle back on the increased revenue guidance for 2018 as well, is there a way to help us think about how you would allocate this increase between one, a better outlook for export coal and two, a better outlook for everything out? I'm just curious if that split is 75%, 25% or how you would quantify that. Jim Foote : Without getting into the specific volume details by the various commodity groups, I\u2019m trying to come up with a more simplistic way to answer that. I think if you look at our coal business in the second quarter and I think that's a relatively good run rate. Again, we had a great -- we just got to tell you, we had a great second quarter with strong export demand and weak utility demand. That's kind of a norm for us for this year and -- but we expect that kind of run rate to continue in the second half of the year. So I\u2019ll now give you some guidance in terms of volume from coal. And the rest of it is going to come primarily from merchandise, which is again across the board, all of these various commodities that I talked about metal, forest products, blah, blah, blah, were all relatively strong in the second quarter. That's just a reflection of good markets and customers recognizing that we've got a good service product. And so that's kind of, I would say, that that will give you a better run rate view of what we think the top line is going to do. And then as both Frank and I mentioned, you\u2019d layer in continued reasonable pricing environment, continued recognition of supplemental revenues from the demurrage policies that we are now -- policies that were in existence for many, many years, but now, we're collecting on. And then thirdly, a little bit more fuel surcharge because for instance, fuel is going to get up and I think the second quarter will give you a pretty good understanding of why we think that the second half of the year is going to be a little bit better than what we originally expected. Second quarter was a little bit better than we expected, kind of started talking about that earlier in the quarter when I said we're going to be a touch better and then now, we came in with 6% growth. And so if things stay the way they are right now, I think that leads us down the road of giving you a pretty good way to get to a general view of how you get to mid-single digit top line growth for the year. Operator : And our next question comes from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital. Walter Spracklin : I want to come back, Jim, to your answer to a previous question with regards to exactly that the trends you've been noting in the back half of the year have picked up. And I think what you said in the last -- just now is that it wasn't all just due to coal. There was other factors due to better pricing and better volume in other areas. I'm just curious as to why that wouldn\u2019t change your view into 2019. Why would it all stop as of December 31? Wouldn't there be a carryover in the first half of next year, even if commissions remain that will lap easier comps that would give you a bit of better lift into next year? Just curious as to why you wouldn't expect it to continue more than just six months. Jim Foote : For the two reasons, I said. One, I don't have a clue what coal is going to be like in \u201919 and \u201820. And I don't know what the implications are to our intermodal franchise by some of the work we have to do there. So those \u2013 the uncertainties surrounding those two big components of my business give me pause to say that out of the new norm for \u201919 and \u201920, I need to get a little bit further down the road this year to have a better -- more -- a clearer view of the year after. Walter Spracklin : Okay. And just on the pricing environment, can you talk to us a bit about kind of the cadence in the negotiations you have now versus one month ago, versus three months ago, versus six months ago, particularly where trucking comes into play on your intermodal franchise or where you come head-to-head with your competitor? Are you finding that is there any capacity constraints that are allowing for the movement of price to come in a little bit, not easy, but easier than it might have one, three or six months ago? Jim Foote : Well, six months ago, we had our \u2013 and telling everybody how sorry we were for not running a very good railroad. So the environment for us right now compared to where we were at the end of last year is dramatically different. In terms of the pricing environment and the capacity environment, it's a good time to be in the railroad business. It's a good time to be in transportation business, it\u2019s no secret that the pricing environment is strong for everybody. As I said, and again, but as I said earlier, we are in this to grow the top line through long-term, sustainable, profitable growth. I don't play in the stock market. I'm not worried about volume. I\u2019m not worried about timing to rail, awards that kind of stuff. Long-term, sustainable profitable growth where we provide value to our customers and our channel partners and everybody in the marketplace is our strategy and that is what's going to make CSX the best. Walter Spracklin : If I could sneak one last one here in terms of when you sit down with Mark now in his new role, what do you guys talk about as your kind of objective. Number one, I think you alluded to is it the Intermodal franchise or is there something else that you want to kind of zero in on as his number one objective as he starts the role? Jim Foote : One of Mark\u2019s strengths and one of the reasons I'm so excited about Mark taking over the job besides the fact that he\u2019s a really bright guy, he\u2019s got great relationship skills and we need to develop long-term solid relationships with our customers. There has been a lot of turnover here at the senior management of this company. We hear this all the time. We don't know who to call, we don't know who you guys are. You got to hold the team there, what am I supposed to do, who do I call if something goes wrong. So number one, fix intermodal, but two, start build back the long-term relationship that CSX should have and I\u2019m totally confident that Mark's going to do an exceptional job in that area. Not to say that the guy that runs our merchandise group, Michael Rutherford and his team are doing a phenomenal job in that area. But again, I know Mark and I\u2019ve been around for a long time and I think that's where he can do some great work for us. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Ravi Shanker, Morgan Stanley. Q - Ravi Shanker : A couple of follow-ups here. Just on the Intermodal and your comments on the tons of work you still need there and eventually getting that up to an above average margin profile. Can you just help us understand how much of that is fairly basic blocking and tackling that can be achieved pretty easily versus maybe bigger, longer-term initiatives like yard automation or something. Jim Foote : This is blocking and tackling. This is just running a good railroad. I'd like to be in a position where we will run it so well that we could start to look at ways to adopt new technologies to help us run things better. We\u2019re long ways from that. This is just basic core \u2013 fixed, bunch of broken windows. Ravi Shanker : And just a follow up, when you think of auto as an end market, is that primarily in your autos volumes or do you also have smaller auto components or something running through intermodal? Jim Foote : We have auto parts. We have auto parts in our intermodal. Basically, imported parts. And we have auto parts in large cars and merchandise service. Racks, frames, et cetera. But the primary volumes are in finished vehicles that are moving in tri levels and bi levels. Ravi Shanker : Is there any way to quantify your overall auto\u2019s exposure in terms of volumes kind of combined across segments? Jim Foote : We could -- not off the top of my head, but if you give dates with Kevin, we can see if we can try to come up with some way for you to \u2013 some percentage. For every vehicle, how much moves kind of a general percentage. For every finished vehicle, what the percentage of a car kind of a thing, we might be able to come up with something that gives you guidance on that. Operator : Our next question comes from Benjamin Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Benjamin Hartford : Real quick, Jim. What are -- in the context of intermodal and the work that needs to be done there, as you think about the back half of \u201918 and through \u201919, whatever the plan may end up being in terms of volume growth, what do you think the box count needs within UMAX specifically are going to be to support growth. Will it grow in line with volumes or is there enough opportunity as you work through that network and improve velocity that -- perhaps that fleet size does not need to grow to be able to satisfy volume growth targets. Jim Foote : Yeah. Under the current scenario, I don\u2019t anticipate us making any investment in boxes for UMAX. Operator : Our next question comes from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna International. Bascome Majors : Frank, years ago, in the prior regime, you guys used to make some directional comments around the profitability of different commodity groups. I know putting hard numbers to that was declined earlier on this call, but I am curious with the overall profitability of the franchise, moving up 12, 13 points in less than two years here, has the directional sort of contribution of the various revenue groups that you do, has that changed dramatically? I\u2019m just curious if we're kind of in a new game as to versus the historic playbook of what's the best business for you and what's not? Frank Lonegro : So Bascome, a rising tide lifts all boats clearly. In a good pricing environment and a good efficiency environment, you're going to expand your margins. When we look at the profitability, I could show you intermodal moves that are at the top, and I could show you coal moves that are more towards the bottom and merchandise runs at the same spectrum. So, we\u2019ve got a good portfolio of business. Obviously, when you see a 58.6 operating ratio across, that portfolio must be pretty good and we\u2019re going to continue to optimize it and drive that long-term profitable growth that Jim mentioned. Operator : And next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities. Cherilyn Radbourne : Just wondering if you could speak to some of the mixed dynamics in the quarter. RTM is up 7% versus 2%, carload growth would suggest a pretty big shift. So maybe you could just give us some color there. Jim Foote : Ton miles up 7. Frank? Frank Lonegro : Yeah. So I think what you're seeing is, when we did some of the network changes last year, as we closed terminals, et cetera, we probably introduced some auto rack miles and we're now pulling those down pretty significantly. Ed and his team are working on that. I think you'll see that continue to come down and that disparity that you mentioned I think will get a lot closer as we go forward. Cherilyn Radbourne : Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the whole intermodal discussion. As you continue to reposition that network, do you continue to be able to leverage the benefits of a hot trucking market from a volume and a pricing standpoint? Jim Foote : A good time to be in the railroad business and it\u2019s even a better time to be in the railroad intermodal business. So, yes. Just take a look at it, as I said earlier, we took 7% of our business off the network last year and we're flat today. So people are looking for capacity. We want to be able to provide that service and capacity to our customers. We just want to make sure that we have a rational footprint of an intermodal network, when we are going into the marketplace and selling a product to our customers and that's just going to take us sometime to straighten that out and then we are going to be back there, doing whatever we can to help out the -- again our channel partners principally who work with us, who want to use intermodal to reduce their costs as well as the growth that\u2019s coming with some of our other partners, as their volumes grow enormously with the growth of e-commerce. So this is a good time for us to be here. We just need to make sure we fix it and that's what we're embarking upon doing and look at what we've done already with the company in terms of making improvements and this is just one more area where we're going to take all of our efforts and initiatives and tap into the brainpower of guys like Wallace and Harris and make intermodal a huge franchise. Kevin Boone : Amber, I think that wraps up the queue. And I would like to thank everybody for joining the call and I'm available for callers afterwards. Thanks. Jim Foote : Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. You may disconnect your lines.",

Baird Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the CSX Corporation Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Boone, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Shirley, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call is Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Lonegro, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President for Sales and Marketing. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure followed by non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim Foote : Great. Thank you so much, Kevin, and thank you everyone who is on the call. We are very excited about the strong performance of the railroad. Incredible things can be done by incredible people. The CSX workforce is proving every day that they are not going to back a backseat to anyone when it comes to running a safe, customer focused, and efficient railroad. I want to give a special shout out to the operating team that positioned our effort out of harm\u2019s way in advance of the recent hurricanes. And to Ricky Johnson and all the engineering folks that did an amazing job in getting us back up and running with minimal delay in the aftermath of both storms. Before moving to third quarter results, I\u2019d like to comment on a few initiatives we worked on in the third quarter. First, we made changes to the organizational structure on our operating apartment, which pushed more real time, decision-making to the field. Our management team has embraced the change and I am encouraged by the early positive results and momentum it has delivered. Second, we announced new major initiatives at our Northwest Ohio Intermodal terminal. This facility functions has a sorting facility under the previous hub and spoke strategy. We will now leverage this app tech and its important strategic location as a traditional Intermodal terminal to drive new revenue opportunities. As part of our plan, we are working with NorthPoint Development to establish a logistics park adjacent to the terminal. This logistic center will require no capital from CSX. We also announced the new haulage agreement with BNSF. That enhances western access to the facility. And we are working on expanding access from these coast ports. I believe these initiatives will drive long-term growth opportunities to CSX. Now, let\u2019s get to the results. I said it last quarter, and I\u2019ll say it again today. Two words sum up everything, great performance. Nothing unusual, again, these numbers are straightforward. EPS increased 106% to $1.5 versus $0.51 last year. Operating income growth of nearly 50%, combined with the lower tax rate and 6% fewer outstanding shares contributed to the significant year-over-year increase. Our operating ratio improved 970 basis points to 58.7, a substantial improvement and a record third quarter for CSX. The operating results are highlighted by 14% complex growth including 4% volume growth, combined with lower expenses despite much higher fuel costs. Let's turn to Slide 6. Revenue increased 14% at volume, price, fuel surcharge and supplemental revenues all contributed to positive growth this quarter. Looking at the business segment, each was impacted by positive price and fuel recovery. Merchandise revenues grew 12% this quarter, helped somewhat by lapping some of the service issues last year. Nearly every end market saw a double digit increase with the exception of Fertilizers, which was impacted by a previously-disclosed customer shutdown. I am encouraged by the broad-based growth across this portfolio. Coal revenues increased 14%, with strength in our export business offsetting domestic utility weakness. We also saw good growth in our steel and industrial business. In Intermodal, we saw a growth from both price and volume. Finally in other revenues, similar to previous quarters, we saw an increase in supplemental fees including demurrage. On the next slide, Slide 7, let's take a look at our safety performance. The safety of our employees is my number one priority. As you can see on these charts, we made some good progress this quarter, and we need to sustain this momentum. The personal injury rate this quarter is encouraging but we must improve by training accident rates. As I had mentioned, we have an initiative way to drive further improvement. We have a strong turn-up by employee in our recent safety survey, which is a good sign of employees' involvement. I will continue to prioritize safety above everything else and expect us to make further progress. On the next slide, Slide 8, on the efficiency and service slide. Train velocity and dwell both saw improvement - significant improvement over last year. And they're also much better than last quarter, velocity improved 28% and dwell improved 26% both on a year-over-year basis. Cars online continues to trend lower, down almost 14% year-over-year despite volume increasing 4%. This really shows the improved asset utilization we are achieving. And you can see our trip plan compliance. This is a very important measure as it reflects not only the railroad's operating performance but most importantly, how we are performing from a reliability standpoint for our customers. We have seen an improvement of 26% from the first quarter to the third quarter this year. And we just started measuring this in 2018. While we have made good progress, there is plenty of room to improve. Now, let me hand it off to Frank who will take you through the financials and operating improvements in greater detail. Frank Lonegro : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before walking through the financials, we've got a number of questions on hurricane impacts. So let me give you a quick summary. The most significant impact from hurricane Florence was the loss of over 5 miles of track due to numerous washouts from flooding. As a result, the majority of the financial impact was capital in nature which I\u2019ll discuss in a few moments. In terms of the P&L, we estimate the EPS impact to be about $0.02 in the quarter similar to Hurricane Irma in last year's third quarter with most of the impact contributed to lost or hurt revenue. With respect to last week's Hurricane Michael, given the location of the landfall and the speed of the storm, we do not expect the impact to be significant in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 10, I'll walk you through the summary income statement. Reported revenue was up 14% in the third quarter, driven by 4% lower volume and revenue per unit gains of 9% from higher fuel recoveries, favorable mix and core pricing gains, as well as higher other revenue. The overall pricing environment remained strong in the quarter with healthy demand levels, tight trucking capacity, higher fuel prices and support of export coal benchmarks combined with an improved CSX service product. As in the first and second quarters, pricing for merchandise and Intermodal contracts that renewed in the third quarter was particularly strong. Other revenue increased year-over-year,' reflecting the benefit of higher emerge and storage charges. We still expect other revenue to be in the $130 million to $140 million range for the fourth quarter, but likely toward the higher end of that range. Moving to expenses, total operating expenses were 2% lower in the third quarter reflecting the benefits of scheduled railroading, as expenses were favorable year-over-year even with higher volumes, higher fuel prices, and the impacts of inflation. Labor and fringe expense decreased $30 million or 4% year-over-year as average headcount was down 8% despite 4% more volume, the smaller footprint spend with operating and G&A departments. On the operating side significant year-over-year improvements in velocity, on time originations and arrivals and trip plan compliance led to significantly fewer active trains and crew stops during a 20% improvement in train crew efficiency as measured by GTM's for active training and employee. Now productive recrews an indicator of net validity also improved by 58%. Shifting to mechanical support labor, the active locomotive count was down 12% year-over-year including an active fleet reduction of over 300 engines since the end of Q2. We now have over 800 locomotives in storage in addition to the hundreds of engines we've sold, scrapped, or returned since the beginning of last year. The smaller fleet along with freight car repair efficiencies helped drive 11% year-over-year decrease in our mechanical craft workforce. Our G&A headcount also continues to decline as we look for every opportunity to absorb attrition. With these operational and G&A labor efficiencies plus the contracted workforce reductions I\u2019ll discuss in a moment, we have nearly achieved our full-year 2000 total resource reduction goal we set out on our January call. MS&L expense was lower by 9% versus the prior year. From an operational perspective, improved service levels combined with resource and asset efficiencies also yielded MS&O savings. Material savings attributed to the smaller locomotive fleet are complemented by our decision to store units that are less reliable. The decisions we\u2019ve made around storage, combined with additional fleet-for-liability efforts drove a 34% year-over-year improvement in our locomotive out-of-service measure and further reduced costs related to materials and contracted locomotive maintenance services. Looking at non-labor costs associated with our train crews, the reduction in both road crews starts and recrews yielded lower hotel and taxi costs. Additionally, MS&L continues to benefit from our efforts to streamline contractors and consultants, particularly in our technology department. Similar to recent quarters, results benefited from line sale and real estate gains that were $52 million higher than the prior year. We are continuing to monetize our surplus assets and are making good progress toward our $300 million target of cumulative real estate sales through 2020, along with the potential for upside from line sale proceeds. We continue to have a strong pipeline of real estate and line sale opportunities, though the impact of these transactions will continue to be uneven from quarter-to-quarter, and year-to-year. Looking at the other expense items, depreciation increased slightly due to impact of larger net asset base. Fuel expense was up 31%, primarily due to a 27% increase in the per-gallon price and increased volumes that we were pleased to achieve record fuel efficiency in the quarter. We will drive further fuel savings through continued improvement in network solidity and the increased utilization of fuel optimization processes and technologies. The equipment rents expense declined 18%, driven by significantly improved car cycle times as we continue to see strong year-over-year and sequential service improvements. Equity earnings were favorable, primarily due to the impact of the lower tax rate than our affiliates. We still expect equity earnings of affiliates of $20 million to $25 million in Q4. Looking below the line, interest expense increased, primarily due to the additional debt we issued earlier this year, partially offset by a lower weighted-average coupon rate. Tax expense was lower in the quarter, even with significantly better pre-tax earnings, reflecting the continued benefit of tax reform. Our effective tax rate was 22.3% in the quarter, slightly lower than prior guidance, mainly due to the settling of state tax matters. Absent unique items, we expect our effective rate to be in line with prior guidance of around 24.5% for the fourth quarter. Closing out the P&L, as Jim mentioned in his opening remarks, CSX delivered operating income of nearly $1.3 billion, third quarter record operating ratio of 58.7%, and earnings per share of $1.05. Turning to the cash side of the equation on Slide 11, year-to-date capital investments are lower by 15%. While we remain on track for the three-year $4.8 billion capital target, we now expect 2018 capital investments of about $1.7 billion, up from the prior target of $1.6 billion. The incremental capital spending is being used to accelerate positive train control from additional investments in positive return projects and pay for repairs related to Hurricane Florence. The reduced capital intensity of the scheduled railroading model, the substantial core earnings progress detailed on the prior slide and the benefits of tax reform helped drive a 55% increase in year-to-date adjusted free cash flow resulting in nearly 100% free cash-flow conversion of net income. This significant improvement in free cash flow generation helped drive a nearly 50% increase in shareholder returns. We executed $1 billion of share repurchases in the third quarter and have now completed over $3 billion of the current $5 billion buyback authority and remain on pace to complete the program by the end of Q1 2019. And as we have stated throughout the year, the CSX board will continue to evaluate cash deployment and shareholder returns on an annual basis.  With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Foote : All right, thanks, Frank. Turning to Slide 13 and wrapping it up on a kind of a forward-looking basis, on last quarter's call I said we were expecting revenue growth for this year to be in the mid-single digit range. We are now looking for full-year growth to be 6% to 8%. Clearly, we are doing better than we expected coming into the year. A lot of this is due to the continued strength of export coal, but all of our business groups are doing well. On the Intermodal side, we have made significant slides in reengineering our franchise to give what I believe we need to be to drive sustainable profitable growth. Our customers understand what we are trying to accomplish and are engaged with us to make our Intermodal product better. As I sit here today, only eight months since our investor conference. By almost any measure, we are ahead of where I thought we would be. This team has delivered significant value to our customers and our shareholders by running the railroad better and better every day. I am proud of what has been accomplished and encouraged about all the opportunities in front of us. Our goal of making CSX the best run railroad in North America is clearly obtainable. Throw it back to Kevin. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Jim. In interest of trying to get to everyone, I will ask that panelists limit themselves to one question and one follow-up as needed. Shirley, we'll now take questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Allison Landry : I wanted to ask about the revenue per RTM trends this quarter. It looks like it was up a little more than 3% for the first time you've seen since 2Q of 2017. So just wanted to understand what's driving that, if it's mix, price, a combination thereof and if there's an impact that we should be thinking about or if this helps us to understand the success of PSR so far? Frank Lonegro : I\u2019ll just comment last one. The RTM growth that we saw in Q3 is a combination of everything. So, strong pricing environment, mix, and volume. So, yes I missed the last part of your question. Allison Landry : I was asking about if this tells us something about where you are with the success or progress of precision railroading so far? Mark Wallace : I would say, yes. Clearly, we are doing very well. And service is excellent. The pricing environment is very, very good. Customers are moving more freight back to the railroad. And that is a trend that will continue. Allison Landry : Okay. Thank you for your time. Jim Foote : Allison, it's Jim. Clearly, part of our strategy here is to price appropriately for the service that we're providing and to the extent that CSX gives you a better product to sell, you\u2019re going to recognize higher prices as we go forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. You may ask your question. Chris Wetherbee : Wanted to talk a little bit about OR expectations as we move forward. Obviously, the operating ratio is performed extremely well over the course of the last couple of quarters. I guess Jim, as you're sitting here thinking about sort of what you're doing on the Intermodal side, can you put that into context with your 60 OR target that is out there? Maybe how you think about the timing of getting towards that and maybe the sustainability of these very good margins that we're seeing? I guess I'm trying to get a sense of how far along on the progress you already mentioned you were ahead that you expected to be several months ago. I don't know if there's certainly a new way to think about the opportunities going forward? Jim Foote : Well, I guess as I said, as I was trying to get to without being too specific because we're not going to be too specific, today anyway. Eight months ago, we put out a target to have 60 operating ratio in three years, and I think at that point in time everybody thought we were crazy and that couldn't be done. And now we've come in with two consecutive quarters in a row of - not industry-leading right there with anybody else in the industry. So, and as I have said on the last few quarters, I have a little more confidence that we can hit a 60 operating ratio in three years when we\u2019re kind of there today. So, but in no way, shape, or form is that indicative of the fact that we've run out of opportunities. We're just, as I said, I'm comfortable with the reengineering steps that we've taken to date on our Intermodal business, but we're holding back because we made a commitment to our customers we wouldn't make any kind of dramatic changes until after peak season. We're holding back and we\u2019re going to be doing some more work, that we've already discussed with our customers in terms of some line rationalizations, internal consolidations, and what we're talking with Northwest Ohio, we committed to growing that business. But we're going to grow that business in a logical process that is sustainable and profitable for us, all of which gets us opportunities to further reduce our operating ratio as we go forward. So, a ton of opportunity ahead of us, and so hang in there and see what we can do for you next quarter. Chris Wetherbee : And then just a quick follow-up on the pricing side. I know you don\u2019t give a core pricing metric anymore, but, Jim, you've been helpful in terms of characterizing the price environment over the last couple of quarters, just wanted to get your thoughts on 3Q maybe as it stands relative to the last couple of quarters. Frank Lonegro : Yes, what we said, Chris, in our prepared remarks was that the renewals continued to be strong and certainly in comparison to a same-store sales type of a measure that continue to be elevated against that benchmark. We restructure contracts from time to time, we did have one that was a little less than we would like, but other than that one, you would have seen a sequential - continued sequential increase in same-store sales. So, yes, the environment is really good, the backdrop macro is really good, the service product is really good. As Jim mentioned, Mark's got his team is fully engaged in driving forward and really thinking about what we're going to do in the next couple of quarters getting into 2019. The normal escalators like ALEF and RCAF and things of that nature all look pretty strong quarter-over-quarter, so those are also helpful as we think about contracts that are longer term in nature. So, nothing's really changed from what we told you last quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Jim, can you give us a little bit more context about just in general. You\u2019re not going to give too many details today on the Intermodal side, but just what are some of the challenges and the opportunities of making these adjustments, given that CSX was a kind of stand-alone entity in Intermodal, maybe compared to when you were at CN? And where do you think the margin profile can actually go over time? Can it get to the corporate average at CSX? Jim Foote : I'll take that second part of your question first. I think so. My history at CN was that that's what we did. We took it from the slowest dog to the middle of the pack. And I firmly believe that if you believe in your franchise and you believe in the quality of your product, if you can sell that as a value-add service to your customers and not just as a commodity that's going to trade the marketplace based on price. And I think, based upon capacity and everything else that's an issue with our channel partners, we bring to the trucking industry and those people that use Intermodal a tremendous product with a tremendous value. And we still have a long ways to go to get that franchise right. Part of the process is disassembling the old independent structure of the company because it's not an independent company. It's part parcel of the railroad. Those trains run on the railroad. They don't run on an Intermodal railroad, they run on the key railroad. So, all of that goes towards us building a much more efficient, highly effective, and better-quality product for the customers and that's what's going to drive the growth and that's what's going to increase the - improve the profitability of the business segment. Brian Ossenbeck : And then, Frank, can you just give us an update us on export goal for 4Q? Seems like it's running at the run rate you'd mentioned last time. If you can't give us the mix of thermal and met or at least some characteristics of that would be helpful? Mark Wallace : So, it\u2019s Mark speaking. Export coal, we believe heading into the back half of the year, the back Q4 of the year, it's going to remain very strong. Demand is still very strong. Benchmarks are still very strong. And so, we think we are going to see continued strength in our export coal business here, heading into the end of the year. Operator : Next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Amit Mehrotra : Congrats on the very strong results. I feel like I've been saying that a lot to you guys this year. Jim, export coal has obviously - just following up on the last question - obviously been highly accommodative which has helped this year's performance as well. So as we think about walking the operating ratio from 2018 to 2019, how much of the improvement we could see will be predicated on what export coal volumes do next year? Just given how much growth we've seen this year in the business? I'm just trying to calibrate our expectations, my expectations for what the improvement could be in '19 given maybe some of the idiosyncratic events for this year related to export coal. Thanks. Frank Lonegro : I would say it's more of the, what if something happens to coal and what would the impact be on our performance going forward, as opposed to - I mean it's not like we're going to add another 40% more export coal products while lot of are getting either mid-50 operating ratio. So, we're assuming and have assumed during the planning process and we'll probably - based upon where we stand right now, things on a forward-looking basis for export coal into 2019 look pretty good. And that will be what we'll base our plan on and then we'll continue to look for ways to become more efficient. As I said, it's much more of an issue of what would be a fit and how effectively can we pivot and react in the event something happened to the coal business. And that's something that is of right now that we are obviously speculating. We need to maintain a healthy coal business going forward because it has a meaningful impact on it. But if something happens to the export Coal markets, where they soften up a little bit, we'll pivot and we'll adjust just like all good railroads - all good precision scheduled railroads do. Amit Mehrotra : I guess you're just going be a 60 OR this year. I wonder if you're looking at the business -- I'm sure you're looking at the business many ways, but one way you\u2019re looking at is what the underlying margins of the business you're doing, the growth we see in export coal volumes and maybe that's the reason the 2020 target should actually be 60% given the fluid nature of those cargos or that freight? Jim Foote : We're not commenting on your 60 number there, either this year or in 2020. When we look at the underlying business, the margins on the business segments are all improving independently, not just because export coal is having a good run. Amit Mehrotra : If I could just ask one quick follow-up. One of the big pieces of the cost structure that you guys have been able to leverage is obviously the number of employees and employee headcount was down another I guess almost 8% in the quarter. As your volume guidance is going up - sorry, your revenue guidance is going up, should we expect a flatter kind of employee headcount into 2019 and 2020 because - or will you still be able to kind of leverage that and see higher revenue and lower number of employees? Jim Foote : Well, we will continue to become more and more efficient, how are we going to measure it, on a GTM basis, on an RTM basis, on a Carload basis. And our plan will be to continue to see a reduction in the headcount. Like I said, we're not in a position right now. Again, January we said we're going to take 2,000 employees out of the Company this year. We already got 2,000 employees out of the Company this year. Will we have a target for employee reductions, employee efficiency next year? Yes. And what that number is, at the right time we'll articulate it to you. And we will continue to become on a per unit basis, more and more efficient all the time. However, when we get to the point, and again, a lot of that has to do with our - the attrition rate and how we manage the expectations of our employees through this process. But when we get to the point where we need to handle the volume, we're not going to run ourselves out of a couple break done here and there to screw up the railroad. So, we'll -- we'll adjust. There are certain points on the railroad today where you need employees in one location and you have excess in another, so you're always managing your workforce appropriately and we'll do that on a go-forward basis. Frank Lonegro : You should expect, obviously, when the business comes in - merchandise and Intermodal, we've got ample capacity on those trains to be able to add it with very high incremental margins. If it comes in unit train commodities, certainly the margins there are good and you would want us to add any additional resources we need to be able to handle that. But I think, to Jim's point, you should expect us to continue to leverage resource efficiencies over time and our business is going to continue to grow. That was part and parcel of the framework that we laid out for you at the investor conference in March. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Dexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Ken Dexter : Hey, great job, but if we can just touch on the efficiency there, Frank or Jim. You talked about more room. Hey, is there more room on the equipment reductions as well? Or now that you\u2019ve put all the locomotives aside and the cars, is that kind of the end of the equipment side of your efficiency gain? Frank Lonegro : Never. We took out three - again, we took out 300 vista this quarter. We're always - again, we're at, in the quarter, I don't know what the velocity, 17.8, 17.9, something like that. That's way behind the industry leader. Way behind the industry leader. Since then, now we're up around 19, still way behind the industry leader. As we improve velocity, as we improve throughput, as we improve all aspects of the railroad, what does it do? Creates capacity, i.e. takes out locomotives. So, we\u2019ll continue to take out Locomotives. We'll continue to take out railcars. We'll continue to free up capacity across the railroad and into terminals, just as we -- because we will drive more and more efficiency and fluidity in the network. And so, therefore -- again, that's how -- that's why the employee count goal is down. Employee headcount goes down because we need fewer load, as an example, we need 32 locomotives for every mile an hour we can improve on velocity. So, every 30 locomotives means you need fewer people to maintain the locomotives, which means you need fewer facilities to maintain the locomotive. And on and on and on and on. Fewer cars online, get them offline, get them moving, fewer people to maintain the cars, fewer pieces of inventory. So, that's the nature of the game here, is continuing to drive throughput. And as I said, in terms of dwell, we're not the leader in dwell, we're not the leader in terms of velocity, but we will be. And as we do that, we'll free up and ship more and more assets. Ken Dexter : That's really great detail and insight. I truly appreciate that. Frank, maybe another one. I just want to clarify something you said earlier. You said there was a contract that you didn't get what you wanted. Excluding that, I think you said rates would have been up sequentially. Maybe if you can just kind of clarify or detail what you were saying there in terms of what was going on with rates excluding - I don't know if that was including a bad contract or something? Frank Lonegro : Well, Ken, you summarized it perfectly. That's -- that one restructuring deal that we did last year, same store sales would have been up sequentially Q2 to Q3. Ken Dexter : So, that was last year? That wasn't one that just happened that is you're seeing rates deteriorate or anything? Frank Lonegro : That's correct. That\u2019s before foot and before walls. Ken Dexter : Very important clarification. Thank you. Jim Foote : Obviously we're talking merchant Intermodal right there. Ken Dexter : Okay. And then just a follow-up on -- maybe Jim, if you can detail kind of what you're doing on Intermodal. I mean, you talked about holding off until after peak, but can you walk through changes? I know you mentioned reopening or accelerating some stuff in northwest Ohio, working on the tunnel in Virginia. What is the goal on Intermodal? I don't if there's a simple way to kind of highlight what you're doing there. Jim Foote : Yes, I guess the goal is- I think we were pretty clear about last year unwinding the hub and spoke system in northwest Ohio, where you had multiple handlings of the same container on the network, which is a very expensive way to do that when you're - very expensive way to operate especially when you have short length of pull associated with that. Last year we unwound that to a large degree and we talked about the fact that we took 7% of the volume, Intermodal volumes, off the Company in the third quarter of last year.  And to be honest with you, at that point in time, we thought we had fixed the Intermodal network to a large degree. What we uncovered as we went through 2018 then and began to try and build and make our terminals more effective and our trains more efficient, that we were doing similar things to the hub and spoke in north west Ohio, we were doing that same kind of double or triple handling of containers in many other locations on the railroad. So, we are unwinding those. We got rid of, I would say, about a third of that earlier this year, before the peak. And we have another piece of business that we will unwind, rationalize the lanes, get out of doing some of this double and triple handling of containers. And that will happen at the beginning of the year, after peak season. And we'll clearly assess before we start to look into that kind of stuff, what the weather situation looks like and everything like that. Our goal here is to work with our customers. Our customers clearly understand what we're doing. And in a lot of cases it\u2019s been published not only in the media but in various analyst reports saying that what they're doing makes total sense. You can't be everything to everyone. And we\u2019re not here to win a blue ribbon for volume. We're here to win an award for being safe, customer-focused and efficient in making money. Operator : Next question comes from Thomas Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question. Thomas Wadewitz : Congratulations on the strong results. Wanted to ask a question about - you've talked about this Intermodal changes in service. You've previously, or just now, you said kind of 7-point impact of volume with what you did last year. Can you give kind of a framework of the changes you made in August this year, what you might do in first quarter next year? Is that a bigger impact? What might be the total volume impact from those changes? Frank Lonegro : So, Tom, the two announcements that we made, one, late-August and went into effect in mid-September had 2% impact on our volumes. And then the one that we announced early October, that won't take effect until early January, is about 5%. So combined, it would be about the same volume impact that we announced in, I guess, this time last year. Thomas Wadewitz : And then wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on kind of where you're at with the sales force in getting them kind of, I guess the sales force energized and the right people in place and engagement with the customers in terms of selling for the Carload customers to leverage the service and maybe convert some truck freight? And then also if you had a little more color on the BN agreement kind of what the nature is of what you're doing with BN in northwest Ohio? Thank you. Jim Foote : It's a crafty way of asking a follow-up. Thomas Wadewitz : Yes, I know, sorry about that. Jim Foote : That's okay. So clearly, what I\u2019ve been focused on here the last two-and-half months has been putting together an organization that I believe will be required going forward. So, what we believe is a truly exceptional service product. We at CSX have a lot of people in sales and marketing, over the last year and half some of those people have left the organization, some people are wearing dwell hats [ph], some people are doing some other things. So, one of my first priorities was to truly understand what I have. We just completed a couple weeks ago, a sales meeting for every sales and marketing person in the organization where we invited the entire senior management team with a lot of the senior operating folks to come together and explain to them what we're trying to achieve and what we're trying to do. Sell service, not price. Explain to them our service product that we actually have a product now to go in and sell to the customer. And we don\u2019t just throw in a plate from the head and hopefully have lowest price. So, we\u2019re doing a lot and we're focusing on creating a winning culture in our sales department. And they are incentivized as we just started a sales lieutenant program to incent them on doing what they're supposed to do and get out and sale. So, the last question? Frank Lonegro : BN. Jim Foote : BN. That\u2019s a haulage agreement beginning at the end of the month. And we're excited for that. It's -- we're going to grow into this agreement with BN. And we'll -- I think, clearly, the volumes that we will see through the end of the year will offset some of the later actualizations this year that I talked about. So, we should see some growth in Intermodal business in Q4. Thomas Wadewitz : Why would you do a haulage instead of some other way of getting the traffic there? Frank Lonegro : Again, let's say -- we're up --we took 7% off and we're up 3%. So again, we're going to take off some of this business and we're going to grow the business. Haulage is an effective way for us to work together into this northwest Ohio market. Plus, we have a long-standing relationship with the BNSF because this is exactly what we do today into the Atlanta market, the Fairburn terminal there. They have haulage from the West Coast all the way into Atlanta. So, it's consistent with the way we've done business with them for years. Operator : Your next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. You may ask your question. David Vernon : Frank, I'm trying to reconcile the acceleration in some of the demurrage fees and the incidentals with what sounds like a railroad that's running a lot faster. How should we be thinking about the point in time when those incidental fees may start to come down as customers begin to comply and what's really driving the above trend kind of result here in the third quarter on that fee line? Frank Lonegro : Yes, specifically to the quarter, it had more to do with the change in the in-transit reserve. If you think about the year-over-year change in the transit times, we\u2019re much better this quarter than we were a year ago. So, the beat against the guidance that we gave you was the revenue reserve adjustment. In terms of your broader comment, I think we're a little surprised that behaviors haven't changed as much as we had expected them to earlier in the year. I think it has less to do with our service product and more to do with the fact that trucking capacity remains tight and we've done some changes in the policies and the rates and things we thought would incent the customers to spend the assets a little bit more quickly. So, I think if trucking capacity loosens up at some point in time in the future, you could probably see that come down a little bit. But for the next quarter we've guided you to that 130 to 140 range. David Vernon : And then maybe just kind of in a related note, the $20 million step-down, is this a new normal on the equipment and other rents line or is there something also associated with the way you're setting up that haulage agreement or the in transit reserves that would affect that number as well? Should we just be thinking about this as the right run rate on equipment and other rents? Frank Lonegro : So, neither the haulage deal nor the revenue reserve adjustments have anything to do with rents. What is helping us on the rent is that the days per load for both merchandise and automotive and a little bit even on the Intermodal side have gotten so much better that we're having to pay less car hires, that's really how it translates. I'm not -- we\u2019re not going to give run rates in terms of any of the various expense line items but as our velocity continues to improve, as our dwell continues to improve, as the customers do their part of the bargain in loading and unloading, you\u2019ll continue to see days per load improve and you\u2019ll continue to see us provide efficiencies on product. Operator : Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. You may ask your question. Brandon Oglenski : So, Mark, I just want to get your perspective, now heading the marketing organization sales efforts, we talked a lot last summer about CSX service, I guess, \u201cfailing\u201d or at least that's what a lot of the industry pundits wanted to say. But how are customers engaging you today and what's the competitive outlook looking like on some of the multi-year contracts into 2019 and into 2020? Because you guys clearly have taken some costs out of the equation. From our perspective velocity is up, but how do we really measure that from a customer-service perspective? Mark Wallace : I've been spending a lot of time recently with customers. As Jim talked about, I think last quarter my number one priority was to go out there and sort of re-establish some relationships with some of these customers. And I've been doing that. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been home very much. But clearly, they have -- they are witnessing the service product that we told them that was coming. They were not too happy with us last fall, but we told them to -- we were going to improve, and we have improved, and they are witnessing that every day. Clearly, they want to keep doing business with CSX. They don't want to -- they want to move more freight to rail and to CSX rather than truck and they\u2019re doing that. We see evidence of that, especially in like our forest products business and our metals business. You'll see those double-digit growth in volumes in Q3. That is us bringing back share that those customers had to move to truck last year or early in the year because our surge levels weren't where they should have been. I\u2019ve been visiting a lot of those customers and they want to use us. And as we continue to get better and continue to improve, more and more of that freight is coming back to CSX and you'll continue to see that more in Q4 and going forward. Brandon Oglenski : I mean I guess in that context then can you just remind us the long-term volume outlook you guys provided back in February? I think it was across merchandise and Intermodal and whether maybe that could prove ultimately conservative? Jim Foote : Yes. We did not give you volume guidance. We gave you revenue guidance. Brandon Oglenski : Yes, sorry. revenue. Frank Lonegro : We\u2019re putting together our plans for 2019, as Jim mentioned, we\u2019ll provide some more color on that when we get on the January call. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Scott Group : So, Frank, can you give us maybe a little bit of guidance on real estate gains and headcount for the fourth quarter? And then big picture, I think at the analyst day over the three year plan you talked about a 6,000 reduction in headcount. Is that still the right long-term number to use? Frank Lonegro : So, in terms of year, what Jim talked about in terms of guidance is we put up the 2,000 total workforce number and we\u2019re essentially there. I think we'll continue to look for opportunities in Q4 to reduce that further. We - we'll certainly have a number internally for 2019 and beyond. Whether or not we share that, we'll certainly - we\u2019ll talk about that as we prepare for the January call. But we're going to continue even with the volume increases that we believe will come on, we're going to continue to look for labor efficiencies. You should expect that to be part of how we continue to drive operating leverage going forward. In terms of your real estate and line sell questions, we gave the $300 million three-year sales proceeds for real estate with upside in line sales. In the quarter, when you think about the split there, the gains were $43 million on line sales and $10 million on real estate. The line sales there are probably a little bit heavier on the gain side than they will be in the future, and part of the reason for that is one of the things that we characterized as a line sale was a lease conversion, so you see more gain on that one than you would in a normal line sale. So, we\u2019re off to a strong start. We've got a big pipeline. Q4 will depend on whether or not we see the things closing at the end of the year. There's always nuisances around whether something closes in December or in January. If it closes in December, we'll have a good fourth quarter. Scott Group : I guess that's helpful. And then, Mark, for you. As truckload spot pricing has softened a little bit, is that having any impact in terms of your pricing discussions as you look out to 2019 pricing? Mark Wallace : While marketing against 2019 pricing, that's having zero impact on where we are today. Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may ask your question. Justin Long : So, Jim, maybe to start with, one for you. I know you've made some changes in your coal team. I believe you've said that you're thinking big as it relates to changes, that you're contemplating for that business. Could you expand on where you stand as it relates to any structural changes you're assessing for the coal franchise and what some of those options could look like? Jim Foote : I guess the correct answer is we are always looking at what's the best way for us to be structured, and are there more efficient arrangements, structures, enterprise structures, or whatever it is, in order to maximize value. But we certainly don't have anything like that on the - in the horizon or near term. I'll let Mark follow up on the other parts of your question. Mark Wallace : Yes, as I think about - you may have seen recently we just hired a new Vice President for Coal, Shawn Yates. Shawn was a former energy trainer, former coal customer, brilliant guy. And he's coming into this role. He's been here about 30 days and he's got a lot of ideas. And so, as we think about our domestic coal business and the future of export, Shawn's bringing a lot of innovative ways and we look forward to him helping us go forward with our coal business. Justin Long : And secondly, this one's probably for Frank, on CapEx you mentioned that you pulled forward some of your spending on PTC. I just wanted to ask what drove that decision, and going forward, any change to your expectation on total CapEx for PTC or operating expense for PTC in the future? Frank Lonegro : So, no change in the overall guidance for the full PTC project. We've been saying $2.4 billion completed project for a number of years now. We're still on that trajectory with about $2.2 billion now. The decision that Jim made was if it's going be a safer railroad, let's go ahead and do everything we can to get it done more quickly. The team is fully engaged in doing that. We'll still need the extension and plan to submit our request for the extension in the next couple of months. But we're making progress there. No change in the PTC OpEx outlook. It's very consistent with what we told you in prior quarters. And yes, the overall 4.8 billion CapEx over three years is still fully intact. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Russell with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Matt Russell : Yes, just following up on CapEx. You also referenced there was a piece of the increase this year associated with hurricane relief. So, should we just assume that the very small piece of it of the overall budget of $4.8 billion is still intact for the next three years? Jim Foote : Yes. It's going be somewhere for Hurricane Florence in the 20ish million-dollar range and PTC, obviously, we\u2019re pulling some of that forward. And then we\u2019ve got some other high return projects that we have approved in the last couple of months. Obviously, with Ed, Mark, and Jim, they've got some ideas of things that can help us be more effective and more efficient and we\u2019re implementing those with some additional capital. Matt Russell : And then back to the other revenue line, is there a normalized run rate that you think about, whether we get there in 2019 or not, when you eventually do start to see those demurrage fees and customer behavior change? And what is that? And do you think that you can offset a big portion of that with improved efficiency on the network? Jim Foote : Yes. We really haven't gotten to the point where we're willing to give a long-term guide on that particular line. Just to give you some color, if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, about three quarters of the year-over-year increase is demurrage, incidentals, storage fees, et cetera, on both the carload and the Intermodal lines and about a quarter of it is that in-transit reserve that I mentioned earlier. Certainly, if we are spinning the railroad faster and faster you're going to see an offsetting decrease in your rent line because car hire is going be low. Operator : Next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC. You may ask your question. Walter Spracklin : Just starting on the volume or the revenue guidance, when we were asking you last quarter about the kind of trend there, you were a little reluctant to give any change to your formal guidance based on some of the uncertainty in coal. Just wondering if, with this change, is it that you've gotten some more visibility on coal? Or is it that the rest of the non-coal business is just ramping up that you've - with your current outlook on coal you felt the position to be able to increase your guidance? Frank Lonegro : I think that from the very beginning, each quarter I've said we were going to be I think in January, we were going be a titch better, than - slightly up. And here in the next quarter I said we were going the be a titch better than slightly up which kind of got us to, like I said, the 5% range. We've said many, many times - and now we're going up 6 to 8 - let's call it 7. 5 to 7 or 5.5 to 7. Clearly at the beginning of the year, I think everybody expected that export coal was going to tail up at the midpoint of the year. And it has stayed strong and it continues to stay strong. So yes, I mean when we had that big of a piece of our business, that has each has not declined but has steadily grown - not necessarily growing more than we expected, just everybody said it dropped off and it hasn\u2019t. So that's had a big part in the change in our outlook. Plus, as I said in my - at the very beginning, all of our business units are growing. The economy is very, very strong. All of our customers are very optimistic about the outlook. The forest products, the pulp, paper, lumber, metals, you name it, plastics, market probably you talked more customer to [indiscernible]. Jim Foote : And I think we can talk about export coal and strength of export coal all day long but what's really pleasing me these days is just the strength of our service product. Our customers are taking notice, and we're gaining market share and growing this volume on the merchandise side. We\u2019ll probably segue that. We're doing really, really well on merchandise. We're doing good in Intermodal. We announced 7% of lane rationalizations at the end of last year and we're growing Intermodal. And so, things are healthy out there. People want to do business with CSX. And somebody said north of the border last quarter it's a good time to be in the rail business. But I think it's even better time to be at CSX right now. Walter Spracklin : And similar vein here, Jim, on your operating ratio target of 60, two years ahead of schedule. You said it came in better than you expected. What area would you say really blew out the lights in terms of what you were expecting at the beginning of the year and what actually happened here three quarters through? Jim Foote : Across the board I think we're just doing - it\u2019s not just one thing that suddenly was like, oh wow, look at this. It\u2019s across the board. It was a massive reengineering at CSX. And the question was not in my mind as I said at the beginning, about a year ago, or a little less than a year ago, it was not that this company couldn't get to 60 operating ratio, it was a question of when. And so, yes, it's been from the launch talked about major, major changes on the revenue side of the business, restructuring that side of the business, getting rid of part of the Intermodal standalone business. It's a whole, whole new management team, really bright, energetic people. And then you go down to the operating side of the business. In every facet, and just every measurement that we have out there in terms of velocity, flow, train delays, crew utilization, we get down into the - I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard us talk about our [indiscernible] we've got people around these that are probably counting how many Dixie cups we\u2019re using because we are constantly focusing on improving the way we run the business and in every area we are doing better but faster than I think all of us thought we could do. Walter Spracklin : And I just want to clarify what we heard from Mark there in September. It's not that you're - you\u2019ve hit 60, now you're done. My impression from Mark was you\u2019re still early days of implementing precision railroad. So, if you hit 60, there's still plenty more to go. Is that a fair assessment? Frank Lonegro : Mark's a Canadian, so he's thinks in hockey terms. And so, Mark - Mark's still in the first period, I think in baseball terms, and we're in the early innings. We have a lot of - there\u2019s a lot of improvement to do, a lot of things to get done. And yes, there's no - I don't know where this whole idea came, but all of the sudden you hear numbers, and everybody says, oh, pivot. I\u2019ve been working really, really hard to grow this business since the day I walked in this door. And how do you grow the business, by running a better railroad. Simple as that. It's not like, oh, forget the customer, to hell with the customer and just focus on ripping our costs. That\u2019s not what precision schedule is about and that's not the way we run the business since the day I walked in here. Operator : Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Ravi Shanker : Just a couple left here. Your service levels have improved significantly, obviously, since this time last year. Can you just remind us kind of what level of SCB supervision still exists and kind of when that will lift, kind of given that you guys have proven that last year's issues no longer exist? Mark Wallace : Well, I think we weren\u2019t the only ones. When we last - like we said in March, I believe, said that we no longer had to make weekly calls with the STB. And in my - using my words, took us off the watch list. They put everybody else on the watch list. And I know that a few other railroads are still on it today. So, we're by far not - if not the best, one of the best run railroads. And so, there's no reason whatsoever that we would be under any kind of added supervision. Ravi Shanker : I guess speaking of other railroads, can you give us a little more color on this lawsuit that you filed versus your regional peer about access to the Port of Virginia? Mark Wallace : What it is, is that it's kind of a corporate governance issue where CSX and NS jointly own this third-party entity that provides switching access to the Port of Virginia. And over time, over - all things on the railroad business evolves over time into a situation where we have a representation on this company, which used to be 50/50 and we don't feel we are being provided the appropriate access to the terminals in Virginia. And we believe that that\u2019s as a result of the guys disproportionate ownership. So, we\u2019re going to defend ourselves in court. Simple as that. Ravi Shanker : If you guys do see a favorable resolution there, does that result in more kind of coal volumes or better pricing? How do we see that in the numbers? Mark Wallace : More access to the Intermodal terminals in Virginia. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Majors with Susquehanna Financial Group. You may ask your question. Matthew Majors : It's very clear that the network is running really well right now. Can you give us an update on where you are in the process of perhaps naming a permanent COO? And sort of what you guys and the board want to see before you're comfortable making that decision? Jim Foote : Chief Operating Officer? COO? Matthew Majors : Yes. Chief Operating Officer. Jim Foote : It\u2019s not on my radar at all. I\u2019ve got an extremely solid team right now that - Mark, in just one quarter, has done - I think he\u2019s doing an extremely good job and probably even better than I expected. And Mr. Harris is overseeing the operating function where we have a great talent. And so, I'm very, very comfortable with the way the company's structured today. And now that is not to say that we are not always cognitive. In fact, myself as a member of the board of directors needs to make sure that we're doing the appropriate due diligence on a succession plan. And so, that's all part of this process that we're going through in putting in. Again, Ed is working really hard and we have an extremely talented group of individuals on the operating side of the business. And on Mark's leadership, we have really a stellar group of people in the sales side of the business. So, along with Frank and the finance people, Deanna and Nathan, they\u2019re the executive leadership team, we are rock solid. People go like, hey, you're going to hire somebody? No, we\u2019re not going to hire anybody. There\u2019s nobody out there that\u2019s better than we are. Now, are we going to find who can be the future leader of the company? Yes, and hopefully we can - hopefully that comes from inside. And so, that's what we're working on to develop. Matthew Majors : Thank you for the detailed response there. Just one more really high level then I'll pass it on. If you look back for the last two quarters, CSX earned more than the prior regime did in its best full year. And it looks like you\u2019re going to end this year pretty close to the margin target you laid out the spring for 2020. You said you were exceeding your own expectations, not just ours here. I mean, all good news. But clearly, the pace that you're on this year can't continue forever. How do you think about and what do you consider when managing sort of investor expectations going forward? You keep talking to January, kind of more on January\u2019s, are we going to hear a comprehensive revisit of the long-term plan there, given the progress you've made? Or is it going be more about here's how we're looking for 2019? Jim Foote : Again, we're not planning on doing another Investor Day to reboot sort of the thing that is - there\u2019s no need to. We've got - we are nowhere near the finish line here. We've got a lot of opportunity ahead of us and we're kind of trying to - we will try to give you as much visibility towards that as we're comfortable doing at the end of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities. You may ask your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Wanted to ask about trip plan compliance because that strikes me as more of a customer-facing operating metric. And I think you indicated last quarter that trip plan compliance was around 60%. So, I was just wondering if you could update us on that metric this quarter and talk about what the upper limit is? In other words, I assume that 100% is impractical, but what's best-in-class on trip compliance? Frank Lonegro : Trip compliance, yes, I mean it's a critical component. It does two things. It measures how well the railroad is running, it measures reliability because when we fail, the truck is not going to get there when we said it was going to get there. It\u2019s simple as that. So, we say we're at 65% - 60%, 65% of the cars met their trip plans that means that 30% to 35% of them didn't. And 30% to 35% of them, we said they were going be there by Thursday at 11 :00 weren\u2019t. So that number, it's huge. And then when we miss, not only do we disappoint the customer, and not have a delivery when we said we were going to do, we then have to go back and we have to handle that car again. That means we had to - if we missed it, we have to handle it again. And therefore, the dual costs come in. So that's why this measure is so significant because it shows that hey, you didn't need to do it two or three times to get it there on time and you got it there on time. So, the customer said we did it in the most efficient manner and that's why trip plan compliance is so critical. If we're at 60% - if we were at 60%, 65%, we're in the end of the first quarter, we're up 28% or whatever the number it was I said, 26% improved from there. So, somebody do the math, high 70s kind of range right now. And we need to get that number - obviously we need to get that number to 100. What's reasonable in this kind of a business where you've got all kinds of things that go bump in the night and you have a problem occasionally. But it\u2019s not 75. It's closer to be 95. And we'll get there and we'll get there as quickly as we possibly can and if we continue to see these 10 sequentially every quarter, 10% improvement in that metric, then that\u2019s going to show how well we're doing. Cherilyn Radbourne : Very quickly just wondered if you could update us on domestic coal stockpile post the end of the summer? Jim Foote : They\u2019re a little in the center. And so, the predominance of our coal, domestic coal, utility coal is for the self, and the stockpiles are low heading into the winter here. So that's a good story for Q4, for us. And I think it\u2019s probably one of the quarter's that I've seen in a long time that I think our domestic utility goal is actually going be up in the quarter, so... Operator : Our final question comes from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. You may ask your question. Ben Hartford : Jim, just come back to beginning on the call. When you made a comment about train accident rates needing to improve. Just looking for some perspective. Your experience here relative to PSR implementation at your prior rails. Is the issue now just constructive dissatisfaction as it relates to safety and train accident specifically? Has it been weather? Or is it something else that you see kind of specific to this experience that perhaps is causing that to operate on a lag if it sort of characterize it as that metric operating on a bit of a lag? Some perspective there would be helpful. Thanks. Jim Foote : In terms of the implementation scheduled railroading on safety, if you look at the past railroads that have implemented the PSR, they\u2019ve always been the safest. It\u2019s Canadian National and then Canadian Pacific, so it is - and so it's not related to what that we've changed some kind of operating practice as a result in an issue. The vast majority of those incidents are extremely small, isolated incidents that take place in one of our yards. And they normally involve an engineering defect where something happens to the track structure, whether it's a delay - and they're all basically derailments. I think there's a few thing, one car was banging into another. But train accidents, it's mostly a derailment caused by an engineering situation or a human mistake. And so, obviously we can work on the engineering end of that, which we are aggressively, to make sure that our infrastructure and everything is up to speed in our yards with that. And then secondarily, work with our employees to make sure they understand what the rules are and make sure that they don't - don\u2019t do something with the - that causes the car to go on the ground. Simple as that. Kevin Boone : All right, that wraps up our call tonight. Jim, do you have any comments? Jim Foote : No. Thank you so much for your interest, as always, and we'll be back to talk to you at the end of the year and try to give you a little flavor for what the future looks like. Thank you so much. Kevin Boone : All right. Thanks, everyone. Operator : That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call. You may disconnect your lines.",

During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be contacting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks and introduction, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Boone, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. Kevin Boone : Thank you Shirley and good afternoon everyone. Joining me on today's call is Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Lonegro, Chief Financial Officer and Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President for Sales and Marketing. On slide two is our forward-looking disclosure and followed by non-GAAP disclosure on slide three. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim Foote : Good afternoon and thank you Kevin and thank everyone for being on the call today. What an incredible year. I would like to first recognize the amazing team of CSX railroaders. They have stepped up to the challenge again and again and put this company on a new trajectory. Success breeds success and I am proud of the foundation we have built. While we wrote an amazing first chapter, the CSX transformation story is still early. Across the organization, operations, sales and marketing and all other functions, there are plenty of opportunities for improvement to keep us busy for years to come. Millions of unnecessary events in our business processes can be eliminated which will improve service to our customers and allow them to be more efficient. We continue to make progress towards the efficiency goals set a little less than a year ago. Whether it's locomotives, cars or yards, we are finding ways to deliver better service with fewer assets. This not only saves CSX money but saves customer's money by reducing their rolling stock and other infrastructure needs. Our progress has translated to significantly more free cash flow, which allows us to maintain a safe and reliable railroad, provide the flexibility to invest in high return projects and return significant cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Turning to slide five. Results are straightforward. EPS grew 58% on an adjusted basis. Our Q4 operating ratio improved 480 basis points to 60.3%, a record fourth quarter performance. And the full year operating ratio also 60.3% is a U.S. Class I railroad record. Turning to slide six. As you can see there was broad-based strength across the portfolio. Revenue increased 10% with fuel recovery, volume, price and other revenue, all contributing to positive growth. I am encouraged to see the strong performance from our merchandise business with 10% overall revenue growth. Solid 4% volume growth helped drive positive performance across all markets with the exception of fertilizers. In fertilizers, we continued to face a headwind from the previously discussed fourth quarter 2017 customer plant closure. We also saw some weakness in the fertilizer export markets which appears transitory and should normalize in the next couple months. Intermodal revenue growth was 4% with volumes up 2%. The intermodal grew despite our previously announced rationalizations, which shows very healthy core strength. Significant progress has been made in reengineering this very important part of our business which better positions the company for long term profitable growth. Coal revenues increased 8% with strength in our export Met business offsetting domestic utility weakness. Domestic steel and industrial customers also saw good growth. Finally, similar to previous quarters, other revenue gains were primarily driven by increases in supplemental fees. On slide seven, I remain focused on safety. On a year-over-year basis, we saw good progress in both FRA personal injuries and train accidents. While it is encouraging to see some progress, the numbers are far from where I expect them to be. As of January 1, our annual bonus targets include specific safety improvement targets. Safety must be a priority for every employee in this company. On slide eight, on the efficiency and service side, train velocity saw positive year-over-year and sequential movement, while dwell improved year-over-year. Only a couple of weeks into 2019, I see positive momentum in both of these metrics with the company currently seeing record performance in both measures. Cars online continued to trend down, down over 10% year-over-year, while volume increased 3%. As you will see later, this directly translated to significantly lower car hire expense. And we periodically share with you different metrics which we track on a daily basis. On the bottom right is locomotive miles per day. This reflects the average daily mileage we are able to get out of each locomotive. Locomotives are a significant cost for the company and by reducing our active fleet we save on maintenance, fuel and capital requirements. Improvement in this metric means we need fewer locomotives to move the same amount of freight. Our active locomotive count ended the year down over 300 locomotives while we grew volume and revenue. Now let me hand it off to Frank, who will take you through the financials. Frank Lonegro : Thank you Jim and good afternoon everyone. Turning to slide 10, I will walk you through the summary income statement. As the slide shows, the impacts of tax reform, pension accounting changes and the remnants of our restructuring charges drove a significant difference between our reported and adjusted results for 2017. These adjustments impacted several line items and we have provided a full reconciliation of these items in the appendix to these materials as well as in our quarterly financial report. For year-over-year comparability, my comments will be focused on the variance to 2017's adjusted results. Total revenue was up 10% in the fourth quarter driven by a 3% increase in freight volumes with particular strength in merchandise, broad-based revenue per unit gains of 7% from higher fuel recoveries, pricing gains and a favorable traffic mix together with increased other revenue. The overall pricing environment remained strong in the quarter, supported by our improved service product, healthy freight demand levels and supportive export coal benchmarks. Consistent with prior quarters, pricing for merchandise and intermodal contracts that renewed in the fourth quarter was particularly strong. Other revenue also increased year-over-year, primarily due to increases in carload demurrage, intermodal storage and other incidental charges. These revenues are intended to offset car hire and car ownership expenses as well as the network impacts of equipment congestion. Given the STB's recent focus on accessorial and demurrage charges, we thought it was important to note that in the quarter, only a third of this line item relates to demurrage in the carload business. As we look forward, we expect the run rate for other revenue to decline slightly in 2019, excluding any liquidated damages, which we will disclose if and when they occur. Moving to expenses. Total operating expenses were 2% higher in the fourth quarter. Labor and fringe expense was relatively flat year-over-year as average employee headcount was down 6% even with 3% more volume. The company is cycling the previously reported reversal of share-based compensation for our former CEO, which favorably impacted 2017's results. Additionally, in the current quarter, we recognized railroad retirement tax refunds related to share-based compensation awards from prior years, given the industry's recent litigation win on this topic. On the operating side, year-over-year improvements in velocity, on-time originations and arrivals and trip plan compliance led to significantly fewer active trains and enabled a 10% reduction in road crew starts. Non-productive re-crews, an indicator of network fluidity, improved by 78% and have declined sequentially for five straight quarters. These favorable operating results drove a 12% year-over-year improvement in crew productivity, measured on a GTM per active train and engine employee basis. Shifting to labor. On the mechanical side, the active locomotive count was down 10% year-over-year. We continue to have over 800 locomotives in storage in addition to the hundreds of engines we have sold, scrapped or returned since the beginning of 2017. The smaller fleet, combined with lower cars online and freight car repair efficiencies, helped drive an 8% year-over-year decrease in our mechanical craft workforce. Our G&A headcount also continues to decline as we look for every opportunity to reduce our overhead costs. With respect to our total workforce, which includes management and union employees as well as contractors and consultants, we exceeded our 2018 goal of 2,000 reductions. Looking forward to 2019, improved service and operating fluidity together with opportunistic streamlining in our support functions will drive a significant year-over-year labor productivity. At a high level, we would expect our total workforce to come down in line with historical attrition rates. MS&O expense increased 3% versus the prior year. Our operations remained strong in the quarter with year-over-year service improvements driving asset efficiencies which were favorable for MS&O expense. With that said, in the quarter we did have several non-core impacts within this line. Specifically, discontinued projects resulted in asset impairments of $20 million in the quarter, an increase of $10 million year-over-year. Additionally, there was a year-to-date reclassification in Q4 that shifted certain expense credits from MS&O into other expense lines, primarily fuel. Similar to recent quarters, MS&O benefited from real estate gains which were $19 million higher than the prior year. We are continuing to monetize our surplus assets and are making good progress toward our $300 million target for cumulative real estate sales through 2020 along with the potential for upside from line sale proceeds. We continue to have a strong pipeline of real estate and line sale opportunities, though the impact of these transactions will continue to be uneven from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Looking at other expense items. Depreciation increased due to the impact of a larger net asset base. Fuel expense was up 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by a 10% increase in the per gallon price, partially offset by improved efficiency. Specifically, we utilized 1.6 million fewer gallons even with slightly higher GTMs, driving favorable fuel efficiency savings. We will drive further fuel efficiency through continued improvement in network fluidity and the increased utilization of fuel optimization processes and technologies. Equipment rents expense decreased 20% driven by significantly improved car cycle times, particularly in the merchandise and automotive segments as we continued to see strong year-over-year and sequential service improvements. Equity earnings decreased $13 million in the quarter as we are cycling a $16 million non-recurring gain recognized in the prior year by one of the company's equity affiliates. Looking below the line. Interest expense increased primarily due to the additional debt we issued this year, partially offset by a lower weighted average coupon rate. Tax expense was lower in the quarter even with significantly better pre-tax earnings, reflecting the continued benefit of tax reform. Our effective tax rate was 23.2% in the quarter, slightly lower than prior guidance, mainly due to the settling of certain state tax matters. Absent unique items, we expect our effective rate to be between 24% and 24.5% for 2019 with Q1 closer to 23.5% due to the timing of stock-based compensation payouts. As discussed at our investor conference, we also expect our cash tax rate to be up slightly, given the roll-off of bonus depreciation over time. Closing out the P&L, as Jim highlighted in his opening remarks, CSX delivered operating income of nearly $1 billion, fourth quarter record operating ratio of 60.3% and earnings per share of $1.01, representing improvements of 25%, 480 basis points and 58% respectively year-over-year. Turning to the cash side of the equation on slide 11. Adjusted operating cash flow was nearly $4.7 billion in 2018, an increase of over $1 billion or 29% year-over-year, illustrating the strength of the company's core cash generation capabilities together with the benefits of tax reform. Capital investments were down 14% or nearly $300 million, reflecting the reduced capital intensity of the scheduled railroading model. This reduction in capital intensity combined with the substantial progress this year in CSX's core operating cash flow generation drove an 88% increase in full year adjusted free cash flow. Importantly, the company converted net income to free cash flow at essentially 100% in 2018. In 2019, we expect the combined impact of revenue growth, expense control and disciplined capital investment to deliver a high free cash flow conversion rate. This significant improvement in free cash flow generation supplemented by a strong balance sheet, help support substantial shareholder returns of over $5.4 billion. We executed nearly $1.9 billion of share repurchases in the fourth quarter and earlier this week, fully completed the prior $5 billion buyback authority. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Foote : Great. Thanks so much Frank. Turning to slide 13 with a few comments about 2019. But before I talk specifically about revenue, I would like to provide some color on what we are seeing from a high level. Over the past few days, I have spoken to a number of large customers across different industries. General customer feedback has been positive and it's consistent with the demand levels we are seeing today. While it's hard to ignore the volatility in equity markets, I cannot call out any trend in our business today that would point to a significant slowdown in our business. Talking about this year, driven by merchandise strength, I expect total revenues to be up low single digits in 2019. This reflects muted overall intermodal growth, impacted by the rationalization of intermodal lanes we have talked about. Normalized intermodal growth should return in 2020. As recalled, similar to our view of coming into 2018, we expect some moderation of export coal benchmark prices in the back half of the year, but remaining at very healthy levels. As to the 2019 operating ratio, our goal is to maintain our position as the best in service and efficiency. If you look at where we finished 2018 at 60.3%, we clearly get better in a number of areas including real estate and line sales. I believe a good 2018 OR baseline to measure our improvement in 2019 is closer to 61% which adjusts for some of the better than expected benefits from real estate that occurred in 2018. I now expect CSX to outperform our previous 2020 target of 60% a full year early. This represents continued efficiency gains across our operations while leveraging the revenue growth from Mark and his team. At the Investor Day last March we guided for $8.5 billion in cumulative free cash flow over three years, including 2018 through 2020. I am happy to report we are trending ahead of that guidance. As part of our free cash flow outlook, we expect CapEx to be between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion in 2019. Finally, as you saw in the press release, we have announced a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization. As Frank said, we completed the existing $5 billion share buyback earlier than was expected. Part of our annual process will be reviewing with the Board our long term outlook for the business and discussing uses of cash and capital structure which will determine the pace at which we complete the newly authorized share buyback program. The Board's review process will take into consideration economic conditions and the company's performance against its targets as well as the current stock price to optimize long-term value for the company's shareholders. You really have to love being in the rail industry right now. So many exciting things happening. I couldn't be more proud of what we were able to achieve in 2018. It means a lot to the employees who work at CSX to be considered winners. It's great to see our mechanical employees are keeping the fleet in great shape, our engineering people that build and maintain the network and the T&E folks that get our customers' products where they need to be having this kind of success. But it does not get any easier from here. The bar is higher and it's our job to deliver. With that said, we have a team that is capable of making CSX the best railroad in North America. Thank you. Kevin? Kevin Boone : Thank you Jim. In interest of time, I would like to ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up only if necessary. Shirley, we will now take questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask you a little bit about the operating metrics and how you think they would translate to cost side performance in 2019? It seems like you have obviously put up a lot of improvement in the metrics. It sounds, Jim, like from your comments that you would expect that to continue. I am thinking the metrics we see. maybe some we don't, but velocity, dwell and so forth. Do you think that translates to further cost side improvement in 2019? Is that the right way to look at it? And then maybe I have a follow-on on the OR as well? Jim Foote : Sure Tom. Yes. I mean, we are going to continue to grind and make improvement and improve velocity. We are still long ways to go there to become consistently best-in-class. And dwell continues to improve. As we drive those two factors, that will improve our performance for our customers as well with trip plan compliance numbers increasing all the time. So it's the same metrics that we have used in the past and they will definitely continue to get better. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Great. So it sounds like there should be a translation of the cost side as well. You mentioned kind of an adjustment that you would think of on the base that we look at, like more of a 61% OR for 2018 kind of adjusted. Can you give a little more perspective of what you are adjusting out? Is that primarily land sales? Your land sale gains, are you thinking you won't have those gains? Or how do we think about that? [Indiscernible]. Jim Foote : No, Tom. We overachieved in that area and what I am saying is, if you are going to take that over achievement and kind of normalize it and say, okay, in order to move forward and say that we are going to do better than 60%, what's the good starting point? It's kind of foolish to say we are at 60.3% and say we are going to do better than 60%. So if you take out these real estate sales that were higher than what we had originally expected when we set our goal of 60% and remember, again, in 2020, for us to go forward into 2019 and to say we are going to beat that 60% 2020 target in 2019, we are just trying to put it in context for everyone that we believe we are really starting at around 61%. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. So it's primary around how we think about real estate sales. That's primarily what you are saying? Jim Foote : Yes. I think we had a number of $300 million and we had a trend on that. That doesn't mean we are going to do more than $300 million over the three years. It just means that we did better than that in 2019. And so taking that into consideration, as we look at, again, nine months ago, when we said, when we rolled this up, everybody thought we were insane people for thinking that we could hit a 60% operating ratio in three years. We are just trying to put it in context to show that we are going to do better than that and we are going to do better than that in a shorter timeframe. Tom Wadewitz : Right. Okay. Great. Thank you for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Amit Mehrotra : Hi. Thanks operator. Thanks for taking the question. So Jim, I was just hoping if you could help us parse out the company's perspective margin improvement between the volume growth that you are expecting and the significant costs opportunity that you talk about? Clearly the outlook for volumes is a bit more uncertain than where it stands today, even outside export coal in the back half, but also the cost opportunity is significant. So if you could just help us think about the net impact of those two in terms of the OR guidance that you put out in 2019. How much of that is really in your control and how much of that is now dependent on the macro environment and the volume environment? Jim Foote : Well, as we have always said, we need to have a topline growth as we move forward and our plan here is not to just merely reduce costs in order to grow the company's financial performance. So it's always been a balance as we have looked at this. That being said, as I talked earlier, on the cost side we believe that we have a lot of opportunity out there for us to continue to improve the efficiency of the network and continue to do that through many of the same practices that we have already put into place, whether it's running trains with distributed power, using other technology to reduce our fuel costs, eliminating more and more and more unnecessary touches, the way we handle our customer's products which improves throughput and improves fluidity. So it's many of those same initiatives that will drive costs further out of the company. At the same time, we are constantly focused on the topline growth both in terms of volume and price. We have, again, starting 2018, taking just a high level view at the various business segments, we started the year with intermodal which is the \"growth engine of the railroad industry\". And for a lot of reasons, as I said quite a few times, we had to reengineer that business which meant we took 7% of the volume off the railroad. Well we came out of the year with 2% up. So the 2% plus 7% means recurring about 9%, okay. So I would say, under the circumstances, pretty good. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Jim Foote : To a large degree, coal has been an issue for CSX for a while and we recognized that the domestic side of the business would be relatively stable in terms of volumes which it was and we had kind of anticipated, along with everybody else in the universe to trying to guess what's going to happen with coal, that these benchmarks for both export, met and steam coal would probably not stay at their high levels for the full 12 months, but they did until basically the very last few weeks of December. So that gave us a little bit of a better, gave us a boost there on the revenue as well, which we are seeing right now. The benchmarks are still high. The optimism right now is still strong for coal. But nobody is saying that these price levels are locked-in for sure. So it's prudent for us to say, they will probably decline somewhat but still be good in the second half of the year. Amit Mehrotra : Right. Jim Foote : And then we get over to the merchandise side of the business. The merchandise side business is the area that most benefits from the change in the operating model from the old way of looking at things and running trains and forgetting where your customers' cars were half the time on the railroad. So as we have implemented scheduled railroading and have improved the quality of our service, we are expecting, first time in a long time here at CSX, we are going to turn around this merchandise business segment which is 66% of the business and start to grow it and we are already seeing some of the business that, for a long time, went away and went to truck because we didn't have a service product that met our customer needs. So as we have done that, we fully expect to see volume growth across all of the business segments in merchandise which is the key part of this company, the heart of this company. And we are making that service product fantastic and it is something that numerous recent reports have highlighted from the customer base that they are very excited about the new attitude, the new way we do business and the service product that we offer. Mark, do you want to add anything else? Again, I guess I talked plenty there. [Indiscernible]. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Let me just ask one very quick follow-up, if I could. Jim, you talk about the best run railroad in North America. I just want to understand what that actually means. Does that translate to the best operating ratio in North America that accompanies the best service levels in North America? And then if you could just tie that into kind of the 2020 target because it doesn't seem like that has changed unless I am reading too much in the language. Does it seem the 2020 target has changed? Is that just too far out for you right now? Or is there something where you are thinking 60% is really kind of the high watermark for the network? Jim Foote : Okay. Well first of all, as I said, what does the best railroad in North America means? First and foremost, the safest. Second, providing the best service possible to the customers and the best service recognized by the customer base as being had at above everybody else in the industry and doing that in the most efficient manner. And the most efficient manner one could look at, one way to measure that in the way that it's commonly measured is by looking at the company's operating ratio. As I have said and as we said in the press release, we had a 60.3% operating ratio this year. That is the best ever in the history of a North American railroad. We are ahead of the CN and the CP who have been at this for 15 or 20 years and we are ahead of these guys and we plan to stay ahead of those guys. We have an operating ratio that was going to be 60% in two years from now. What we are saying is, we are going to have an operating ratio that is better than 60% this year. So it's not the same, not at all. It is a dramatic and significant improvement in our efficiency and performance. A full year ahead of where we said we were going to be. And as I said, when we said it nine months ago in New York, everybody said we were crazy, it can't be done. Amit Mehrotra : All right. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. You may ask your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hi guys. Well, I guess following along that line of questioning. Jim or Mark, can you talk more about the lane rationalization that you have had on the intermodal business? I think you highlighted it a little bit last quarter that it was about optimizing with some of your interchange partners from the West. But maybe if you could elaborate on that? And how much, again, headwind that could represent in 2019? Mark Wallace : Sure. So let me just repeat briefly so everyone understands what we did in 2017. As Jim just mentioned, at the end of the year 2017 when we began this journey of fixing our intermodal business and getting away from what we thought was a broken hub and spoke model, the impacts to those changes that we made then had an impact of about 7% of our intermodal business. As Jim just said, despite that, we grew our intermodal volumes last year 2%. In the middle of last year, as we continued working through a lot of the changes that we made over the course of the year, we decided to do another round of rationalizations, changes that impacted as of October 1, another 3% of the business those took effect and we announced as well as other changes that took effect this year on January 3, impacting roughly another 5%. And as Jim just said, for 2019, we think we are going to be flattish to hopefully slightly up for the year on volumes. We have been going through this for some time now. You have probably seen some reports from some of our customers who actually agree with what we are trying to achieve. Clearly, we are competing in the lanes where we think we can do a better job of serving them. We are doing really well. We had a great peak season this past fall and into Christmas and we are doing so at lower cost. We got away from, as I said, the traditional hub-and-spoke. And so the switching and the lifting and all the crazy stuff that we have been doing previously that were driving down the profitability of that business segment is improving substantially and we are not done. We still got a ways to go, but we are pleased with the progress that we have made so far in that area. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. Appreciate that, Mark and if I can just sneak one in here. I think Frank mentioned that you would expect headcount would be down with natural attrition this year. So can you put some context around that for us? Frank Lonegro : Yes. So a couple of things on that one. Better service obviously requires less folks to run the railroad. Less assets come from better service and less people to maintain those assets. And then certainly on the G&A side, as we have attrition opportunities, we will take those. As you think about our historical attrition levels, we are thinking about going to 6% to 7% from a total workforce perspective. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. You may ask your question. Chris Wetherbee : Yes. Great. Thanks. I wanted to come back to the OR for a second. So I just wanted to get a sense that you are going to exceed the 2020 target in 2019. What do you think the potential of the business is as you look out a little beyond 2019, say 2020 or 2021? Jim Foote : I think that in terms of the specific place where the operating ratio should be, as we move into the future, whether it's a year, whether it's five years from now, wherever it is, we will find the right spot where that operating ratio should be that it allows us to provide the most efficient, highest quality of service but grow the business at optimal levels. So there isn't a magic point where you say, oh, this is necessarily where I am trying to get to. We are trying to put the three elements there of service, efficiency and growth together and find the optimum spot and we will start to search for that in the future. At the same time, I can tell you that, at least in my opinion, you will always want to be the most efficient in the marketplace. No matter what the line of business you are in, no matter what you are making, no matter what you are selling, normally if you are doing it the best, you are going to be the most successful. So that's my number one reason for wanting to continue to drive on continuous improvement and continue to make all these changes because it continues to make us the best in the marketplace and the best in the industry. And I think that should be a goal of any organization. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That's fair. That's helpful. And then I also just want to touch on the intermodal outlook. I wanted to make sure I am clear on what you guys think volumes might be in 2019. It sounds like maybe down or flattish a little bit in that segment? And then where are you in that process? You have done some of the rationalization with the repairs. But I am just kind of curious how you think about how much more wood there is to chop on the intermodal segment specifically? Mark Wallace : Yes. As I just said a couple of minutes ago, we just announced another round of rationalizations took effect on January 3 this year. Those are obviously working with our customers as they work through all those. I don't foresee and I don't anticipate any other significant announcements in intermodal changes anytime soon. I hope we don't have to do anymore. I think we are getting the network down to a manageable area where we can really focus on the lanes, where we can really compete and deliver superior service. So we are focused on that. We are driving hard. As I just said, yes, we are going to overcome the loss of the rationalizations as we did in 2018, hopefully in 2019 as well. And so yes, I would be disappointed if our volumes were down and I am looking and I am pushing that we make that up and maybe do a little bit better. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Thanks for very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Allison Landry : Thanks. So obviously you guys did a really good job on the service metrics overall. But I was a little surprised to see the on-time arrivals kick down sequentially. I think that's a pretty important metric that you focus on. So is there something specific during the quarter that drove that? Or was that where you thought it would be? And what has to happen for that to improve to the point where you can create the slots for intermodal and drive incremental volume growth? Jim Foote : Hi, Allison. Yes. We were clearly disappointed with that metric during this quarter and worked extremely hard on that. Both originations on-time and arrivals were clearly not where they need to be. How do you get them better? You execute. The train is supposed to depart on schedule so that it can arrive at the next terminal. So that the assets and the crew and everything are balanced as we run around our network. It needs to get out of the terminal on time. And then, there can't be an event en route that causes it to experience a delay so that it doest arrive in the destination terminal where it needs to on-time. And so it's just execution. It's constantly looking at all of the root causes of what caused the failure en route. So, is it a mechanical issue, do we need to, are we focusing on, what causes the engines to fail? Are there systemic issues that caused the locomotives to fail, which causes the train not to get across the river? Are there mechanical issues? Are there engineering issues that we need to address? Are there crew balancing issues that we need to address? So it is all of those various elements in the way you run the railroad that you need to focus on in order to get those numbers up. I can tell you that the on-time origins and arrivals in our most recent numbers have been, I certainly hope that we can maintain this and don't get whacked with a bunch of crazy snowstorms, but are significantly better than where they were in the fourth quarter. Allison Landry : Okay. And if I think about that improving all that the things that you talked about, is that what we should be watching in terms of a metric to sort of think about, okay, this is maybe the point where the intermodal business can start to see incremental volume growth from maybe the guidance that you guys talked about? Frank Lonegro : Well, yes, I will let Mark add onto this. But again, incremental volume growth in the intermodal business, when we take 7% of the volume off the railroad intentionally every year because we shouldn't be doing that kind of work in order to fix the company and we grow 2% or we come in maybe this year flat to slightly up and our goal in the business here, 7%, 8%, 9% a year in intermodal. So that's a good environment for us to be trying to reverse and improve the overall core product of the intermodal business. We are not just driving off just to get rid of bad business. We are fixing and improving the intermodal franchise and the intermodal network of the CSX so that it can grow and grow and grow and grow profitably consistently in the future. Mark? Mark Wallace : And I think Allison, one thing under scheduled railroading that we have talked about a lot historically and the Canadians talked about a lot, we are focused on here as well, trip plan compliance. Trip plan compliance is what the customer experiences. When the train departs in the terminal and when it arrives is one measure, but what the customer experiences is, did we hit the committed to trip plan for his or her container or intermodal. That's something that we are intensely focused on CSX right now and we will be rolling that out to customers this year and that's our product. That's what we sell to our customers is meeting their trip plans and the commitments that we make to them on when we are going to deliver their goods. Allison Landry : Got it. Thank you for the time. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So I want to go back to the export coal outlook embedded in the 2019 guidance. What are you thinking in terms of the range of assumptions specifically for volume and the mix of thermal and met? You had a pretty good year as did the market for thermal last year. Do you think that moderates? And I know you have said that basically the back half of the year is going to see some softness on the pricing, but what about the first quarter? I would imagine that's reasonably well spoken for at this point. Can you give us some color as to how that's shaping up, first quarter of 2019? Mark Wallace : Sure. So 2018, I think it was the second highest export coal year that this company has ever done. Somewhere around 43 million tons. We expect similar low-40s in 2019. Hopefully we are able to match our performance in 2018. But the mix is 65% met, 35% thermal. That hasn't changed. I should say that of our export coal for 2019, we have about 65% of our contracts are already locked up and the team is working hard to get that to a 100%. So we see a very good demand environment and the benchmarks are where the benchmarks are and there is a forward curve. Who knows where that's going to go. It bounced around like crazy in 2018. We are not sure exactly what's going to happen but we have made reasonable assumptions in our plan for 2019 which I think, as I said, are reasonable. And again, as long as we can get the coal out of the ground and get it to the port, I think we will have a very good export coal year. Brian Ossenbeck : Thanks Mark. A follow-up on that. The 65% of contracts, can you just put some more context around that? Is that spoken for volume tied to a benchmark? And is that any different in this cycle versus the last one, as clearly [indiscernible]. Jim Foote : Yes. So it was 65%, sorry. I don't want to go into the specifics of our contracts, but some of them are tied to the various benchmarks. So pricing goes up and down, collars, et cetera, et cetera. But the 65% is significantly higher than where we were at this time last year. So this time last year, we were low in terms of contracts signed up and we have started the year really good there. So that's just a reflection of the demand and that our customers want to lock these contracts up soon. So we are very happy with that. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. And then just be clear, those are volume commitments or some are actually performing? Jim Foote : Correct. Yes. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. All right. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. So you may ask your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good afternoon. So, wanted to ask about your expectation for gains on the sale this year. I know it's hard to predict. But just curious if you have any initial thoughts on what this year looks like versus 2018? And then also on equipment, you referenced the reductions you have seen in cars online and locomotives. Can you share with us what your expectation for the reduction in 2019 is, if you have those numbers? Frank Lonegro : Hi Justin, it's Frank. In terms of the real estate, as Jim mentioned in his remarks, we did have an extremely good 2018. We still have a good pipeline for 2019, perhaps not as good as 2018. But you should expect some choppiness quarter-by-quarter in 2019 on real estate. On the line sales, in 2018 we did have line sales that had both cash and gain impact. It's a little unusual to have the gain impacts on line sales. Those were lease conversions that drove some operating income favorability. In terms of 2019, we do have a couple of lines sales in the work. They will be cash accretive but not necessarily operating income accretive. In terms of your equipment question, yes, we had a great run in 2018 both in terms of engines and in terms of cars. We will continue as service improves and depending on the volume elements of things, we will continue to see less equipment in service in 2019. We don't have specific targets around that. Obviously a lot of that's going to be dependent on our achievement of service levels and the volumes that come onboard. But you should continue to see us run a better railroad, a more efficient railroad, a safer railroad and continue to drive long term profitable and sustainable growth. Justin Long : Okay. Great. I will leave it at that. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Matt Reustle : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. One on the intermodal business. As you get past the rationalization and you return to those normalized growth rates in 2020, what should we expect those normalized growth rates to look like? Is this a segment that you would expect to be the fastest growing in the business? Jim Foote : We hope so. At better profitability that would be very, again, we took off 7%, it grew too in 2018, so 9%. It all depends on state of the economy, the demand. You have all the things working in your favor. But certainly, it should be healthy, it should grow at a healthy clip. A couple of points above GDP hopefully, if not more, at better profitability. Matt Reustle : Great. That's helpful. And then just one more. In terms of the CapEx budget, it seems like you are trending above the three year $4.8 billion target. Are you pulling forward any CapEx? Are you spending more as you generate more? What's driving the trend? Or should we expect a major step down in 2020 to ultimately get to that target? Frank Lonegro : Yes, a good question. In 2018 we did pull some stuff forward. We did have an acceleration of PTC. Jim wanted to get that done as quickly as possible. From a safety perspective, it makes all the sense in the world. We had some hurricane damage obviously in 2018 that we had to take care off. And then we had a couple of high return projects that got involved and wanted to look at certain things that could help improve on the maintenance side, especially on locomotives. 2019, we gave you a range there to give ourselves some flexibility on projects that may or may not come to fruition, as we look across both the commercial side and the operating side of the business. We are going to hopefully finish up positive train control and most of the spending in 2019. So we ought to see at least that element of step down as we get into 2020. But then again, every year is going to be a little bit different. We are going to look at the free cash flow. We are going to look at the opportunities to generate returns on those projects. So we will give you 2020 guidance as we get out much further into 2019. Matt Reustle : Okay. Great. Thanks for the questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Scott Group : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon guys. So Frank, I just wanted to ask you a couple of small little guidance things. One, can you give us some color on equity earnings line for 2019? And then I think you said other revenue maybe a little bit lower, but maybe what's a good quarterly run rate for that line? Frank Lonegro : Yes. So let's do your equity earnings one first. I think if you plug in somewhere in the $20 million to $25 million benefit a quarter in your 2019, you will probably end in good shape. This year was $96 million in total. I think you are going to see roughly that same amount, as you think about 2019. In terms of other revenue, yes, I did say it's going to be a tad lower from a run rate perspective. This year the number was $582 million. We have $28 million of liquidated damages. So back that one out and then get a little bit lower on your run rate there. I am not going to give you a quarterly run rate number, but if you take the $28 million off and then back out a little bit more you will be in the right neighborhood. Scott Group : Okay. Helpful. And then Jim I understand your point about, you have got to figure out exactly what the optimal operating ratio is where you can still grow. So you are not ready to give a number, but is there a reason why that optimal OR couldn't be in the mid-50s? I mean there's still obviously more to go, headcount, the intermodal network changes, we haven't seen the full impact there yet. Could we be talking about a mid-50s OR as the optimal OR at some point in the future? Jim Foote : Well, sure, Scott. There's no reason in the world that we look at where we are today as far as we come and where we are positioned in the railroad industry today. And you can't make this stuff up when we find that we need to fix it every single day, opportunity after opportunity after opportunity. And I know that it sounds crazy when we said, we don't think we are anywhere near where we can get. So it's not inconceivable that mid-50s is something that someday might happen. But it's not like that is the quest. The quest is to get as efficient in best places as we possibly can be so we can grow the business. Scott Group : Makes sense. Okay. Thank you for the time guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Ken Hoexter : Hi Jim, Mark, Frank and team, congrats on the OR. Just, Jim, you noted you are not seeing economic weakness. So I just want to dig inside for a second. Intermodal pricing slipped to about 2.5% from 9% growth. Is that from just the loser truck environment? Is that a shift in mix? Any thoughts on pricing at intermodal? Jim Foote : Well, pricing at intermodal was clearly the markets going into the peak season were tight. And they have been tight for a long time due to the driver situation and the electronic reporting. So it took a while for that to work out. So I think that the truck market clearly, in terms of the spot pricing, has declined. Now, in our case, as I have said before, we don't chase that spot market. Our contracts, our arrangements with our customers, our channel partners is much more of a longer term. We guarantee we provide a longer term service, a partnership arrangement with the intermodal people and they make commitments, they make investments, they buy containers, they do a lot of things in order to be able to grow their intermodal franchise with us. So it's not like, oh my God, look at this is up, that is up, that sort of thing. So that is the more recent view of the marketplace in terms of pricing. In terms of the overall economy and are we seeing changes in the economy that would prohibit or limit intermodal growth, I could say, as I said earlier in my remarks, we look at every economic indicator possible to try and understand what the economy is. And we talk to our customers, which touch every segment of the U.S. economy and especially in intermodal where they move from auto parts to technicians. And so we believe that we have a very good feel and sense for what's going on in the economy. However over the last couple of months, everybody, not only us, but when we talk to our customers, we are talking about headline news about trade, tariffs, interest rate, what's going on with Brexit, government turbulence, al of these things that everybody swirling around that must have a solid impact on the way you run the business. So we all go back and we look in the crystal ball really deeper and we try to determine what's going on and we go back to the same place we were a few months ago. Everybody, us and our customers, are still very optimistic about the business in 2019 and not necessarily on the intermodal side business, but on the merchandise side of the business, we have customers who are making the long term capital investments where they are going to be building and expanding their facilities over into 2019 and 2020. And none of those projects are being pulled back. So we feel very good about where we are right now especially given the fact that we are dramatically improving the quality of our service and are just not sitting here with a transportation product that's viewed as a commodity, that we just sell into the marketplace based on price. And the customer decides, I will go with truck or I will go with railroad, whoever gives me the lowest price. We are providing them with a valuable service and changing the dynamics and we are starting to get business from truck that historically moved on rail that's now coming back because of the changes that we have made. Ken Hoexter : It's helpful. Jim Foote : So it's a good time. And as I said, it's a great time to be in the railroad business. Ken Hoexter : Yes. I appreciate it. It just seemed odd to see the deceleration of pricing in intermodal. But let me just ask a quick follow-up. You mentioned the work of or I guess, we have seen a lot of the peers adopting precision railroading or I guess the final two big ones on the Class I side. Any impacts that you have seen on service interchange? You always talk about if the industry gets better, it's better for everybody. Have you seen impacts to service as the other carriers start launching into that? Jim Foote : Well, first, yes, I would reiterate, yes. I mean to the extent that all the railroads run better, we are a network. So if everybody's running better, it's better for the individual companies. I am unaware of any kind of interchange issues that we are experiencing that would be, let's say, attributed to somebody changing their business model. Clearly, day of the week, couple of days here and there due to snow in Chicago or something like that, yes, everybody gets slowed down, yes. But nothing unusual. Mark Wallace : Hi Ken. Just to alleviate maybe some of your concerns with respect to the intermodal issue in Q4. Don't be concerned. You are always going to have a little bit of noise in there. We did see some impact with respect to the lane rationalizations. We are seeing and experiencing some really good pricing renewals from channel partners on the private asset side. And the spot market rates don't really have too much of an effect, 90% of our intermodal business is not impacted by the spot market. Most of our contracts are multi-year. We have seen recently there are all kinds of talk in the industry about what's going to happen to the spot market. Nobody really knows. There has been a little bit of softening, but I don't think we are too concerned about it at this point in time. Ken Hoexter : Thanks for the follow-up. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. You may ask your question. Ben Hartford : Yes. Thanks. Frank, just to clarify on the OR target for 2019 now. The previous 2020 target was 60%. So that does assume some sort of normalized. You talked about choppiness and gains here in 2019. That does include gains to some degree, right? That's not a complete ex-gains number, that 60% that you are talking about? Frank Lonegro : Yes. So sub-60% for 2019 is obviously the message that Jim is sending and it's a reported number. So yes, it would include some level of real estate gains. Ben Hartford : Okay. That's good. And then the share repurchase authorization, when does the schedule expire? Frank Lonegro : It doesn't have an expiration. But certainly, we wanted to make sure we had the authority and the capability to be in the market when the window opens. We exhausted the prior program early, which is why we are announcing it on this call. Normally, it would have been a little bit later in the year in connection with the capital structure conversation that Jim mentioned in his remarks. Ben Hartford : Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC. You may ask your question. Walter Spracklin : Yes. Thanks very much. I got one question on the OR and one question on volumes. On the OR, I guess Jim, when PI service first contemplated at CSX, it was a significant opportunity and I think you executed on that in 2017 with upwards of 400 basis points of improvement. 2018, almost 600 basis points. I am just getting now, I am hearing you say there's still tons of room for early innings, lot more to go, but I am getting the indication that that's going to slow significantly. Am I reading that right? Is the trajectory now of the 55% OR now far, far down in the future that it's something that will come and really we are going to block and tackle from this point going forward, a 100 basis point per year here, a 100 basis point per year there? Am I hearing you right on that? Jim Foote : Well, I think that as I said, Walter, you have been following this longer than anybody, probably because you started with me, with us. And yes, as you get further down the road, it becomes harder. CN and CP have been doing it for a long time and have been recognized to be the greatest of all time and are still considered by some to be phenomenal, because they can take a point out a year after doing this for 15 years. We are beating them and we are saying we are going to get better next year, below 60% off of a 61%. So I am pretty confident and pretty comfortable that we are clearly not just sitting back and taking it easy. It just gets harder. And so I don't think anybody at this level can look you square in the eye and say, yes, let's take another 600 basis points out of the current this year. Walter Spracklin : Right. So when do you -- Jim Foote : It is growing it up Walter Spracklin : And Jim, you mentioned CN and CP. And PSR has been used as a cost driver and you have used it very much successfully there. But in prior incident or prior iterations, it then turned into a revenue driver, where PSR could then be used to gain share, to gain traction, be it from truck, from your rail competitor. You are guiding it kind of flat to slightly up volume growth this year. When do you really see an inflection, where you can turn around and take PSR and use it the way the other PSR players have done and really drive revenue growth? Jim Foote : Well, in my opinion and I have said this many times for years and years and years, the reason that my opinion as it becomes a point in time when all of a sudden you start to see above average growth for a railroad company that's adopted this, is because of the quality of the service becomes so much better than it historically was. Again, it's not like some people say, oh, all of a sudden you get to some point in time, June 22, 2020 and you go, oh, we are going to pivot from cost reduction to growth. It is an evolutionary process that as you continue to focus on getting your trains to run on time as efficiently as possible, it improves the quality of the service and that customers can put more, because we become more reliable, they will put more business on it. So it's an evolutionary process. And yes, that's what we, Mark and I and everyone here now who have seen the benefits of this transformation recognize that the customers are actually starting to like us for the first time in a long time. And so we are going to continue to grow. That doesn't mean we are all of sudden going to say, okay, 60.3% is it. We are not going to get any lower. No, we are going to continue to believe that each and every year, we can continue to improve the efficiency of the network that again, it improves the profitability of the company, but it improves the quality of the service to the customer. So it's an ongoing continuous improvement initiative that hopefully will go on as long here as it has at CN and now CP. Walter Spracklin : Excellent. Thanks for the insight, Jim. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question. David Vernon : Hi. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the time. Jim, I want to ask a question on the regulatory and then just a quick follow-up on CapEx. First, the STB poking around accessorial fees, can you give us a sense for how that is expected to play out? Is there any timetable for that review? And do you see any risk to the industry from seeing some of those fees maybe called back? Jim Foote : I don't know that there's any kind of formal process with time stamp. I just think that the Chairman reached out to the railroads and wants to know more about it. And we have responded and provided a great amount of detail. And none of these issues, whether it's demurrage or any of these things, is new. These things have been on the books for years and years and years. They are kind of industry practices in transportation. So I don't think there's any issue. And you also have to remember that these are public tariff situations. The vast, vast majority of our contracts or services are privately negotiated and have been since 1980 when we were deregulated and when we sign a contract with a customer and it says, you will be governed by our tariffs. So it's a very, very small percentage of the business that the customers already have not agreed to as being fair and just. David Vernon : So there is no formal case that's been opened or docket that's been open for them to [indiscernible]? Jim Foote : No. Again, I think this is just the Chairman doing her job. She heard like you know in the media or wherever, maybe that one of those public trains magazine or something like that, she read an article that something nefarious was going on and they were reporting at. And she said, well, I am going to check it out. She said, tell me what's going on. David Vernon : Maybe that interview with Matt Rose the other day. Second is --? Jim Foote : I didn't say that. David Vernon : Not sure if you want to comment on that one, but that one would obviously be welcome to your comment. But as a follow-up, I have question on the CapEx and the Baltimore tunnel project. I read some stuff and the industry ragged about that maybe coming back to life. Could you talk a little bit about kind of what that looks like from a capital commitment standpoint and whether or not that thing come back to life from a planning perspective for you guys? Jim Foote : Well, about a year ago, maybe you will remember I went out just about a year ago, I went out and met with the Maryland delegation because Hunter had said, we would not participate in the project. And I went out there a year ago and I just said well, give me some time to look at this and figure out what it is, what's going on with this tunnel, why are we spending all these hundreds of millions of dollars for a tunnel under the city of Baltimore. And so we studied it. We looked at it for a long time. And we went back and said to the Maryland delegation, I did, again just before Christmas and said, we have looked at it. The economics are such that there would be justification for us to participate, but at a lower level than had been previously committed to. The lower level being, we believe that there's a sufficient return on investment to CSX, if we put in around $91 million. I think that's like $50 million or so less than what we had previously said we would participate at. The Maryland delegation, I think, it's in my opinion, was pleased that we did what we said that we were going to do and they are trying to figure out if they could find other funding mechanisms to make up the difference. And if they can find other funding mechanisms, then maybe this project goes forward. It is viewed as a tremendous opportunity to the city of Baltimore and the state of Maryland and we are trying to participate and work with them as best we can. David Vernon : But no hard data or anything like that, right? Frank Lonegro : There's nothing in the 2019 capital number that Jim and I talked about relating to the Howard Street Tunnel. David Vernon : All right. Thanks very much guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. You may ask your question. Bascome Majors : Yes. Thanks for taking my question here. This summer you changed the operating structure of the railroad to a more regional one with more responsibility under the people in those regions. And it sounds like there may have been some turnover in that senior team since then. I was just curious, are you happy with the new structure and the results it's producing? And may be longer term, either Ed or Jim, could you discuss your thoughts on the bench strength and when you might name a permanent Chief Operating Officer? Thanks. Jim Foote : Yes. We are very happy, I think, with the structure. It's a structure that we are comfortable with, I am comfortable with, Ed is comfortable with because that's the way we structured the railroad at CN, driving the accountability and responsibility down to the line supervisors and the front line supervisors to make the day-to-day decisions and our experience is that the railroad runs better that way. So far, that's exactly what we are seeing. But we will continue to refine it. We will continue to improve it. At least as the employees tell me, they like it, because they get to make decisions and they don't have to pick up the phone and call somebody in Jacksonville and ask if it's okay to take a switch engine off. They get to make decisions on the fly in order to make the railroad run better each and every day. In terms of naming someone to, I guess become head of the operating department, let's call it that, we don't have a specific timeframe. Ed and I are working on that along with our human resource people to come up with a plan and the Board, because it's important for the Board too, I would say to get somebody in there as quick as possible. But we are not going to rush forward and do something rash. We are assessing all of our talent internally and if appropriate, we will look elsewhere. But, we got a lot of great people here that can probably step up into that role. And then one of Ed's responsibilities when I asked him to come and help me was to help me choose that, find that person, work with that person and train that person so that they can be the best. And there's nothing that's changed there. You know maybe we will get it done this year, I don't know. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good evening everyone. Just one follow-up on the guidance. Did you say a flat to slightly up volume growth on the intermodal side? Or just overall volume growth? Or both? Jim Foote : What I said was that with the lane rationalizations that we announced in October and then ones that we implemented January 3 of this year is about another 8%. We would look to make that up. And if we are flat, that's great. If we are up slightly on volume, that's even better. Ravi Shanker : Great. It sounds like that's an intermodal comment. Can you just help unpack your full year revenue guidance in terms of volume mix and maybe some other components, because if I look at low single digit revenue growth, I am assuming you guys get at least 3% price which doesn't leave much room for volume or mix growth there, even if you adjust for the fuel surcharge headwind. So can you just tell us what you are expecting in terms of overall volume growth for 2019? Jim Foote : I don't think we gave any volume growth for 2019 other than, as Mark anecdotally said in his comments here related to volume growth on the intermodal side that we hope that we will see flat, again because we took 8% of the volume off again, flat. And if Mark being the marketing czar that he is, is able to achieve success, he will grow it, again like he did this year. And so the low single digit number is in relation to revenue growth in 2019. Frank Lonegro : And remember, Ravi, you got fuel price moderating. So you are not going to get the fuel surcharge uptick that you saw this year. And then as you heard me answer, I think Scott's question around the supplemental line, that's coming down. So, you have got more help from the volume and the pricing side than what that low single digit might imply. Ravi Shanker : Okay. Got it. And just as a follow-up, I think as it was alluded to earlier, there are a couple of U.S. rails left that are potentially going down the PSR path, one of which is your regional competitor. If they do something significant and they do see service disruption as a result of that and there's volume that comes your way, are you willing and able to take that just given the right focus that you have on price and margin over volumes? Jim Foote : Listen, we are trying to grow the business. That's what we keep saying over and over here. And you know we can grow the business with price and improving margins. And we are open for business. Frank Lonegro : We have ample capacity, line of road, equipment, people, we are good to go. When they want to bring it over, we are ready. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. You may ask your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I just wanted to ask, in terms of your safety goals, I am wondering if you could give us a high level idea of some of the areas where you would like to see improvement in 2019 and how that ties back into the cost equation? Jim Foote : Well, the goals are pretty clear. FRA personal injuries and FRA reportable accident. So there's complete transparency and no ambiguity in terms of what we are trying to do. From a cost savings perspective, they have put a dollar amount on personal injury. My goal and I have told everybody here since I walked in the door here is, I don't want anybody to ever get hurt here. And so you will see that our numbers, at least from a personal injury standpoint, have improved and come down dramatically. On the FRA reportable accident/derailments, wow, there's a huge amount of money we could save if we can get that number down, huge. But again, that's not necessarily the sole motivation. Every one of those, in my opinion, every one of those accidents where we derail, where we corner the car or we kick the car down the wrong track and it derails or something like that. In my opinion, every one of those incidents means somebody could have got hurt. And so we have got to stop doing that and we have got to stop wrecking things. But on that accident side, it could directly answer your question, there would be a big pot of money there if we can improve that number. Ravi Shanker : Thank you. That's all from me. Jim Foote : Great. Thanks so much. Kevin? Kevin Boone : Yes. I think we are done. Thank you everybody for joining the call. If you have any question, please reach out. Operator : This does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call. You may disconnect your line.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the CSX Corporation First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be contacting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Slater, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. Sir, you may go ahead. Bill Slater : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today\u2019s call is Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Lonegro, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. James Foote : Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us today. As you know, Kevin Boone is taking on new responsibilities, and I\u2019d first like to thank him for the great job he did in leading our Investor Relations effort and for helping me directly over the last 15 months. We are happy that Bill Slater decided to join CSX, and with his experience on the buy side and in private equity, he will be a great addition to the team. As for the quarter, solid performance across many measures produced both record financial results and record service. I want to thank all of the CSX employees, especially those in the field for their hard work and keeping the railroad running on time during difficult weather condition. Despite the challenging condition, CSX set new records in Q1 for just about every service metric. While we are all proud of these accomplishments, nobody is resting on their success. I\u2019d also like to add a little more detail on the recent appointment of Kevin to Vice President of Marketing and Strategy, and Arthur Adams to Vice President of Sales and Customer Engagement. Both report to Mark in the expanded sales and marketing organization and are part of the continuing effort to build a highly-skilled team focused on finding creative ways to address our customers\u2019 key transportation needs and drive profitable sustained growth. Kevin will develop and lead a group focused on utilizing deep research and analytics to identify and advance new business opportunity and high-priority growth initiatives across our merchandise markets. Arthur, who is our Head of Marketing Services, is lead \u2013 is leading the transformation of customer service operations and e-solutions in addition to directing our TRANSFLO operations, and he is adding an expanded team targeting small and medium-sized customers to his responsibility. His initial area of focus will also be the Merchandise segment. Both Kevin and Arthur will do a great job for us and ultimately our shareholders. Now, let\u2019s get to the presentation, Slide 5, and start with our results. The results are once again straightforward with only a few small unique items that Frank will point out. First quarter EPS increased 31% to $1.02 versus last year\u2019s figure of $0.78. Our Q1 operating ratio improved by 420 basis points to 59.5%, a new first quarter record for the company. Turning to Slide 6, you can see there was broad strength across our merchandise and coal businesses, partially offset by the impact of changes in certain intermodal business segments. Our top line increased 5% to over $3 billion. Merchandise volumes, pricing, other revenue and fuel recovery, all contributed to growth. I\u2019m encouraged by the strong performance of our merchandise business with 6% overall revenue growth. Merchandise volume growth of 3% is the result of positive growth across every market with the exception of fertilizer, which was slower primarily due to the impact of difficult weather conditions, which delayed spring applications. The continuing turnaround in our merchandise business is without a doubt the result of our improved service levels. Despite continued growth in the International segment, intermodal revenue declined by 5% on 5% lower volumes due to the additional lane rationalizations implemented following peak season. Coal revenue increased 7% as strength in domestic steel and industrial markets, combined with growth in export coal more than offset domestic utility declines. Finally, growth in other revenue is primarily the result of a settlement of a customer contract dispute. Excluding this impact, other revenue would have been flat versus last year. On Slide 7, let\u2019s review our safety performance. The safety of our employees remains my top priority and we are getting better. As you can see in the charts, we achieved significant reductions in FRA personal injuries and train accidents, both sequentially and year-over-year. While this progress is encouraging and we may be the best in the industry this year, I can tell you that we will never be satisfied with our performance, if one of our employees gets injured or killed while at work. It is just unacceptable. Turning to Slide 8, let\u2019s take a quick look at just a few examples of the areas of improved operating performance. On the service side, velocity and dwell, both improved sequentially and year-over-year to reach new record levels for the company, and our more fluid network allows us to get more out of our assets and increase efficiency. In total, relative to the first quarter, we reduced the number of cars online 10% and gross ton-miles per available horsepower improved 9%. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Frank, who\u2019ll take you through the financials. Frank Lonegro : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, I\u2019ll walk you through the highlights of the summary income statement. As Jim mentioned, total revenue was up 5% in the first quarter, driven by strong pricing gains, favorable traffic mix, increased other revenue and higher fuel recoveries. Moving to expenses. Total operating expenses were 2% lower in the first quarter. Labor and fringe expense was down 3%, as average employee headcount was 5% lower on volume similar to last year. Continued refinement of the operating plan and our ongoing focus on trip plan compliance led to year-over-year improvements in velocity and on-time arrivals. CSX operated significantly fewer active trains at higher-performance levels leading to reduced road crew starts and savings in ancillary crew costs, such as crew balancing expense. In addition, nonproductive re-crews and road crew over time, indicators of network fluidity improved significantly year-over-year. These favorable operating results enabled a 7% year-over-year decline in the active train and engine employee base and drove an 8% improvement in crew utilization as measured by gross ton-miles per active train and engine employee. Shifting to the mechanical side, the active locomotive count was down 10% year-over-year and over 600 locomotives are currently in storage. The total active locomotive count is now down over 1,200 units since the end of 2016. The smaller locomotive fleet, combined with fewer cars online and freight car repair efficiencies, helped drive an 8% year-over-year decrease in our mechanical craft workforce. Regarding our total workforce, which includes management and union employees, as well as contractors and consultants, we achieved reductions of nearly 500 resources in the first quarter versus the end of 2018 benchmark. Improved service, a more fluid network and fewer assets in operation, together with opportunistic streamlining in our support functions, continued to drive labor productivity. As discussed on our fourth quarter call, we expect to absorb normal levels of attrition this year and our first quarter results indicate we are on track to meet that goal. During the quarter, we also recognized railroad retirement tax refunds related to relocation reimbursements from prior years. We do not expect any additional recoveries going forward. MS&O expense improved 1% versus the prior year, lower intermodal volumes resulting from previously announced lane rationalizations drove reduced expense, including terminal, trucking and other freight handling costs. We continue to see efficiencies attributed to our lower active locomotive count, driving savings in materials and contracted services. Train accident costs were also favorable in the quarter. Real estate and line sale gains were $5 million lower in the first quarter versus the prior year. We are making good progress against our three-year $300 million cumulative real estate sales target that continue to see a strong pipeline of real estate sales and line sale opportunities, though the impact of these transactions will remain uneven from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Looking at the other expense items, depreciation increased 2% due to the impact of a larger net asset base. Fuel expense was down 9% year-over-year, driven primarily by a 5% decrease in the per gallon price and further aided by efficiency. Our enhanced focus on utilization of distributed power and energy management software, combined with train handling rules compliance drove a record first quarter fuel efficiency. Specifically, in this year\u2019s first quarter, we utilized 1.9 million fewer gallons to move a similar level of gross ton-miles. Equipment rents expense decreased 1%, driven by improved car cycle times in automotive, merchandise and intermodal. Equity earnings decreased $6 million in the quarter, primarily due to state and federal tax true-ups at our affiliates. We would expect this line item to be approximately $25 million per quarter absent unique items. Looking below the line, interest expense increased, primarily due to higher debt balances, partially offset by a lower weighted average coupon rate. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.6%, reflecting benefits related to stock option exercises and divesting of other equity awards, as well as the settling of state tax matters. Absent unique items, we would expect an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5% for the remaining three quarters. Closing out the P&L, as Jim highlighted in his opening remarks, CSX delivered operating income of $1.2 billion, first quarter record operating ratio of 59.5% and earnings per share of $1.02, representing improvements of 17%, 420 basis points and 31%, respectively, year-over-year. Turning to the cash side of the equation on Slide 11. Capital investment was relatively flat year-over-year. We continue to invest in our core track infrastructure to provide safe and reliable train operations. Overall, our reduced asset intensity, especially in rolling stock, has enabled us to sustain lower levels of capital investment without compromising safety or liability. The level of PTC spending has also come down significantly in the last two years. Growth in CSX\u2019s core operating cash flow generation drove a 33% increase in adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter. The company converted net income to free cash at more than 100% during the quarter. Similar to last year\u2019s first quarter, we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders, including approximately $800 million in buybacks and $200 million in dividends. In the quarter, we completed the prior share buyback authorization and began purchasing shares as part of the new $5 billion program we announced in January. Our share buyback activity in the quarter netted an average repurchase price of roughly $69 per share. Dividend payments in the quarter reflect a 9% increase from $0.22 to $0.24 per share we announced in February of this year net of a lower share count. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. James Foote : Great. Thank you, Frank. Turning to Slide 13, I\u2019d like to wrap things up by reiterating our outlook for the year. Very little has changed with our view of revenue performance, so we are still expecting full-year growth in the low single-digit range. We expect growth to come from merchandise, the core of our franchise. Intermodal revenues are expected to remain muted, as we work our way through the impact of intermodal lane rationalizations and the outlook for coal looks as expected softer later this year as thermal benchmark prices moderate and gas prices remain low. The top line outlook, of course, remains dependent on underlying economic conditions. We are diligently monitoring our markets and are in constant dialogue with our customers, but generally, any market demand remains stable. Additionally, we are maintaining our full-year operating ratio guidance of below 60%, as well as our $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion CapEx outlook. The efficiency reflected in our operating costs also translates to the capital side of the business, and we are able to do more work on the network at lower cost. Efficiency also creates additional network capacity, which allows us to maintain an efficient capital spending program. We are, in fact, investing in the core infrastructure of the railroad at above our historical average rates. Excuse me. This quarter reflects the strength of our operating model. As we are able to more efficiently manage our business through what is traditionally our most challenging operating quarter, while still improving customer service. CSX is an exceptional company with an extraordinary heritage. Our transformation to becoming the best run railroad in North America is beginning to find traction. The railroad is running better, but we can still make many improvements. We are continuously looking for new ways to serve our customers and eliminate bureaucracy that slows us down. We are working hard everyday to make CSX the best run railroad in North America. With that, thank you, and I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill. Bill Slater : Thank you, Jim. For the interest of time, I would like to ask everyone to limit themselves to one question. Mischelle will take questions now. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Allison Landry from Credit Suisse, you may go ahead. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good job on the quarter. I guess, not to start out with a negative question, but in terms of export coal and where API2 prices are currently trending. Could you maybe tell us what percent of the overall book for export is under contract? And when those might roll off? Mark Wallace : Yes. This is Mark. So we got about 90% of our total export tons locked in for the year. So as I think, I said back three months ago, last year, we did about 43 million export tons. We expect to be in the low-40s for this year. Allison Landry : Okay. And then on the intermodal network redesign, is there a way to think about the delta between the profitability of legacy franchise? And where you think ultimately, you can take the margins whether that\u2019s this year or 2020 or whatever? But could that be enough to insulate consolidated margins in a flat or declining revenue scenario? James Foote : Allison, I think, we\u2019re clearly pleased with the progress we\u2019re making on the intermodal changes that we announced. We all know that combined with the changes that we announced. In October of last year and then again in January, we took at about 8% of our volumes. I think, we\u2019re down 5% revenue for Q1. So net-net, we\u2019re sort of ahead, up 3%. Listen, we got a lot of work to do. This is a long game here. The \u2013 these changes are going to take place over the next several quarters and several years. We don\u2019t have any major structural changes that are leaning in front of us that we\u2019re going to implement. But clearly, we\u2019re working hard every day to drive down costs and improve the efficiency and the speed and the reliability of our intermodal business. So we\u2019re pleased with the progress to date, but we\u2019re not satisfied yet. And we hope, as we\u2019ve talked about many, many times that the profitability of that segment will continue to increase over time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. You may go ahead. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I guess, I want to start on the operating ratio. So no change to the target yet. You guys are below, I guess, the target in the first quarter. If I look at seasonality over the last several years, you sort of had about a 300 basis point swing between first quarter and full-year OR. How should we think about seasonality this year, understanding maybe the back-half, there\u2019s going to be some potential pressures from coal, but how do you think about that? It would seem like you\u2019ve made already very, very strong progress to that full-year target? Frank Lonegro : Hey, Chris, it\u2019s Frank. You should expect some seasonality. As you think about the normal dip that you see between Q1 and Q2 and then fairly similar between Q2, Q3 and then up a little bit in Q4, it\u2019s probably not going to be as pronounced as what you\u2019ve seen in some prior years. But we expect to make progress Q2 versus Q1. And, obviously, we got our eyes on the macro like everybody else and feel pretty good about where we started out the year. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. If I could just get a quick follow-up here just on the labor side. Wanted to make sure I understand the cadence. I think, Frank, you talked about absorbing attrition. We should assume that somewhere in that kind of almost 7% type of range from a headcount perspective as we move through the rest of the year? Frank Lonegro : Yes, the guidance that we put out on the Q4 call and then Jim reiterated in some of the conferences he was at, our historical attrition levels would be in that 6% to 7% range. And we\u2019re really talking about the total workforce, which would include not just management and union folks, but also contractors and consultants in the roughly 500 or so that you saw year-to-date, so pretty good start against that target. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ken Hoexter : Great. Great job on the quarter. Just thinking about the state of the market, Jim, can you talk about historical thoughts as pricing in the truck market loosens and pricing pulls back a bit there on intermodal. Can merchandise remain solid? Can you talk about the correlation we could expect to see given the pressure on the intermodal pricing side? James Foote : Well, again, our focus has them since the day I walked in the door here that this operating model works best for transforming the merchandise business into a much more effective competitor with the highway. And we already know that the customers are paying 15% to 20% more to ship by truck in those market segments. So, again, so the spot market pricing of trucks really is irrelevant. It\u2019s all about how much we can improve our service, which will allow us to grow our business in the future in merchandise. On the intermodal side of the business, again, we have long-term relationships with various channel partners and are interested in jointly developing transportation solutions that are going to make us both competitive in the marketplace. And again, the spot market somewhat loosening of the truck market there does not diminish the significance and the value that the railroad plays in the transportation marketplace in intermodal. When you\u2019re looking at some of these long-haul moves Chicago, New York, Chicago, South Florida are up and down the East Coast. So we still have a significant advantage in terms of cost in those long-haul moves, and we\u2019ll continue to work with our partners to leverage that. Ken Hoexter : That\u2019s great. If I could just get a quick follow-up on that, that same subject. And so, as you improve the performance significantly versus where you were, you\u2019ve always talked more about taking business from the highway. Do you feel like that\u2019s where you\u2019re really winning from? Are you seeing the competitor make strides in improving their performance relative to where they had been to keep that gap narrow, or are you seeing kind of any significant gains there? James Foote : Well, I think our growth over the last 12 months in the merchandise business segment at CSX has been a significant transformation. You haven\u2019t seen this kind of sustained volume growth at CSX. You have to go back to kind of like 2014 or early 2015 in order to find this kind of growth. And it\u2019s directly related to the fact that we have a product now that the customers are willing to rely upon and give us more of their transportation spend, whereas in the past, they\u2019ve may be given 50% or 60% of the volume to rail and 40% to truck, because they didn\u2019t trust the reliability of the railroad to get their products across to market. And that is where we are seeing our growth come from. It is from our existing customers to a large degree, where we are gaining a larger share of their transportation spend each and every day, and hopefully that will continue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So, Mark, maybe just on export coal, again, we have seen a pretty sharp drop in both the API2 and also Newcastle. Beginning with your comments about 90% being locked in, do you think the business is relatively well insulated for that? Export thermal coal is actually up in the first quarter, but just wondering how the drop we\u2019ve seen is going to play out in the markets and CSX\u2019s volumes later this year? Mark Wallace : Yes. I think \u2013 so again, the API2 is well \u2013 it\u2019s one of our thermals coal, as you know, goes to Europe. Mild winter temps there, high stockpiles, low natural gas prices, all create this low API2 number. We definitely have seen a little bit of softness. As I said, we do have all that volume locked in for this year. We were fortunate enough in the first quarter to pick up a nice win because of our service from our key competitor. But \u2013 so that helped with some of the volumes there and some of the business in the first quarter. But clearly, I think when you think about the thermal side of the export business, it\u2019s going to be a challenge, but we do have minimum volume guarantees there. So I think we\u2019re pretty insulated on the met side. The benchmarks remain strong. Forward curve is now $200, good demand. We did see a little bit of producer issues in the first quarter with some of the weather and frozen coal and some of that kind of stuff. But I fully expect that, that will rebound and we\u2019ll see some good strength there. So as \u2013 again, as I mentioned to Allison in the first question, we still expect low-40s. James Foote : And as I said in my concluding remarks there as it related to our outlook for the year, we had always expected, three months ago and earlier when we were putting together our guidance for the year, which we talked to you about in last call that this thermal benchmark was more likely than not to soften somewhat based upon all kinds of macro issues in Europe. We kind of thought that would be the case last year as well. And as we all know, we got a little bit of tailwind last year, because it didn\u2019t. So we\u2019ve always been somewhat cautious on this topic. And so our number that Mark\u2019s talking about there is where we thought it would be. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re kind of telling you that we don\u2019t expect the coal to continue at the rates that it did in Q1, and it\u2019s not going to be a big factor in the overall top line growth of the company this year. Brian Ossenbeck : I appreciate that. Mark, if you can just give us the update on the stockpiles, domestic utilities in North and South? Mark Wallace : Yes. So stockpiles in the north are somewhat flat year-over-year going into the year, going into January, February, the sales was 13-year lows. They\u2019re still down versus where they were this time last year, but some of them have been replenished. And so we we\u2019ll see what happens over the course of the year, but we\u2019re all praying for a nice hot summer in the same period. So that we can burn all our utilities. We burn a lot of coal, we can move more. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Congrats on the good quarter. My question \u2013 first question is just on the competitive dynamics, Norfolk Southern is obviously pursuing PSR via yield-up strategy that provides CSX with a pricing umbrella for your business and I think we saw some of that in the quarter. But I would assume it also allows you to go after some market share. If you can just help us understand how you\u2019re thinking about or approaching that opportunity? Are you seeing market share opportunities as a direct result of those initiatives? And would you be maybe willing to have more balanced approach between volume and price, given the structural cost advantage that you have after the PSR initiatives? Thanks. Mark Wallace : Yes. Clearly, it\u2019s inappropriate for me to comment on the Norfolk Southern\u2019s pricing strategy. But clearly, replaced to the value that we had. And we\u2019re seeing some early good results there. We have a superior service product that\u2019s in the market now that we\u2019re providing to our customers. And I\u2019m very pleased with the pricing that we\u2019re extracting for the value that we\u2019re adding to our customer base. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. And just one follow-up if I could. Jim, just really about any structural factors that are limiting CSX\u2019s profitability. I believe when we \u2013 when you guys started this journey, you talked about CSX\u2019s profitability relative to everybody else in the industry, now almost everybody in the industry is now pursuing PSR and arguably has big targets out there. So is CSX still committed to being the best in North America from an OR perspective? And if so, what are the other areas of focus that can drive further OR improvement after the stellar results you guys have already done to date? James Foote : Well, I would say that there clearly were two structural advantages when CSX \u2013 disadvantages when CSX started this transformation under Mr. Harrison\u2019s leadership and Hunter dealt with those effectively. He ate the spaghetti and [got rid of that spaghetti more aligned], so that myth is gone. And he obviously put a foam over the railroad, because we were not impacted by the weather this quarter. We are the leader. We are the leader in efficiency. We\u2019re the leader in our operating ratio. And I believe we\u2019re probably this quarter going to be, if not clearly and probably a North \u2013 in the U.S. maybe not North America, so leader in growth. And I\u2019ve got a couple other leadership targets that we\u2019re going to hit hopefully by the end of this year. So we are the best. My focus is and everybody\u2019s focus is to make sure that we continue to be the best and there is no impediment, none whatsoever that should stop us from achieving that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. You may go ahead. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good afternoon. Let\u2019s see, impressive operating ratio in the first quarter to be below 60%. Wanted to ask you on the intermodal revenue per car that was \u2013 I think, that was roughly flattish. I would have expected maybe that the rationalizations might help you from a mix perspective, I don\u2019t know if mix was a factor. But what\u2019s happening with revenue per car? Is that a function of, you have longer kind of contracts with your customers and you can\u2019t do much on price, or maybe just help me think about how much of the intermodal you can reprice in \u2013 this year or a typical year? Mark Wallace : Tom, it\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the comments. Revenue per car for intermodal, yes, I mean, it\u2019s a mix issue. Clearly, lane rationalizations play into that, but most of our intermodal businesses are on the contracts, so, 90%-plus very little spot business. So \u2013 but the lane rationalizations have the biggest impact on the European intermodal this quarter. Frank Lonegro : Tom, it\u2019s Frank. One of the things to just keep in mind, we do have a small piece of our intermodal portfolio, which is what we call door-to-door, and that one has got some higher RPUs. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. So you\u2019re implying that was part of the rationalization was the door-to-door? Frank Lonegro : It really wasn\u2019t part of the rationalizations. It was more in just a small segment of the business, which didn\u2019t grow nearly as much. So I\u2019d say, it\u2019s just mixed within the \u2013 the rationalizations have more to do with profitability in this year with RPU. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, all right. And then for the follow-up, I just wanted to see if you could offer a thought on how we might model revenue \u2013 excuse me, comp and benefits per employee. It sounds like you might have had a benefit in the quarter or you did from the railroad retirement tax? I don\u2019t know if you want to quantify that and offer a thought about how much inflation per worker should we think about looking forward? Frank Lonegro : Yes, a couple of questions in there, Tom. I think, we were about 30,000 per employee per quarter. It\u2019s relatively flat on a sequential basis, not really much to do with the railroad retirement item, which was about $15 million in the quarter. So not tons on that big of a labor and fringe line. What I think you\u2019re going to continue to see is something around the $30,000 per quarter per employee number. Obviously, there\u2019s a little bit of an uptick in mid-year as we go through the annual general wage increase for our union and management employees. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Mark, just one more follow-up on export thermal. Does your pricing adjust quarterly with the API indexer or the rates locked with the contracts? I\u2019m just not sure if we should think about it like met coal or not from a pricing standpoint? Mark Wallace : The contracts are priced annually. Scott Group : Okay. And then... Mark Wallace : On the met side, they\u2019re repriced quarterly, based on the benchmarks. Scott Group : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just bigger picture, so I think you talked more directionally about pricing these days. It looks like pricing is still improving sequentially. Core pricing is still improving sequentially. Is that right? And do you think that, that can continue going forward into the rest of the year, or does pricing at some point start to moderate a little bit just as we\u2019re seeing truckload and intermodal pricing start to moderate? James Foote : Across the board, Scott\u2026 Scott Group : Yes. James Foote : \u2026again, the 66% of our business is merchandise. And to the extent that we continue to drive and improve our product. We\u2019re going to consistently get price increases. It\u2019s just plain and simple. We don\u2019t view this \u2013 that segment of the business. We\u2019ll view \u2013 hardly any of our business as a commodity, that\u2019s just out there trading around based upon who has got the lowest price in town. Our focus is on making sure that we have the best long railroad and the best reliable service that we can sell to our customers. And the customers have indicted a willingness to pay for that level of service and reliability. So there is no reason in the world for us to discount our price. If again, if there\u2019s a customer out there that says to me, \"Jim, I could care less about your service. I just want the lowest price in town, well, guess what, I\u2019m the lowest-cost guy in town. So if I wanted to play that game, I can play that game too, but that is clearly not our focus or our intention. Mark Wallace : We implemented a level of discipline, but here and I can tell you that every contracts now gets my review. And so what I can tell you is as I said previously, I\u2019m extremely pleased with the value that we are extracting for the year, value of the service product we\u2019re delivering. Scott Group : Okay, that\u2019s a good answer. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. James Foote : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Justin Long from Stephens. You may go ahead. Justin Long : Thanks, and congrats on the quarter. So maybe to start with one for Jim. You classified the demand environment as stable. But one of your IMC partners said yesterday, they\u2019re not seeing a snapback in demand in March and April, as they had hoped. When you strip out the noise from weather, are you seeing anything that gives you pause about the economic backdrop, or are you confident that we\u2019ll see volume growth from CSX over the remainder of the year? James Foote : Well, the volume growth from CSX will be, as I described in my concluding remarks, principally for merchandise because of these aberrations just muted growth in intermodal, as I said, because of the lane rationalizations and coal because of the factors associated with the export thermal coal. So to comment \u2013 respond directly to your comment about someone else in the transportation space that\u2019s already talked about how they saw the first quarter. From what I\u2019ve heard from other people in the transportation spaces already talked about what they saw in the first quarter, nothing surprising whatsoever. Clearly, everybody knew that there was bad weather, especially in the west that was impacting traffic volumes. Everybody knew that everybody moved as much traffic as it possibly could forward in anticipation of tariffs. Everybody knew that there was a unique factor this year with the tariffs possibly being implemented with this \u2013 with the start of our Chinese New Year. So there was a lot of noise and a lot of aberration and a lot of issues in the first quarter that everybody was going to have to work their way through. And so there was no surprise \u2013 there has been no surprise to me at all. I think, we\u2019re all just kind of now kind of figure out what\u2019s going to happen with the material that\u2019s already in the warehouse that needs to move. Clearly, you\u2019re going to start to figure out seasonal changes. But right now, I\u2019m sure everything is kind of pre-positioned for the Memorial Day sales and probably the 4th of July. So \u2013 but that stuff has got to move out. So we can get the fall goods in and that sort of thing. But everybody is on a wait-and-see, but no surprises right now, it\u2019s about what we had expected it would be related to the tariffs and the reaction in the marketplace due to the difficult piece with weather is something that both of us who have been around the business for a long time [indiscernible] before. Justin Long : Thanks. That\u2019s really helpful. And then secondly, going back to the truckload conversion opportunity, when you think about that addressable market, what percentage of that market would you say is in the Intermodal business versus the general merchandise business? And are the incremental margins on those conversions is pretty similar when you compare intermodal to general merchandise? James Foote : The biggest opportunity for us is in the merchandise business. Again, when I talk to whether it\u2019s a paper producer, a steel producer, a plastics producer or whoever they are out there, they\u2019re not moving their product today over a long distance in a hopper car and making a really buck doing it. We maybe have 60% of the business, because they\u2019re more in trust us with the other 40%, because we\u2019re not reliable enough and our service is not good enough for them to serve their customers. And so that\u2019s the key, that is the focus. That is the greatest opportunity and that is business that today is very, very, very good business for the railroad. In the intermodal business, clearly, once we get our network reconfigured and more focused, we will begin to offer an alternative product there to the large number of shippers of different types of commodities that are again also looking for extremely reliable service. Again, whether you\u2019re a plastic shipper or a steel shipper or whether or not, you\u2019re a shipper of a lot \u2013 whole bunch of little bitty boxes with smiles on the side of them. You\u2019re not going to use the railroad if it\u2019s not reliable. So we need to get as reliable in that area in order to make sure that, that traffic moves in intermodal service as well. Frank Lonegro : Hey, Justin, it\u2019s Frank. On the incremental, let me \u2013 obviously, that are going to be high on both, because they\u2019re using existing trains, existing crews, you maybe burn a little bit of fuel and touch it in the yards, but they\u2019ll both be high. Justin Long : Okay, great. Thanks for the time. James Foote : Great, Justin. Operator : Thank you. Ben Hartford from Baird. You may go ahead. Ben Hartford : Hey, thanks. Maybe just to follow-up on that intermodal question. As you think about getting through this lane rationalization this year and you start to continue to see service improvement. As you look out over the next several years, is there a good number to think about in terms of what the pace of domestic intermodal volume growth can be annually as you look at the market? Is it low single-digit? Is it kind of in line with IP or GDP growth, or can we still think of it as being a multiple of that underlying market growth rate? Mark Wallace : Yes. I think I would expect that we would get back to the high single-digit growth number. Ben Hartford : Okay, good. And is that something in 2020 that\u2019s conceivable or is that going to take a little bit of time to get back into that high single-digit growth pace? James Foote : It\u2019s certainly what the economy is going to do and I\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019re going to do. But all things being equal here, I mean, I could see us getting back to next year, getting into 2021, yes. I mean, that would be my expectation. Listen, we\u2019re not focused on driving volume right now. We\u2019re focused on driving profitable growth. And so we need to fix \u2013 as Jim just alluded to, we need to fix \u2013 continue to fix the Intermodal segment. We\u2019re working through that every day. And \u2013 but we want to bring business under the railroad, that\u2019s going to be profitable and that\u2019s going to be around here for a long time. Ben Hartford : Thanks. And then just to follow-up on the international intermodal side, how do you think about the long-term growth opportunity there? Is that more of a in line with import growth, or is there still kind of a total addressable market expansion opportunity there as well? James Foote : No, there\u2019s still an addressable market that we\u2019re going after. I mean listen, there\u2019s a lot of stuff coming in West Coast, East Coast, all that stuff. And we \u2013 given our service and given some of the service offerings in our new facility Northwest, Ohio, we\u2019re attracting a lot of attention and we want to attract some more business and it\u2019s getting the attention of the international players out there. And so we\u2019re looking forward to growing that market segment. It\u2019s a good one for us. We provide a good value and we hope to recapture more of that share going forward. Ben Hartford : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. You may go ahead. David Vernon : Hey, good afternoon, guys. So maybe just as you think about the service levels that you guys are getting right now, if we strip out that $23 million on the contract settlement, you\u2019re still running around $150 million in the accessorials and sort of other revenue. Is there a point where that number starts to fade off a little bit as the incidents, which are causing some of the demurrage issues and stuff like that as customers adjust their supply chains, or should we be kind of baking in that $150 million level kind of going forward? Frank Lonegro : Hey, David, it\u2019s Frank. Yes, I think you\u2019ve got it right. The idea is that it will come down a little bit. We guided earlier on the Q4 call that on a full-year \u2013 over full-year basis, it would be lower. So if I were plugging in, I\u2019d be in that $130 million to $135 million a quarter number. Now that\u2019s absent anything you need. David Vernon : Okay. Mark Wallace : But again, that\u2019s a good news story, because our customers aren\u2019t holding onto our cars and they\u2019re spinning them faster and we\u2019re getting better asset utilization. So we\u2019re not looking at driving that number higher. We\u2019re looking at driving hopefully it goes lower, but those cars spin, better asset utilization better service. James Foote : That\u2019s what the charges are there for. David Vernon : All right. And then, maybe just to clarify, just make sure I got the list of the stuff on here. So the $23 million was the contract renewal. The $15 million in the labor line, is that recurring or is that just the one-time in the first quarter or are we going to see that every quarter? Frank Lonegro : One-time first quarter only. David Vernon : And then $27 million in land sales, right? Frank Lonegro : Yes, which was down $5 million year-over-year. David Vernon : Okay. Anything else with the dogs or cats that we\u2019re in that sort of like $5 million to $10 million range, or is that 65 the right number? Frank Lonegro : No, I think you got it. David Vernon : All right. Thanks, guys. James Foote : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good evening, everyone. Just to follow-up on the intermodal conversations. When do you think you might see that big inflection where the service is good enough that shippers acknowledge the value proposition of IM over rail and you \u2013 over truck and you start to see this kind of big conversions to your intermodal business? James Foote : Well, as Mark said, he\u2019s \u2013 Mark is pretty optimistic about where we \u2013 he thinks the growth rate is going to be. If you look at last year, we started this rationalization last year. We took off 7% of the business last year and we finished the year up 2%. So those growth rates that Mark is talking about, upper single-digit are clearly not unrealistic once we get our network in order. And the \u2013 again, our intermodal service, I think right now is pretty fantastic. What we got out of in terms of lane rationalizations was a regional kind of a short-haul intermodal service that had really nothing to do with the rates. It was \u2013 but it was the number of multiple handlings associated with it that it was difficult to absorb those costs in the intermodal business. So we decided to exit that regional strategy and get back to a more traditional network strategy leveraging the franchise we have, linking together our 25 or so key intermodal terminals and working with truckers that clearly see the advantages to the intermodal services, because it reduces their overall costs as well. So once we get through this \u2013 some of these challenges that we have from a structural standpoint, which should be by the end of this year and maybe tip over into next year, because some of them were just started this quarter of this year, then I think you\u2019ll start to see this business growth rates coming back to their more appropriate levels. Ravi Shanker : Got it. And just to follow up on something you said earlier about some shippers wanting just lowest price. I don\u2019t know if you can answer this question, but can you kind of quantify what percentage of your shippers, specifically in intermodal and merchandise, are folks who prioritize service versus folks who just want the lowest price? James Foote : I think in the \u2013 I think without a doubt, 100% of our merchandise customers, which are \u2013 and 100% of our merchandise customers clearly, if you ask them, are focused on \u2013 their number one priority is reliability. If you \u2013 if they\u2019re coal customers, again, we\u2019re part of a supply chain that involves piers, involves terminals, involves ships, involves utilities running. They want reliability. They don\u2019t want to screw around and they don\u2019t have the flexibility in their supply chain to absorb inefficiency. If you ask the domestic intermodal customer, especially those associated with e-commerce, when they make a commitment to a customer that they\u2019re going to have a package delivered across the country in 24 to 48 hours, they don\u2019t screw around, they want it there in 24 to 48 hours. That kind of leaves a little group left over that you can figure out who like to bundle up a whole bunch of containers and put them into a steam ship port someplace and say we\u2019re interested in price. So that\u2019s a small minority of our customers. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. So I just want to come back to a prior question just so I understand it. Mark, when asked about any indication that you might have picked up in recent conversations with your customers with regards to potentially waning demand again just in a recent month or so saying that, okay, yes, we did have \u2013 you did have the marketing, yes we did have weather and all that. But all that aside, are you detecting any change in tone with your customer conversations that would indicate perhaps a slightly lower growth rate or lower demand for freight cars than you had when you set your guidance at the beginning of the year? Mark Wallace : So listen, again, our service in the first quarter and \u2013 is very good. Our customers are recognizing that service. Q1, a lot of noise. Jim alluded to it. We had weather \u2013 bad weather in February, lane rationalizations, intermodal were \u2013 our channel partners were out for a good season with Chinese New Year with a lot going on. So try to put all that in the blender and try to figure out what exactly is happening in intermodal, good luck with you, because I\u2019m still trying to figure it out. But listen, we had a good service product out there. Our partners, whether it\u2019s intermodal or in the carload side, are clearly seeing the value of that. Their tone with us is changing. It\u2019s only getting better and better every day. I spent recently a lot of time with a lot of different customers across the portfolio. We\u2019re winning new business every day, both from truck and from rail. They\u2019re pleased with us. And so yes, I\u2019m very happy with where we are. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic for the remainder of the year. People are as well. Business confidence remains relatively good. Nobody is selling any fire alarms. And so given all that and given Jim\u2019s comments earlier about the strength of \u2013 what we see in our key merchandise portfolio, I\u2019m really confident there. But we do have some issues with these lane rationalizations that we did in the coal. So \u2013 but now we\u2019re good. Walter Spracklin : Okay, that\u2019s comfort again. Just a follow-up here. I think if I wrote it down correctly last quarter, Mark, you had indicated that your volume expectation for the full-year would be flat to slightly up and that your intermodal would, I would say, I wrote down a low intermodal growth. Now you\u2019ve got negative 4.5% in the first quarter and then full-year total volume negative 0.1%. Are we going to see just an improvement here as we go through the quarter and get back up to some kind of positive overall growth and perhaps not quite as strong a downturn for the rest of the year in intermodal as we did \u2013 as we saw in the first quarter? Mark Wallace : I think we\u2019re expecting some growth there in Q4. So it should be \u2013 we\u2019ll see sort of flattish and then hopefully up for \u2013 in Q4. But where the expectations for intermodal on a volume is still I hope to be flattish and I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s what the, maybe I\u2019ll use Jim\u2019s word a touch below that, but hopefully, we can come in flat. Walter Spracklin : Okay, perfect. That\u2019s all my questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital. Brandon Oglenski : Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for getting me in here at the end. Mark, I guess, investors have really, Mark, can be fickle and we\u2019ve all turned our attention to the new PSR stories across The Street in the East Coast with the bigger railroad out west. But I guess, maybe folks don\u2019t appreciate all the changes that you\u2019ve made on the sales and marketing side. So, one, can you talk about what you\u2019re doing different now in approaching the market with the organization that you have in place? And is the organization fully built out? And then I guess, number two, I think at your analyst meeting last year, you called out like a 4% long-term growth CAGR for merchandise. Is that still the right outlook given the changes you made on the team? Mark Wallace : I certainly hope so. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re chasing and going after and I\u2019d lie to you if I said I wasn\u2019t trying to beat that number. Listen, we \u2013 I think, we have a very solid team. Now I\u2019ve been in this job for about nine months now. The first half of my time, three quarters of my time, I was out meeting with a lot of customers, introducing myself and learning about their businesses and how we can provide value to them. Most recently, I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time with our team. We just announced three weeks ago, a month ago some major \u2013 a major reorganization in the sales and marketing team. Now it wasn\u2019t only Arthur Adams and Kevin Boone that got new jobs. And listen, what we\u2019re trying to do with Kevin\u2019s team, my view was, well, as good as we thought we were with sales and marketing. We were really lacking or missing the deep core understanding of our customers\u2019 businesses and how we could help them succeed in the marketplace and how we can provide value as a transportation and logistics solutions provider to enable their growth. And so we needed to up our analytical and our data-driven business and get some people in the organization that had that skill set and really drive value there by understanding our customers and how they\u2019re going to grow going forward and how we can be a provider with them and grow with them. So that\u2019s what Kevin\u2019s team is doing. That\u2019s where we\u2019re going to grow. We\u2019re spending a lot of time with Kevin. We brought some people into focus on regional sales. We brought some people into focus on our short-line strategy growing with our short-line partners. If you look back over the last five years, our volumes with our short-line partners has declined CAGR, I think 3% over a year. That\u2019s not acceptable. We got to turn that around, we got to grow that. We\u2019re working on our port development strategy and a whole bunch of other initiatives, including trying to be better partners and provide better customer relations with our customers under Arthur Adams\u2019 group. So a lot of different things going on. I think all this culminates into growing merchandise. And that\u2019s my focus. That\u2019s the growth area for us. That\u2019s where we\u2019ve lost volume over the last four, five years. And my goal and my job is to grow this organization and figure out ways to enable that growth. And so we\u2019re not leaving any stone unturned. It\u2019s a full force ahead. I\u2019ve got the resources, I\u2019ve got the team. We\u2019re probably a trade or two away from having a full complement of a team that I really want to go forward. So maybe one or two extra little moves here to make in the next little while, but \u2013 so stay tuned for that. But clearly, we\u2019re heading in the right direction. We got a fantastic team under me right now and we\u2019re focused on the future and focused on growing. Brandon Oglenski : I appreciate it, Mark. Thank you. Mark Wallace : Yep, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities. You may go ahead. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Wanted to pivot away from sales and marketing quickly and ask if you could talk about how your use of distributed power has expanded and how much further runway you think you have with that particular lever? James Foote : Well, you have \u2013 distributed power was not used by CSX really until some of our operating team got here was just more familiar with using it for years for years either in Canada or in the West. And so we have been aggressively implementing that across the network from zero a little over a year ago up to about 68 to 70 trains a day now. So we\u2019ve got a big portion of the key trains operating in that manner today with a lot more in 2019 and a lot more opportunity for us to grow that as we go forward. Cherilyn Radbourne : Great. And then quickly on share buybacks, you bought back about $800 million in the quarter. Frank, any thoughts on how quickly you might complete your latest program there? Frank Lonegro : Yes. We really didn\u2019t set a time frame on this one. We\u2019ll take a look at how we\u2019re doing, how the economy is doing, what the share price looks like in the quarter. We did get a bit of a slow start, because we were still finishing up a prior program, which exhausted right around the Q4 earnings call. So we really weren\u2019t that heavily in the market in the first two or three weeks of this year. Cherilyn Radbourne : That\u2019s all for me. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International. Thank you. Bascome Majors : Yes. Can you guys talk in broad strokes about the contractual prices that you\u2019re achieving this year and how it compared to the price increases that you achieved last year? And specifically that question really across the truck competitive business, maybe separately for merchandise and separately for intermodal? Thank you. James Foote : Well, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark Wallace. The short answer is no. But we can give you some general guidance along the lines that we\u2019ve been talking, but just generally, what our philosophy is toward merchandise, intermodal and coal and Mark will do that. Mark Wallace : I\u2019ll repeat, no. But no, again, we\u2019re continuing to enjoy solid results for the value that we provide to our customers and so not only in intermodal. Now again, a lot of our intermodal business is locked up in multiyear contracts. So, rates are predetermined with escalators every year. But on the merchandise side, again, it\u2019s about winning incremental business, converting that freight from the highway. As Jim talked about, some shippers ship both by rail and by truck because of our lack of having a good service product and lack of reliability in the past. As we become more reliable and consistent, they want to use rail. And so if we can convert that business, it\u2019s all incremental. And merchandise sector, it\u2019s good business for us and we\u2019re happy to have it on the railroad. So that\u2019s our strategy and that\u2019s where we\u2019re winning and \u2013 but that\u2019s about as far as I want to go on the pricing side. Bascome Majors : Fair enough. Thank you for the comments. James Foote : Thank you. Bill Slater : Great. Thank you, everyone. I think that concludes our call for today. James Foote : Thank you very much, everybody. Operator : And thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. You may disconnect your lines.",

During this call, all participants will be on listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Slater, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. Bill Slater : Thank you, Shirley and good afternoon everyone. Joining me on today\u2019s call is Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Interim Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim Foote : Good afternoon and thanks a lot Bill. Before we get started with the presentation, I'd like to first thank all CSX employees whose hard work once again drove the company to new record operating levels this quarter. These records include operating income, free cash flow, and operating efficiency in the form of an all-time low operating ratio for our U.S. Class I railroad. Not only did we achieve record financial results, but we continued our industry leadership in safety with the best performance in terms of lowest personal injury rate and meaningfully reduced train accidents. During this quarter, we successfully completed PTC installation and activation across our network. We now operate nearly 13,000 PTC-equipped track miles and are on pace to have the system fully tested and operational with our tenant railroads ahead of the required deadline. Let's move on now to Slide 5 of the presentation and our financial results. Second quarter results were straightforward with only a few small and unique items that Kevin will discuss. Second quarter EPS increased 7% to $1.08 versus last year's figure of $1.01. Our second quarter operating ratio improved by 120 basis points to a record 57.4%. Turning to Slide 6, we are delivering better service to our customers, which is reflected in our merchandise volume as our improved reliability is leading to customers trusting us with more of their freight. This led to broad-based growth across the merchandise segment as customers are recognizing the value of our best-in-class service offering. This growth was offset by declines in coal, intermodal, and other revenue resulting in a 1% decline in total revenue to $3.1 billion. I remain encouraged by the performance of our core merchandise franchise during a softer-than-expected freight environment. We led Class I volume growth again this quarter, and grew volumes at all markets with the exception of metals and equipment and fertilizers. Total merchandise revenue increased 2% as volume growth and pricing gains were partially offset by mixed headwinds. Intermodal revenue declined 11% on 10% lower volumes, primarily due to the impact of line rationalizations implemented last fall and early this year. We'll begin to lap those rationalizations at the end of the third quarter. Coal revenue declined 2% on 2% higher volumes as growth in domestic industrial markets was more than offset by export and utility declines. Finally, lower other revenues was primarily due to decreases in demurrage markets at intermodal facilities. Let's move to slide 7. Employee safety remains my top priority. We were again the best in the industry for FRA personal injury rates and set a new company record for the lowest number of FRA reportable train accidents this quarter. We are also finding new ways to utilize technology to further enhance safety. As one example, the use of automated track inspection cars helped reduce track caused mainline accidents by 85% year-to-date. While I'm pleased with this progress, there's always opportunity to operate more safely and we will work diligently to make our railroad as safe as it can be. Let's turn to slide 8 and take a quick look at our operating performance. On the service side, Velocity and Dwell improved by 14% and 6%, respectively. We also set another U.S. Class I record this quarter by operating below one gallon of fuel per 1,000 gross ton miles as we continue to find new and incremental ways to improve efficiency and drive unproductive costs out of the system. Most importantly, our improved operations are transferring to better outcomes for customers. We dramatically improved our trip plan compliance over the last year and are seeing strong momentum exiting the quarter. We continue to hit new records and have done so while tightening the schedule in the form of shortage trip plans. We plan to roll out our trip plan compliance data to our customers later this year and look forward to the opportunities the increased transparency will provide us to engage more deeply with them. With that, I'll hand it over to Kevin, who will take you through the financials. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Jim and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to slide 10. I'll walk you through the highlights of the summary income statement. As Jim mentioned, total revenue was down 1% in the second quarter, as the impact of lower volume, particularly in intermodal, more than offset pricing gains across most of our markets. Moving to expenses. Total operating expenses were 3% lower in the second quarter, reflecting continued strong efficiency gains. Labor and fringe expense was 3% lower, driven by a 5% reduction in headcount combined with favorable incentive compensation expense. These savings were partially offset by inflation and other items. The operating team continues to drive efficiencies in a number of areas highlighted by fewer crew starts, down 5%; and lower T&E over time. Re-crews were also down 77%, a significant improvement year-over-year. Active locomotive count declined more than 300 locomotives, down 11% year-over-year. Smaller fleet combined with fewer cars online and freight car repair efficiencies helped drive a 6% year-over-year reduction in our mechanical workforce. MS&O expense improved 3% versus the prior year. Lower active locomotive count drove savings in materials and contracted services. Train accident costs were also favorable in the quarter as the FRA train accident rate fell over 50%. Intermodal costs also saw year-over-year improvement with lower volumes combined with operating efficiencies, driving expense reductions. Partially offsetting these items was an unfavorable impact from casualty reserve adjustments unrelated to the improving trends and safety. Real estate and line sale gains were flat in the second quarter versus the prior year. We continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities. Looking at the other expense items. Depreciation increased 2% due to the impact of a larger net asset base. Record fuel efficiency and a 6% decrease in diesel prices helped drive a 30% [ph] decline in fuel expense. Our enhanced focus on distributed power utilization and energy management technology drove record second quarter fuel efficiency. Equipment rent expense decreased 8%, driven by improved cycle times and lower volume-related costs in intermodal. Equity earnings decreased $9 billion in the quarter, primarily due to lower net earnings at our affiliates, including cycling an affiliate's property sale in the prior year. Looking below the line. Interest expense decreased primarily due to higher debt balances. Income tax expense increased $9 million, primarily due to the benefit in 2018 related to State legislative changes. For the remainder of the year, we would expect an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5% absent unique items. Closing out the P&L. As Jim highlighted in his opening remarks, CSX delivered operating income of $1.3 billion, record operating ratio of 57.4% and earnings per share of $1.08, representing improvements of 2%, 120 basis points and 7% respectively. We continue to see significant opportunities to drive efficiencies across every aspect of our business. Just a few other key initiatives into the back half of the year include; ongoing train consolidations through continued expansion of distributed power and additional longer crew runs. This reduces the active locomotive fleet and associated maintenance and repair cost, as well as crew labor and related travel and balancing expenses. Yard reductions enabled by train consolidations and longer runs will reduce labor and overhead costs. Overtime also remains a significant opportunity with a particular focus on its mechanical and engineering. There are multiple emphases across our business functions where overtime as a percentage of straight time is well over 20% and in some cases exceeding 40%. While we hit a record this quarter, fuel efficiency remains a big opportunity for us. I expect the operating teams continue to deliver savings. Train speed in dwell continues to be opportunities as well the related cost benefits remains significant. Finally, we are finding new opportunities to become more efficient in our G&A costs. Recent initiatives should benefit us in the second half. Turning to slide 11. Year-to-date capital investment is down $54 million or 7% year-over-year. At the same time, we have added 12% more rail and 25% more times, while doing it smarter. Overall, our improved asset utilization from locomotives to rolling stock has enabled us to sustain lower levels of capital investment without compromising safety or reliability. The level of PTC spending has also come down significantly in the last two years. Growth in CSX's core operating cash flow, including improvements in working capital, drove a 22% increase in adjusted free cash flow to $1.6 billion through the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $2 billion to shareholders, including $1.6 billion in buybacks and $400 million in dividends. Dividend payments in the quarter reflect a 9% increase from $ 0.22 to $0.24 per share we announced in February of this year. Our ability to convert earnings into cash remains the key differentiator for CSX and a significant driver of shareholder value. With that, let met turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Foote : Thanks Kevin. Turning to Slide 13, I want to wrap things up by discussing our guidance for the year. We started this year expecting revenue to be up approximately 1% to 2%. Both global and U.S. economic conditions had been unusual this year to say the least and have impacted our volumes. You see it every week in our reported carloads. The present economic backdrop is one of the most puzzling I have experienced in my career. With natural gas prices expected to continue to impact both domestic and export coal, intermodal is showing little seasonal recovery and many of our industrial customers volumes continuing to show weakness with no concrete signs of these trends changing; and adding in the impact on crude-by-rail shipment of last month\u2019s Philadelphia refiner explosion, we are now expecting revenues to be down 1% to 2% for the full year. We are not necessarily being pessimistic about the second half of the year. But in these launches we need to adjust guidance, we're just setting out the obvious. This outlook is based on a current business levels and there is upside to this forecast as conditions improve in the second half. We are seeing a range of conflicting data points and economic indicators and regularly speak with customers who despite the recent downtime -- slowdown, remain cautiously optimistic about the second half. Mark can add some color to this in the Q&A session. We feel it is most prudent to actively manage expenses today -- to today's volumes rather than take a wait-and-see approach. We still expect a sub-60 operating ratio for the year. Our planned cost reduction initiatives will not impact safety, service, and will ensure the business is positioned to handle any additional volumes when things pick up. Lastly, we are maintaining our $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion CapEx outlook for the year. Even though the year is off to a slower start than we had hoped, we still see significant opportunities ahead. We have a service product that is resonating with customers and a long list of opportunities to reduce expenses, decrease asset intensity, and improved efficiency by eliminating the unnecessary touches that had caused to slow us down. We are very proud of the progress to-date and there is still much more left to do. With that, thank you, and I'll turn it back to Bill. Bill Slater : Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time, I would ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up only if necessary. Shirley, we\u2019ll now take questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good afternoon and thanks for the discussion here. Jim, maybe just talk a little bit about the performance right. So, a phenomenal operating ratio. Yet when you show your data, the on-time arrivals continue to fall. Maybe just to understand how that's possible given -- are you tightening the timeframes to different levels or is that different than the improvements you're making on the performance? Jim Foote : Great. Well, the difference between on-time originations and on-time arrivals versus trip plan compliance, which is measuring the boxes that moves through the network. Our on-time departures as we report to the STB, we're close to 100%, high 90s now. And arrivals is in kind of in the high 80s \u2013 mid-to-high 80s just most recently here now. The trip plan compliance on the other hand, which is not measuring their train performance is measuring how the car moves through the network from the time we pick it up to the customer, and when we tell the customer, we'll have to his customer in 114 hours. How often do we make that 114-hour trip plan? And every time -- and when we started measuring this, we were maybe in the 30 -- high 30% of the time, we were making that trip plan to now we're in the high -- we're close to 90% in intermodal and high 70s for the carload business. And yes to your -- to answer your question, every time we start getting where we're producing really good results, Jamie and the operating team get in there and tighten-up the schedule and make it more difficult for everyone, because ultimately that results in a much better product for the customer. Kevin Boone : Ken to give you a little perspective, last year in the second quarter of 2018, we had on average less -- we had early departures of about 16 -- 76 minutes early, whereas, if you look at this year we're departing them only 20 minutes early. So, we gave ourselves a lot of cushion last year, which obviously would translate in a lot more costs. So, we're tightening the windows and you can see it in that differential, which helps us manage our assets a lot better. Ken Hoexter : Helpful review. And for my second one or follow-up I guess is maybe just moving over to Mark and Jim, since you opened that up. Maybe Mark you can talk about given the shift of the outlook, are you seeing an accelerating decline in some of the economic indicators you're looking at? It just looks like carloads you're right have -- if we take out the intermodal, which stays around that down double-digit given your lane closures. It seems to -- are you seeing an underlying deceleration in some of the outlook -- I don\u2019t know if you want to go by commodity or just\u2026? Mark Wallace : Thanks, Ken for that good opportunity. I think exclusive of the PES refinery explosion that Jim just talked about in Philadelphia that just happened a couple of weeks ago, our change in our revenue guidance is largely evenly attributable between our three segments of coal, merchandise, and intermodal. On the coal, export coal has been below our expectations, mostly driven by thermal and lower API2 benchmarks, which we think will likely continue into the second half. On the domestic utility side, our volumes are down relative to our expectations driven by continued lower natural gas prices. Going into the year, we were -- we thought Henry Hub was going to be somewhere around in our guidance, which for Henry Hub to be somewhere around 285. Now we're hovering between 240 and 250, which is now reflected in our guidance. On the merchandise, clearly as Jim mentioned, clearly there are signs of slowing economic conditions in both IDP and GDP for Q3 and Q4 pointing to a less robust economy in the second half. We've, obviously, seen evidence of this in our own business and now see a softer industrial environment with signs in our automotive, chemicals, and metals segment. But we're calling it as we see it, and the run rates we're seeing are based on the trends that we saw in June and coming into Q3. On the intermodal side, listen, we've clearly hoped for a more of a recovery, particularly in the fourth quarter of the year. But we're not immune from some of the pressures that the entire U.S. intermodal industry is facing right now with the weak trucking market coming off an exceptionally strong 2018. There's a lot of excess capacity in this market, and as a result of what we saw in 2018, a lot of trucks came into the market. That needs to be worked out. But listen, we\u2019re staying disciplined on serving our customers and providing everyone with, as Jim mentioned, great service. Now what would help? Obviously, what would help in the back half would be a resolution or clarity on trade tariffs would obviously help, but that is obviously beyond our control. But what is within our control is providing a high-quality service product to our customers and covering new opportunities to use that service product for both new and existing customers and to make sure that we are extracting a fair value for the service that we provide. So, hopefully, that covers the \u2013 a little bit of the explanation on what we're seeing. Ken Hoexter : No. Truly appreciate it. Thanks Jim, Mark, Kevin, Bill, thank you for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Allison Landry : Thanks. So, Jim, earlier you outlined a number of concerns in the freight environment and what you heard from customers. It sounds like maybe the risk is to the downside instead of an upside recovery. But, I guess, my question is, how much of a volume or revenue decline can the business model withstand, and you\u2019ve still grown EBIT on a year-over-year basis in 2019? Jim Foote : I don't know that we've ever model how much we can actually take out. I think, we're doing \u2013 we think, this is not something we woke up yesterday and said, well, guess what; the things are going a little bit softer than we had expected. We've been watching this throughout the first half, hoping as everyone did that things would turn around and the business levels would start to pick up, instead of just kind of slow, lazy malaise-type drift down across, which, as Mark said, kind of then accelerated as we got into June. And -- but we've been planning for this and watching it and taking steps for months now to, first of all, obviously, focus on G&A, because like the one of the things we don't want to do in these situations is reduce cost in the transportation side of the business that could impact service. Then you impact service and then your business can get softer. And then it gets softer, so you cut more and then you impact service and you start this downward trend. It would be much easier for us to respond if suddenly business just dropped 10% today, because then we would know exactly how to right-size the business for it and we'd know exactly where we could and could not take out the expenses to be -- in order to handle the volumes. So, we are doing the best we can and have done -- I think, the team did an amazing job in the second quarter of getting a lot of things done, getting a lot of things right-sized based upon what we were anticipating, what we were seeing and not really going into any kind of cost reductions on the transportation side of the business where the majority of our expenses are. If we see or if we saw -- and hopefully we don't, but if we saw a significant decline in our business levels, we would respond quickly and aggressively and do everything we could to try and maintain our cost structure and our advantage. At some point in time, I mean, there's just no way that we can take out the order of magnitude of the amount of cost that are necessary, if there were significant decline in revenues, but we'll continue to do our best and monitor it. So, far so good. I mean, things are not -- this is not doom and gloom, this is not end of days kind of thing. This has been a very slow drift from the beginning of the year. And as aggravating as it is under the current rules of engagement with the investment community, once we put guidance out when things start to look like we're not going to be able to achieve that guidance, we're obligated to give a new guidance. And so we've thought hard about it and said based upon where we are today if this is kind of the new run rate from today, then we'll probably be down 1% or 2%, especially when we just blew up an oil refinery there was a big customer of ours and -- which is by itself on an annualized basis 1% of our volumes. So, factored into this number that we've taken down is a one-time -- 1% hit in volumes, which we'll recognize this year associated with the refinery explosion. So, -- but to get back to your question, we can do a lot if we know directly what it is we're trying to achieve. In this environment, it's just a lot more challenging. Allison Landry : Okay, that's really helpful. Maybe just piggybacking on that a little bit. So, obviously, the volume declines accelerated and maybe in Q2 you try to do a little bit of right-sizing. So, should that along with your comments you guys made about having plenty of opportunity going forward for efficiency gains, is that -- should we read that as a signal that the year-over-year improvement the OR could accelerate from the 130 bps in Q2? Now, so, that wasn't a good number just trying to understand the trajectory going forward and how you're thinking about that? Thank you. Jim Foote : Alison, you're killing me. I mean, we do a fantastic job and then you want more. Come on. I think we'll just stick within this environment say going back to the original. We got -- this revenue topline view reflects a pretty significant reduction in revenue. And what we're seeing right now is we're going to achieve our goal of getting at an operating ratio of below 60%. And despite what everybody else does out there maintaining our leadership position as the most efficient railroad in North America. Allison Landry : Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Mark, one for you on export coal. When do you think that -- you mentioned API2 -- wanted to ask about met coal? When do you think that window will start to maybe a little bit tighter as seaborne prices if come in a bit? And are there any other changes that we've seen this cycle that maybe some longer term contracts or reservation systems at the ports that or even restructuring of the coal producers in Appalachia. Anything that you think can actually help extend the cycle for a little bit longer? Mark Wallace : Yeah. Brian thanks. I think on export coal, let me just start to a high level, I think we're still expecting export coal roughly around 40 million tons for the year. Thermal coal is as I talked about, obviously, some tough headwind there given the API2 numbers, but we're -- there's some tough things going on in Europe as Jim talked about with some low natural gas prices, the mild weather and low natural gas prices in Europe, so that's causing a little bit of headwind. On the met side, again, the benchmarks remain strong. They're about $190. We reprice those contracts quarterly. We're working with -- we're working now with all our export coal producers to look into next year. I\u2019m not going to give you any guidance, but we're having some success there and trying to lock up some volumes and not anything hugely significant, but especially on the thermal side, which is encouraging. But we work with these guys everyday, our customers and everyone's incentivized to move a lot of coal and heading into -- getting into next year. And hopefully as we get closer to the end of next year, we'll give you maybe a little bit more clarity on what our expectations are for 2020. Brian Ossenbeck : All right. Thanks. Thanks, Mark. Appreciate that. Maybe if you -- I have follow-up on that PS refinery. Jim gave us the rough magnitude of that. I was curious if maybe we\u2019ve seen some other headlines with U.S. Steel bringing down, I guess keeping down some blast furnaces. In the past you mentioned that the tariffs have actually helped domestic, steel production domestic met coal consumption, so I was wondering if that was or any other distinct advance reflected in the updated guidance? Mark Wallace : Yeah. Certainly, we had a huge -- we had a big volume quarter in steel and industrial coal. Now what's happening with some of those announcements, unfortunately some of those producers -- rules changed a little bit. We just talked about the declining or the softening industrial environment, which is obviously impacting them. Following the tariffs, they saw an increase in production. Unfortunately, now with the markets huge inventories went up and the markets going a little softer, prices are coming down. And so there's probably an excess in capacity there. And so, yeah, we expect that our metals and equipment volumes in the second half just because of the softer industrial environment will get a little bit softer unfortunately. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. So it sounds like it's considered in your current update? Mark Wallace : It is. Brian Ossenbeck : All right. Okay. Thanks for your time, Mark. Appreciate it. Mark Wallace : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Thanks, everybody, and congrats on the good operating performance. Jim, can you, I guess, maybe talk about the pricing environment. Is it harder to push pricing in the current volume and low-inflation environment? And can you just give us maybe a flavor of your ability to, just simply put, just charge a higher price for the better service that you guys are delivering? Jim Foote : Well, if you look at the \u2013 again, let's focus on there, there's two different business segments, there's intermodal and there's carload. Intermodal, our obligation there is to deliver a product that's as close as truck-like and to do so at a price that's cheaper than a truck, because of the service differentiation between the fact that the lift or the time in transit is going to take long. So as there's a very soft truck market out there right now and really marks a lot of excess capacity based upon some recent historical changes in the marketplace. It's a little more difficult for us. On the other hand, what we're really focusing on and as we talk a lot about, because it's two-thirds of our business and we \u2013 and very profitable long-term business for us is carload business. From a high-level perspective, in that situation we know that we're \u2013 that our customers are paying a 15% to 20% premium to move their product in a truck, because they want to buy service reliability. As we become more reliable in that supply chain, we should be able to get more and more of that business, and we should be able to do so at a premium price, because the customer is actually saving money by putting \u2013 taking the business off to highway and put it in a railcar. So that's where we focus intently on, leveraging the service product. Mark, do you want to add to that? Mark Wallace : No. I think that's exactly right and as we become more reliable and persistent and as the market soften and customers are holding onto product and just in time deliveries become more important. Our service comes at a premium and I think customers recognize that. We do a good job for them, we get it there when we say we're going to get it. Our deliveries \u2013 our tip plan compliance is very good, and so they're willing to pay for their premium service. Amit Mehrotra : Well, just as a quick follow-up to that. Why wouldn't we see that then those market share gains show up in the revenue? I mean, the revenue revision is not surprising, given all the headwinds you've discussed. But what if that would be improvements to the network on the carload side is the market share opportunity you just talked about. The realignment of the sales organization, those could translate to some market share gains. And so, maybe, it just takes a little longer than I appreciate, if you can just talk about where you are in kind of the evolution of capturing that market share. Because \u2013 it doesn't seem like it's showing up in the revenue numbers this year at least? Jim Foote : Well, again, as you -- I'd like to point out again, the carload is pretty -- the carload -- we are the most transparent industry in the world in as much as we report our sales volume on a weekly basis. And our merchandise business segment, even though everybody says, oh my god, something is wrong with CSX, the volumes are down 10%. Well, it's all intermodal, and we already told everybody in the world why our intermodal business was going to be down, nobody focus on the fact that our merchandise franchise was outperforming everybody else in the industry. And this is what exactly what we're talking about. So up until most recently, where we saw a couple of our industrial segments get much softer, we are very confident that the strategy of going -- having non-cyclical growth in our merchandise segment is achievable based upon our service product. And unfortunately, as I said, half of this -- or a significant portion of this merchandise business that we've now taken our guidance down on was associated with this one-time customer event and the rest of it is just kind of basically market-driven where in certain segments with our industrial customers, again, our grain business is doing really great. A lot of our segments of our business are doing really great. Not all grain moves in train, a lot of grain move in a boxcar -- individual boxcar that were taken for the truck and put in a boxcar. So, across the Board in this merchandise segment, we're seeing gains, we're seeing traffic come to us. And if you're a customer right now, it's kind of looking and saying like why maybe things are a little soft, maybe better where I continue to right-size my business to take control of my cost structure, how can I save money and one of my business. As you know, I can reduce my transportation spend overnight by taking the traffic off the road and putting it in the boxcar. 10 years ago, I wouldn't have done that because -- the product would have never got to where it was supposed to be. Nowadays, I'm willing to do that and I can save much. So, we're pretty confident on that and I think -- and we think that the numbers are beginning to prove us correct. Amit Mehrotra : If I can just ask one follow-up for Kevin with respect to the cost opportunities you laid out. Kevin, do you expect to see OR improvement in the second half versus the stellar results you guys put up in the second quarter? 3Q typically looks a lot like 2Q, but I'm not sure, if there's any further opportunity given the cost items that you laid out? Kevin Boone : Yes, I think Jim addressed that previously. I don't think we're going to get into back half versus first half dynamics in terms of OR. What I can tell you is there's a number of initiatives that we've been working on over the last month that are new to our plan to react to this downward guidance in our topline. So, yes, we're reacting quickly not only across G&A, it's across all aspects of our business. Jamie, Ed, Bob, and Brian are on Board and new ideas are coming to us everyday. And it\u2019s our job to identify those and go after them, but we're not going to get the nuance of second half versus first half. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. I\u2019ll try, but I appreciate the response. Thanks everybody. Jim Foote : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open. You may ask your question. David Zazula : Hey, this is David Zazula on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a little bit of drill down into the prior question about pricing getting in terms of merchandise versus intermodal. Some of the service metrics you showed on intermodal in terms of trip plan compliance show really good trip plan compliance on the intermodal side. Could that make you potentially a victim of your own success in that -- there's not as much room to grow positive on the service side and try to drive conversion from the truck? Or are there more nuanced aspects of the service that you can still provide that would be beneficial to shippers currently using truck? Jim Foote : I mentioned intermodal versus carload business reflect the major of two different kinds of businesses. The intermodal is terminal-to-terminal, point-to-point and it's much easier to have those high trip plan compliance numbers versus carload. A lot of things we can do there on the terminal side in order to improve that customer experience and I'll have Mark tell you about some of the great stuff we're doing on the technology side on intermodal that we think is going to differentiate ourselves as well. Mark Wallace : Yes. Well, I mean, again across the board I mean, we are -- lots of great things going on across the board with -- in terms of reservation systems all kinds of things that the terminals making it easier for customers to do business with us, whether it's on the website lots of opportunities. But clearly, when we talk about converting a lot of business, merchandise is really where we see the greatness of opportunity. And driving that conversion from truck to our -- into our merchandise business lots of opportunity there. We're seeing some great results. We're converting a lot of business as we speak because of our services improved, so dramatically customers are responding to the reliability and the consistency that we're providing at a great price and so I think there's a lot of opportunities left. But clearly, both on the intermodal side and on the merchandise side there's opportunities for continued growth there. David Zazula : Thanks Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. You may ask your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks, good afternoon. Wanted to ask about the guidance and maybe specifically, can you help us break out what you think the volume expectations are for the back half of the year. I don't know if you want to sort of handle that on a merchandise versus intermodal type of dynamic is clearly there's some company specific initiatives on the intermodal side that are reducing volume, but just any help there to think about that mix of what's yields and what's volume in the back half? Mark Wallace : Chris, I mean, we're expecting that the volume in the second half is going to -- at this point in time is probably -- we're going to have to work really hard to make the volume equal to or better than what we had in the first half. And that's the challenge as I said. Again we came into the year expecting to be up 1% to 2% in the first quarter. But under the circumstances with a lot of noise going on, we still have a pretty good quarter. But there's a lot of the segments especially intermodal just didn't bounce back with the way everybody expected it to be. And so what we\u2019re seeing right now is kind of take today as the run rate. And hopefully, we can do a little bit better than we did in the first half even with the pretty strong quarter. But that's -- we don't have a big hockey stick anymore here, anymore to work with relatively flat, we should get a tick up in the second -- in the fourth quarter of the year, just simply because of intermodal start to over -- we start to get out of some of this -- de-marketing of certain lands. But on an absolute numbers basis, this is pretty much a pretty good -- for planning purposes for our guidance right now and I'm pleased that I hope I'm proven wrong and we do see things that are turning stronger in the later part of the year, but we're just assuming that this is kind of the new norm for guidance purposes. Jim Foote : Hey, Chris, with -- our first half of the year revenue was up 2%. We're now guiding for the full year down 1% to 2%. We still expect pricing to remain positive, so I think the math is pretty simple there. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. And then just on the pricing side and maybe just thinking about yields in general drilling down to the coal numbers, there are some puts and takes. And when export volumes move around a little bit, you tend to have fluctuation in the coal yields. When you think about the back half, should we be looking at 2Q as a reasonably good benchmark to use for the back half or modeling out? Just trying to get a sense of is there other sort of movements between met and thermal that we should expect as we move into the back half of the year. It sounds like the guidance for 40 million tons is still holds, just want to get a sense of if there\u2019s any moving parts within that, is 2Q a good number to use for coal yields? Jim Foote : I think so. I think so, Chris. Listen, again, as you look at the RPUs in coal, as you know in any given quarter always lots of moving parts there. Q2 coal RPUs was down obviously, but that was really a reflection of some gains that we got in shorter haul business and in our utilities business to the north, which is generating lower RPUs than the utility business to the south. And then as I talked about in an earlier question, some of the steel industry growth that we saw, saw some strong volumes there, which is again some lower RPU than typically we see on the whole book of coal. But no, I think, going forward sort of what you see is what you get for and what you should probably think about as we plan out the back half of the year. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, great. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah. Good afternoon. Wanted to ask you first on the -- just kind of broader approach on price and volume. I'm confident you'll show discipline, but how do we think about how you want to dial the -- how you want to approach the dial of the levers. Will you get more aggressive in terms of kind of competitive position to support the volumes as you see this less volume out there? Or is it something where you kind of let the volume flow with the market and you try to keep price that reflects what's good service and discipline and all that? Mark Wallace : So, hey, Tom. We should be, again, Jim mentioned what we're going to do on the volume side and we're going to take it as it comes and we're going to be -- we've got a long pipeline of initiatives of things that I talked about in the past, whether it\u2019s on the marketing side, whether it's on the -- the business that we do with our short-line partners, whether it's stuff that we\u2019re doing on a regional sales, whether it's a whole host of industrial projects -- industrial development projects that we've got going on. I mean, clearly, a long list of initiatives that we're working on, and so we're going to convert that volume as it comes to us and we're working hard everyday to bring more volume under the railroad. But let's be very clear, we're still achieving very strong value on the renewals and the momentum that I spoke about in Q1 on pricing continued into Q2. Every contract that we have it still needs to come across my desk for approval. And I can tell you that I'm extremely pleased with the discipline that our team is bringing. And so we're working hard to pull on both levers, and we're taking a disciplined approach. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks Mark. One other question just how should we think about the operating ratio in an environment -- not necessarily second half of the year, I know you've given us kind of full year commentary. But perhaps, if we look to 2020 and you say well, you are in an environment where revenue is flat. Do you have enough kind of initiatives left? I know Kevin identified some. But do you have enough efficiency gains left to improve the OR if revenue is flat? How might we think about that perhaps from a kind of a broader perspective or 2020 or however you want to frame it? Jim Foote : Well, I think what we just said is, we're going to improve the operating ratio more than a point with revenues down. So, we do -- if we're faced with the similar circumstances, that's the hand we're dealt. We'll do everything in our power to manage the business accordingly. Tom Wadewitz : And you think that could be the case beyond just second half? Jim Foote : Well, that I hoped. Like I said this is not end of days. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, right, right. Jim Foote : Yes. There's a -- again, there\u2019s a certain amount -- obviously, there is a certain amount -- the two variables that -- with two variables, that we obviously need to work with are volume and inflation on the operating side. And to the extent that -- to the extent that we do get some cost reduction associated with volume reductions or increases, if it goes the other way, our challenge each and every year is to offset whatever the inflation number is. And hopefully, if we are providing a high-quality product as Mark said and we're pricing appropriately that should help us a lot to get us going in the right direction from the cost -- which would help on the operating ratio side in addition to keep finding ways to improve efficiency. We have long ways to go and along with the initiatives this work on. We're far -- in all of these various categories, we're far from best-in-class. We like to brag, but we benchmark against it just about everything that everybody else does not even -- not just in the railroad industry to try and figure out where we can improve. But we have a long ways to go and just about every segment of the way we do business. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. Thanks for the perspective, Jim. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may ask your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good afternoon. So, last quarter, I think you talked about headcount being down 6% to 7% this year which would roughly be in line with attrition. Based on the volume weakness you've seen year-to-date and it sounds like you'll see in the second half, what's your flexibility to reduce headcount further? And do you have any updated thoughts around what that percentage looks like in 2019? Jim Foote : Yes. We're still well on-track to meet that forecast that we had the 6% to 8%. I think I mentioned in my opening comments that really overtime is a big focus of ours right now, significant cost and significant savings opportunity going forward. Certainly, we're going to continue to look at headcount, but we're going to use attrition where we can. So, we have a great line of sight to what that number looks like and probably, we'll see -- go a little bit harder there depending on how the volumes come in the back half of the year. Justin Long : Okay. And secondly, I wanted to circle back to domestic intermodal and your expectations for growth on that front. I know it's a little bit noisy with some of the lane rationalizations. But if you can kind of take that out of the equation, what do you see as the underlying growth rate for domestic intermodal as we get into the back half of this year and longer term? Mark Wallace : Well, to tell you what the economy is going to do in the back half of the year, I'll tell you what intermodal is going to do. Listen, I think there's a lot of -- as we talked about the excess supply that's out there, truck supply, capacity, we hopefully are flattish intermodal. We think there's going to be a good peak, but it's probably going to be somewhat muted versus the extremely strong peak that we saw in 2018. So, I think, volume levels are going to pick up a little bit, but probably not as peak issues we saw -- as we have historically seen. Listen, longer term, domestic intermodal, my view is there's no reason why this franchise should not able to grow on an annualized basis whatever GDP gives us plus two or three points. Justin Long : Okay. And just to clarify your comment on flat markets, is that flat domestic intermodal volumes excluding rationalizations in the back half? Is that what you're saying? Jim Foote : No, including our rationalization. So, again, we lap -- officially lap the end of the rationalizations in January of next year. We took off again January of this year of 2019, a 5%. So overall, since we began this journey in December of 2017, we have rationalized over 15% of the intermodal network. Most of that -- a lot of that lapse in October and then the final bit lapse in December -- in January, excuse me. Justin Long : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon guys. Kevin, I don't know if I missed it, but you guys usually give some guidance on the other revenue expectations. Any color you can give us there? Kevin Boone : Yeah, I think you should expect about -- around the current levels that we did in the second quarter, continue through the back half of the year. Scott Group : Okay, helpful. And then so with a more cautious volume revenue outlook, does this change the way you guys think about target leverage ratios? Does it change the way you think about CapEx? I mean, do you some flexibility on the $1.6 billion? And then, I guess just following up on that headcount piece, why not do more on headcount if the volumes are coming in worse? Kevin Boone : I certainly think if we continue to see downward pressure on volumes, which is not our expectation that you probably see some more opportunity there. There is variable cost in our business and then we would take a look at some other things as well. On the balance sheet right now, we're sitting on $1.6 billion in cash. We expect to generate a lot of cash in the second half of the year, kind of, give us significant flexibility to be proactive and opportunistic if the market gives us an opportunity. We're well within our 2.5, 2.75 times leverage targets, debt to EBITDA. I think, we're comfortable living in that area. We're at the bottom end of that today. So it gives us a lot of flexibility going forward. But again, with our cash balance, just we even have today and what we expect to generate through the back half of the year gives a lot of opportunity to be opportunistic here. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you for the time guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird. You may ask your question. Ben, please check your mute feature. Ben Hartford : All right. Guys, sorry about that. Thanks for the time. Mark, I'm interested in your perspective on IMO 2020 and how customer conversations are shaping up in front of that. Do you expect it to have any sort of impact to either in terms of international intermodal pull-forward, anything along the crude or petroleum side of the equation? How are you guys thinking about that impact in the back half of the year and the early part of 2020? Mark Wallace : Yes, a great question. We're obviously working and talking to our customers. I'll be visiting with a lot of the international steamship guys here in the next month or so, where I know that's going to be a huge topic of discussion. We're -- clearly early indications, we don't think it will have a material change for our business. I know they're working on these issues as we speak. But where we stand right now and, again, maybe a little premature, maybe remind me to bring that question back up on the Q3 call and I'll give you maybe a little bit more color. But it's a topic of discussion coming up and -- but clearly, I think, right now we feel pretty comfortable that we're not going to see any material change. Ben Hartford : Okay. That's helpful. And then, the revenue -- or the, excuse me, the outlook you gave on intermodal was helpful. I'm curious on the merchandise side as well. I mean, obviously, a lot of talk about the macro and the softness, but as you guys embark upon expanding the addressable market, what's the probability in 2020 that you can make enough progress, either selling service, developing some of the sales and marketing efforts to be able to drive to whatever U.S. industrial production growth number might be, plus some sort of multiplier within the merchandise category in 2020? Or is that simply too soon? Is it to near of a time horizon to be thinking about and offset yet from some of these initiatives? Mark Wallace : Well, it's a great question. Listen; again, as Jim said earlier, we're outperforming the U.S. rail industry today on our merchandise volume growth. We're up after the second quarter, over 2%. The others are down for the year on merchandise. So, clearly, the initiatives that we're working on, the changes to our service plan and the service that we're delivering are clearly having a lot of big impact. Now we're facing reality and the industrial economy is kind of slowing down here. And we've got a few headwinds going into the second half, which we have to live with. And obviously, PES explosion was a major factor to us revising this. But, as I said earlier, we have a number of initiatives going on and the team that Kevin used to lead in the marketing department before he became an interim CFO here is doing some great work analysis. Those are the -- we got a team of data analytic people downstairs that are doing some great research and exposing a lot of opportunities for this organization. We're excited by that. There's some -- obviously, some big opportunities and we're going after everything methodically and we're looking to grow this organization. We're not just taking what we can get. We\u2019re going out there, we're being proactive and this is about growing CSX, it's not just taking what the customer gives us. We\u2019re going to find opportunities to grow convert truck traffic and we're doing just that. Ben Hartford : Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. You may ask your question. Bascome Majors : Yes. Thanks for taking my question here. You made a few changes in the C-suite in the second quarter. I'm not sure if Farrukh\u2019s in the call, but if he has I was hoping you could help us understand responsibilities of this new role of Strategy Officer and anything about the long-term or mid-term vision that might entail realizing he's six weeks into the job here. And Kevin, anything if you want to highlight your priorities for the finance organization your leadership that will be helpful? Thank you. Kevin Boone : Sure. I've known Farrukh for many, many years, we go way, way back -- all the way back to the privatization of the Canadian National where we worked together on that initiative. At that time we kept up with his career as I moved around the industry as well. So, I just felt that we're embarking on a significant transformation of CSX and a lot of things that we want to do differently, a lot of them in the area that Mark spoke of in terms of expanding our reach and our interface with our customers. And Farrukh instantly came to mind, because I felt that he had a great experience and working in that area. So, it's all about what it is we can do to make our service offering, our core rail product offering better to our customers. And to me that involves a significant amount of new thought, a new direction, a new vision from what has historically been done in the railroad industry and that's what Farrukh is going to work on with me and make it happen. And Kevin, Kevin's phenomenal is doing a great job. We all appreciate that he was here and his skill set and his ability to step right in. And pick up where Frank left off. Frank did an amazing job for CSX and we're all happy that Kevin was here to help as we worked through the transition. And we are -- I am in the process as Kevin well knows. He is looking at the kind of sheepishly as you all know, we\u2019re doing an external search to see if we can find the right person to fill this role and as part of that process, Kevin is going to be considered. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks. Just a little pushing on the intermodal, the trip plan compliance looks really strong. And I'm just wondering the de-marketing is going to lap by the end of the third quarter. So let's just say the economy sort of gets back to a 2.5% GDP type number 2%, 2.5% as we move into 2020. Do you feel comfortable that at that point you\u2019ll be able to start more aggressively re-marketing the intermodal and do that GDP plus two to three points or is it premature? Mark Wallace : As I said, longer term, I think that would be our goal. Clearly, I'm not going to sit here in July of 2019 and provide you 2020 guidance. But longer term, as we think about the intermodal business, yeah that would be my hope and expectation given our franchise, the strength of our franchise, and the service that we provide to customers, which we're pretty proud of, that we would able to do whatever the economy give us plus two to three points above that. So that's my wish, that's my goal, that's we're going to work on. We're settling in on our footprint. We\u2019re doing really well on the lanes that we -- that we're in now. We're showing our customers what we're made of, and when the growth comes we're ready to handle and got excess capacity and we're ready for the growth when it comes. Jordan Alliger : Okay. And then the next question, fully understand the need to be prudent in the guidance with all the various cross currents going on, I think though you might have mentioned in the very opening remarks, Jim that customers remain cautiously optimistic. So, I'm just wondering, which areas might be where that optimism is? And if there optimism plays out and you run that through your system, could we get back to that 1% type of revenue growth if the cautious optimism plays out? Jim Foote : Well, I think yesterday, Jamie once said, they were pretty excited about the second half of the year. I think it was about two weeks ago on the front page of the newspaper, General Motors was talking about how great things were and on and on and on. Not necessarily our customers per se, but I think Jamie Dimon said this morning, it shouldn't stop being so pessimistic, things aren't that bad. All we're doing and saying that there's been -- as I said the slow drip since the beginning of the year, where everyone has expressed concern, I think all of our customers mark interfaces we've done more than I do on a daily basis, and maybe he wants to comment as well, but I think all of them have said from the very beginning, yes, 2019 is expected to be -- was expected to be a slower year than last year, and as he went into the year with all the confusion and chaos more driven by governmental issues than anything. But if we didn't, once government shutdowns you name it on and on and on tariffs, this tariffs that, if we didn't bring the calmness noise down in the marketplace, we could begin to do things to damage the economy. So, and nothing really has changed to make everyone feel different over the first six months. And so, we're looking at, is this the new norm for the rest of the year. Now, we're talking about another government shutdown, maybe as early as September or October. And so, as I said, unfortunately in this day and age, I'm obligated, we're obligated to update guidance when it changed. And we were trying to figure out where to put the peg in. And so we said, let's pretty much take -- let\u2019s assume that what we have today continues for the rest of the year. And let's hope that we're wrong and if things pick up as opposed to say, well, we don't really know, let\u2019s not take a realistic view. We can always just take our guidance down again next quarter. You don't want to get into that situation. So, we think this is a realistic look at the state of the economy and where we fit in. And we're confident with that, plus it gives us the ability internally to say, hey guys, this is the new norm, let\u2019s tighten our shoes, let's get to work and we're going to achieve our targets. Jordan Alliger : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. You may ask your question. David Vernon : Hey, guys. So, the down 1% to 2% for the full year, I'm just trying to get a sense for what that should -- what we should be expecting for sort of operating income dollars, not necessarily the operating ratio. The Street's right now got you up 3% inclusive of land sales, up 6% ex land sales. What kind of EBIT growth on down, sort of, 3% to 4%-ish back half of the year should we be expecting? Kevin Boone : David, as you know the math, if I give you EBIT growth, you would know the OR. So by default, we're going to give the OR ratio into the back half, but probably kind of\u2026 David Vernon : Is it reasonable to expect up a little, down a little, flat? Can you give us some directional guidance on where the EBIT number will be? Kevin Boone : Look, I think we gave the revenue guidance, so we gave an OR target and I think we're going to stick with that for now. We'll obviously update as we get further through the year. David Vernon : All right. And may be just a follow-up. If you look at the sequential downturn in other revenue, was that just like changing the rules on when you're charging demurrage, because the volume was sequentially flat in the intermodal now, which was called out in the report, I'm just trying to get a sense for what drove that sort of sequential move lower in the other revenue. Kevin Boone : Well, the intermodal volumes are down 10%. There's a lot less boxes sitting in terminals and we're charging a lot less and certainly local as we told everybody before, accessorial charges are something that we're not looking to make a lot of money there. It's really changing customer behaviors and getting boxes to flow and assets to move throughout the network. And so, some of that is working and we're working with our customers and we're seeing some good dwell numbers. And so, we're happy with where that's trending. But obviously, a lot of that was driven by just lower intermodal volumes. David Vernon : But the volumes from 1Q to 2Q were flat? Kevin Boone : Pardon me? David Vernon : The 1Q to 2Q, the sequential volume was kind of flattish and you\u2019re going from like 168 to 124, I was just trying to understand, did you see a really big pickup in the yard performance or was this just\u2026 Kevin Boone : This is -- most of this is international intermodal and this is where these kinds of the guys have said, they can't have offsite storage. They must store their box in our terminal. Well guess what, when you start charging them suddenly they find ways and they move their boxes to container storage facilities located near our intermodal terminals. That's just the nature of the beast. So, yeah, volume on the international side was -- overall volume was down in intermodal, volume on international side was relatively flat, but to be a customer behavior that Mark just alluded to, these are the first guy to take advantage of that and get him out of it. David Vernon : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen. You may ask your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Jim and team thanks for squeezing me in here. I just got -- I have one question. Looking out in intermodal obviously you guys de-marketed some of the business, because there wasn't enough on some of the lines and the profitability just wasn't there. It's clearly important to raise the profitability of intermodal. How much of that is improving service and how much of that is going to be -- you guys going after higher prices? Mark Wallace : Yes. A lot of the work that we're working on right now is changing the footprint and working on taking out all the unnecessary touches and switching that we used to do with intermodal that was crazy changing this hub and spoke system that we inherited when we joined the railroad, which caused a lot of inefficiencies in the -- in our intermodal product and in our service and drove up our intermodal cost significantly. And so, we have changed that model. We have gotten out of a lot of the lanes that were clearly very unprofitable for us. We're focusing on what we do well and the lanes that we do well in our in our contracts, we have a longer term contract. So, it's not -- we're not susceptible to the very well sort of mid to high to single-digit exposure to the spot market. So, doesn't really affect us too much. But most of our pricing is under a long-term contracts with rate escalators, so annual rates escalator. But we're working there and we're doing a good job and we're going to see the profitability of that business segment improve over time. Jason Seidl : Okay. Thanks for the time as always. Jim Foote : All right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Walter Spracklin : Yes. Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone I'll keep it to one as well just again on the intermodal side and your effort. I think Mark you were saying targeting trucking your one of your peers obviously in Canada is taking a little different approach to that. They're not only targeting the trucking market, but investing in and buying intermodal assets within that market to kind of jump start and accelerate that conversion that truck-to-rail conversion. Is that something you would consider? Is that something you've looked at? What's your overall view on that strategy? Mark Wallace : I think they're smart people. Jim and I know them really well. Obviously, it's got a lot of my career at the railroad. I admire what they're doing. We have a little bit of a different model here in the United States than up north. But we look at what they're doing and -- but I'm not just here with you on the call today strategies for the future. But listen we as Jim alluded to we're looking for growth opportunities everywhere, whether that's in merchandise, whether that's an intermodal and you never say never to any opportunity that comes across your desk. Jim Foote : Keep looking at it. We're watching what they're doing. Mark Wallace : Yes. Walter Spracklin : Fair enough. So, maybe if I could sneak one in there as well an extra one R&D, Mark again you mentioned that technology I think the rail industry is right for it. Can we see or do you expect to see perhaps -- this is better for Jim perhaps more of your CapEx dollars going toward potential investment in accelerating the R&D applicability to rail to get some of those extra efficiencies from that trend. Just curious your thoughts on that? Kevin Boone : Hey, this is Kevin. First of all, tech dollars are up this year, so we are spending is more on CapEx technology, but I'll let Jim answer the rest of the question. Jim Foote : Well, again, it\u2019s something we're always looking at ways to -- we're here to grow the business simple as that. This is not despite what a lot of people say, they're not -- you guys and a lot of people say, we're here to shrink the business to profitability. We're here to make the business to run better so that we can grow it and we'll look at every opportunity where we can make a buck and make in the process, and make the shareholders rich and famous. And that's what it's all about. So we're always studying every opportunity that we can pursue. Walter Spracklin : Okay. That's it. Thank you very much. Jim Foote : Great. Thank you very much for calling us. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I turn the call back over to the speakers. Jim Foote : Thank you everyone for joining us. I think that concludes our call. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call. You may disconnect your lines.",

During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Slater, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. Bill Slater : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today\u2019s call is Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Kevin Boone, Chief Financial Officer; and Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations On slide two is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on slide three. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim Foote : Good afternoon and thank you Bill. Before we begin the presentation, I'd like to first congratulate the over 21,000 strong CSX workforce for a great job in delivering a really good quarter. They again shown that they are the safest, most customer focused and best operators in the industry. Breaking their own record with an all-time low operating ratio for U.S. Class I railroad of 56.8% was no easy task. So hats off to all of them. I\u2019d also like to mention several recent leadership announcements beginning with the appointment of Kevin Boone to Chief Financial Officer and Jamie Boychuk to Executive Vice President of Operations. Both Kevin and Jamie are skilled leaders who have played a big roles in this company's transformation and are excellent additions to our executive team. I'm very pleased that Ed Harris will remain a key part of the executive team as we drive hard to get even better. CSX is lucky to have both Ed and Jamie, two of the best operators in our business. We also announced changes in sales and marketing as Mark builds a new team that is intensely focused on identifying and capitalizing on opportunities to grow the top line. Adam Longson recently joined as Vice President of Energy. Adam's deep knowledge of the commodity market is a valuable addition. The recent appointments of Farrukh Bezar as Senior Vice President of Marketing and Arthur Adams as Vice President, Merchandise Sales demonstrates our commitment to working with our merchandise customers to find new and creative ways to first add value to our customers, which will then drive long-term profitable growth. CSX service has never been this good. Now it's the time to harvest the opportunities. With that, let's turn to presentation beginning with slide five in our financial results. The third quarter results are straightforward with only a few unique items, which Kevin will point out. Third quarter EPS increased 3% to $1.08 versus last year's figure of $1.05. Our third quarter operating ratio improved by 190 basis points to as I said a new record of 56.8%. Turning to slide six, our improved services is driving industry-leading merchandise volumes as customers continue to trust CSX with the greater share of their freight. Despite the softer industrial economy merchandise volumes held flat. However, the strength in merchandise was offset by declines in coal, intermodal, and other revenue resulting in a 5% decline in total revenue to $3 billion. I'm encouraged by the performance of a merchandise franchise had it not been for the Philadelphia refinery explosion at the end of June, merchandise volumes would have been up approximately 2% for the quarter versus declining industry volumes. In total, merchandise revenue increased 1% on flat volumes as pricing gains were partially offset by mixed headwinds. Intermodal declined -- revenue declined 11%, a 9% lower volumes, much of this associated with an impact of lane rationalizations implemented last fall and early this year. We have now left the first round of lane rationalizations final 5% of rationalizations at the beginning of next year. Coal revenue decreased 12%, a 9% lower volumes with declines in both domestic and export markets due to lower natural gas prices and weaker export demand and lower benchmark prices. Finally, the decrease in other revenues was primarily driven by lower storage revenue at intermodal facilities and demurrage charges. Moving on to slide seven, I'm pleased with the continued positive momentum in our safety performance. Our FRA personal injury rate was again the best in the industry and we further improved last quarter's record FRA train accident results to set new company records for both fewer train accidents and the lowest accident rate. We still have opportunities to improve. Technologies such as the increased use of automated track inspection cars and drones are helping to identify small problems before they become big issues and are also help -- improving our day-to-day execution across the network. We constantly strive to make the railroad as safe as it can be. Moving to slide eight, let's quickly review our operating performance. Velocity improved both sequentially and year-over-year. Dwell increased slightly for the quarter, but we see opportunities to improve this metric going forward. We also set another fuel efficiency record. CSX is the only U.S. Class I road to operate below one gallon of fuel per thousand gross ton miles. Not only does this reduce cost, but the environmental impact of this is significant. This has been partially enabled by the increased use of distributed power which has been a focus of the operating team. This technology which CSX had historically not deployed allows us to disperse locomotives throughout the train which improves fuel efficiency and enhances safety and reliability by reducing train separations. For the quarter, we averaged 87 distributed power trains per day, but we frequently operate with over 100. On slide nine, most importantly, as we focus on running a better railroad, we are creating better service for our customers. We continue to improve trip plan compliance figures for both carload and intermodal customers with 75% of merchandise cars and 94% of intermodal containers pinning their hourly trip plan targets, both new quarterly records We're not providing individualized real-time trip plan tracking to our intermodal customers and will be rolling that information out to merchandise customers in the fourth quarter. These new tools again differentiates CSX from other rails and our customers are very excited about the tool. I'll now hand it over to Kevin who will take you through the financials. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Jim. Before I get started I want to thank Jim and the Board for their support and confidence. I'm excited to continue work with this great team. Turning to slide 11, I'll walk you through the highlights of the summary income statement. As Jim mentioned, total revenue was down 5% in the third quarter as the impact of intermodal and coal headwinds, as well as lower fuel recoveries and other revenue more than offset the benefit of pricing gains across nearly all markets. Expenses declined 8% year-over-year, really a great performance. The team continues to drive efficiency across all areas of our business. Overall, third quarter expense results reflect the company sustained operating improvements, a significant progress in labor and asset efficiency. Before running through the expense line items, I want to note a couple of unique items in the quarter, including a $22 million impairment related to an intermodal terminal sale agreement and a net headwind of $15 million related to state fuel tax matters. These two items totaling $37 million impacted MS&O and fuel expense respectively. Real estate saw $65 million in gains this quarter, an increase of $12 million year-over-year. We continue to see a pipeline of real estate opportunities though the impact of these transactions will remain uneven from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Labor and trends expenses were 8% lower with average headcount down 6%. Our ongoing refinement of the operating plan continues to drive savings from fewer crude starts enabling a 9% year-over-year reduction in active train and engine employee base and driving a 6% improvement in crude utilization as measured by gross ton miles per active train and engine employee. Seeing an overtime and released our coal also down 12% and 77% respectively as we operate more efficiently. As I mentioned on the second quarter call overtime is a strong focus area across all operating departments, through workforce efficiency and management execution we reduced overtime across all operating departments by nearly 14% sequentially. Additionally the active locomotive count was down 11% year-over-year in the quarter. The smaller fleet combined with fewer cars online and freight car repair efficiencies helped drive an 8% year-over-year reduction in our mechanical workforce. Also while velocity on-time originations and on-time arrivals improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter, Jamie and operating team are confident to remain additional opportunity -- to continue to improve train speed and dwell which further deliver cost savings. MS&O expense improved 12% or $59 million versus the prior year driven by efficiency and operations to forecast and savings related to lower volumes. We continue to see efficiencies attributable to lower active locomotive count, driving savings in locomotives materials and maintenance cost. Freight car repair cost was also lower driven by significantly fewer train accidents in the quarter. In addition we're intensely focused on driving engineering efficiency. This led to significant savings in the third quarter on materials, travel, vehicles and outside services. Our continued train plan refinements also drove savings in crude travel and repositioning expenses, which were down 10% year-over-year. Fuel expense was down $45 million or 17% year-over-year in the quarter. These savings were driven by a 13% decrease in the per gallon price, record efficiency and lower volume. Our focus on utilization of distributed power and energy management software combined with train handing rules compliance drove another quarter of record fuel efficiency. As I know noted earlier, there was also a unique item related to the state fuel tax matters that had an $15 million unfavorable impact on the quarter. Looking at other expenses. Depreciation increased 1% due to the impact of larger net asset base. Going forward, we expect a sequential increase of approximately $15 million to depreciation in the fourth quarter, mainly related to group-life depreciation study on equipment assets that occurs every three years. Whilst this is associated with previous asset sales are amortized over the life of the remaining assets. This obviously has no impact of free cash flow. Equipment rents expense increased 17% as the impact of inflation and other items more than offset the benefit of lower volume related cost and efficiency gains. As we reduced well and improved days per load, we should see further improvement. Equity earnings increased $3 million in the quarter due to higher net earnings at our affiliates. Looking below the line, interest expense increased primarily due to higher average debt balances. Income tax expense increased $13 million, primarily due to cycling of 2018 benefits related to the settling of state tax matters. Absent unique items, we would expect an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5% going forward. Closing out the P&L, as Jim highlighted in his opening remarks, CSX delivered nearly $1.3 billion of operating income in the third quarter in line with 2018, despite of weaker volume environment. We also delivered a record operating ratio of 58.6% \u2013 56.8%, an improvement of 190 basis points and earnings per share of $1.08, representing a 3% improvement over third quarter 2018. Turning to the cash flow side of the equation on slide 12, we continue to invest in our core track infrastructure to provide safe and reliable train operations. Year-to-date, capital investment is down $49 million or 4% year-over-year. Overall, our reduced asset intensity has enabled us to sustain lower levels of capital investment without compromising safety or reliability. The level of PTC spending has also come down significantly in the last two years. Free cash flow remains a focus for this team, generating operating improvement while driving better capital efficiency has produced differentiated free cash flow growth. Growth in CSX's core operating cash flow generation including improvements in working capital drove a 15% increase in adjusted free cash flow to $2.8 billion through the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly 3.4 billion to shareholders, including approximately 2.8 billion in buybacks and 600 million in dividends. Dividend payments in the quarter reflect a 9% increase from $0.22 to $0.24 per share we announced in February this year, net of the lower share count. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Foote : Great. Thank you, Kevin. Turning to slide 14, let's wrap this up by reviewing our outlook for the year. Freight demand is generally in line with the expectations set out at the end of last quarter when we adjusted our forecast to reflect what we felt was a realistic view of softer underlying economic activity. Nothing in the industrial economy has really changed since then. Despite the swing from a plus 1% to 2% growth in environment to a down 1% to 2% environment, we are maintaining our full year operating ratio guidance of below 60% and we are still on course for record operating cash flow. These are impressive accomplishments. We have fundamentally changed CSX over the last two years, not just in how the company operates but also the way we approach our business and our customers. We are encouraged by our customers' positive response to our improved service and are working tirelessly to find innovative new ways to better serve their needs. Despite the significant progress made to date, we are still \u2013 there are still meaningful opportunities to operate more efficiently and reliably as we move towards our goal of being the best run railroad in North America. Thank you and I'll turn it back to Bill. Bill Slater : Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time, I would ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up only if necessary. With that, we will now take questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi Research. Your line is open. Chris Wetherbee : Great. Thanks, good afternoon guys. Maybe we start on the OR, obviously, significant progress here yet again in spite of meaningful volume declines. I guess when you think about the outlook; maybe if you can go beyond the near-term target of sub-60 and the efficiency and other opportunities that you highlighted are still on the table. How can we start thinking about things, I guess maybe putting your head on for 2020 and thinking about what the world may look like, is this going to be more of returned to volume and little bit less operating ratio if you think about 2020, or maybe a little bit more operating ratio just want to get a sense of how you're thinking about guiding the business into 2020, which hopefully has more stable volume outlook. Jim Foote : Hi Chris. Well, first of all we're not going to get into 2020 just yet. We'll ramp up the fourth quarter here and then we'll start trying to give guidance as to what 2020 is going to look like. I guess only just two general comments and then either may be Kevin or Mark want to jump in with some additional commentary, but just two general comments. It's difficult still very, very difficult to gauge where the overall economy is going. I think we feel very confident for the fourth -- or confident for the fourth quarter as we call what we thought was a pretty soft outlook going forward and so we're going to have to wait to see to start figuring out what the revenue is going to look like next year. But again generally speaking, our plan is to grow this business and to the extent that we can grow this business we're going to do it. And then secondly, our plan is to run this company as efficiently as we possibly can and we're going to continue to focus on them. So this is not a \u2013 they are not mutually exclusive. We're going to do both at the same time and that's what we've been showing we can do this year. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That's very helpful. If you allow me a quick follow-up sort of along these lines. You made some changes within some of the sales positions of the business and that seems like merchandise of the future potentially big opportunity for you as you move forward. Can you talk a little bit about sort of the opportunities that you see maybe put some sizing around some of them as we move forward 2020 and beyond? Just trying to get a sense of what you see the opportunity for CSX to merchandise? Mark Wallace : Sure Chris. It's Mark. This is not something, this is new. We've been talking about this for quite some time now. As we look at the future of this business we see huge opportunity in our merchandise segment, its two-third of our business. I think you know going back quarter two when we initially put Kevin as the Head of the Marketing. We highlighted the fact that we were going to grow our Marketing Department because initially CSX did not have one, traditional marketing department. Kevin did a great job in a short term that he was there of bringing in some people both externally and internally. Looking at some things differently and focusing on growth. We've now with some additions moved Farrukh over as Senior VP of Strategy into the Head of Marketing Department, so he's going to carry on and as we split out the sales and marketing roles from a lot of our Directors. Some people used to wear dual-headed hats. Now we\u2019ve got Directors of Sales and in Farrukh Group we've got Directors of Marketing. And so as Jim said in his opening remarks, an intense focus on the marketing -- on the merchandise sector. Clearly we look at the size of the opportunity in the North American spend for transportation every year. There is a lot of truck volume out there. And we believe that by renewing our focus on the merchandise segment and looking for truck conversion opportunities that we're going to go and capture that market share. So a huge focus for us going forward and we're pretty excited by the work that's already been started. Chris Wetherbee : Got it. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : And our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good afternoon. Good job on the hour during the quarter. I wanted to ask about the coal yield is based; they seem to have held up a little bit better sequentially than I would have expected given the export benchmarks. So maybe if you could talk about the mix trends within the segment and the quarter and compare that to what you saw in the second quarter and then if you could just maybe comment on how we should be thinking about Q4? Jim Foote : Let me highlight the mix, Allison. We get the mix question. So let me address that overall and we can get into coal if you want. But overall, we experienced a negative mix within most of our business segments this quarter. And as I talked about many, many times and as usual as you see within each business segment and again in coal there was always ups and downs between the commodities that holds different RPUs. And we'll continue to see these mix issues quarter-over-quarter. And I don't -- we don't manage the business to solve for how mix falls in any given quarter and we're focused on delivering long-term sustainable growth. But clearly on the coal side, we did have a negative mix on coal. Lot of that was a shorter haul business to some utilities in the north. I think that was a phenomenal we saw in the second quarter and we also had growth some growth to some shorter haul growth to mobile and the mines in Alabama, so -- and less going export as the export volumes were impacted by the benchmarks. So, as I said a lot of mix issues going in overall in each of the commodities, but again in coal just given the decline in some of the longer haul exports, and then we picked up some shorter haul utility business. So that phenomenon continued. Allison Landry : Okay. Perfect. And do you have any thoughts on Q4 just given the one quarter look back and the benchmark for that? Jim Foote : Well, I'll tell you. Q3, I would say that export, the met side, which again is two-thirds of our export coal. The business was soft, but the global steel markets continue to weaken with the industrial slowdown and some of the sourcing issues in Europe in fact, obviously, the benchmark prices. As you know the majority of our contracts re-price quarterly. So in Q3 we were less impacted by price, because the price of the export in Q2 were relatively strong. But as we moved into Q4 and given where the benchmarks were in Q3 and where they are today with about $150, clearly there's going to be some RPU impact in Q4. Allison Landry : Perfect. Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Todd Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is open. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah, good afternoon. It\u2019s Tom. I wanted to ask you on the overtime initiatives, Kevin it sounds like you're getting a lot of traction on that pretty quickly, which is great. I wanted to see if you could give us kind of a ballpark of maybe on an annual basis, how large is the opportunity for cost savings from reduced overtime. Is it $50 million? Is it just some kind of a ballpark for that and perhaps how much of that you would have captured on run rate basis in the third quarter? Jim Foote : Yeah. We have again real specific, but it\u2019s not single million digits, it\u2019s tens of millions of dollars that we executed across mechanical engineering and the T&E employees on the field. So it's a large opportunity for us still going forward where we've just began and I'm sure Jamie could talk more to -- all the efforts that we've -- we started probably in the late second quarter as we saw some of the volumes come down and started to focus on this item. Kevin Boone : Yeah. So one of the -- obviously, what we really seen some good attraction is on that engineering and mechanical side, we have seen some traction on the transportation, but that's where our bigger opportunity is and as the team spends time out in the field visiting locations and continuing to look for opportunities that's one of the larger opportunities that we see out there table out there still left on the table going forward. Kevin Boone : But Tom going back to the magnitude of the size, I think previously I mentioned in many categories were 30% plus over time as the percent of trade times, so the opportunity is still pretty significant there. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. And then I guess a related question to that in the per worker comp and benefits in the quarter were a little bit lower than we expected, down about 2% year-over-year. Was that primarily a function of lower overtime? Was there something going on that incentive comp or something else, is that something we should model in fourth quarter in terms of lower per worker cost. Jim Foote : I would say with combination I think you got it right. You know certainly overtime played a factor in that. You did see some -- slightly lower incentive comp year-over-year as well. We'll continue on the good trend here going forward. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. Thanks for the time and good quarter. Jim Foote : Thanks Tom. Operator : Thank you. The next call comes from Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Ken Hoexter : Hey great. Good afternoon and congrats on a solid operating ratio. Great to see. Jim may be just your thoughts on if you see -- you mentioned that kind of nothing has changed in the outlook, but maybe get a little bit more specific if there is anything shifting in particular coal, metals, fertilizers taking a step down, is there anything in the market that you look out that alters your view as you look out? Jim Foote : No. All of the external metrics to try and get a sense for where the business is going have seemed to somewhat stabilize at this lower softer numbers. It -- my personal opinion is, it took a while for them to get them there and if they're going to turn round, it's going to take a while for them to turn back up and while there is some sense -- more sense to-date of optimism than maybe there was 10 days ago, these metrics and these numbers are not going to turnaround in a couple of weeks. So we see this kind of slow growth environment throughout the quarter And as we get nearer to the end of the year hopefully, we can see -- have a little more light shown on the pathway beyond the end of this year and will be in a better to opine on it. Ken Hoexter : I appreciate that. And I guess for my follow-up then, since you're sticking with your 60 -- sub-60 OR are you somewhat indicating step up in hard fourth quarter margin or any reason you are not taking it down just given the run rate for the three quarters which is sub-58, yet you're not going to a sub-59 or even out of 58. Are you indicating something is going to happen in the fourth quarter or just being keeping a high number as of easy boogie? Jim Foote : When we were in New York a couple of -- about 18 ago Ken we said we're going to get was 60 in 2020, I didn't hear you say, boy that\u2019s an easy question. So yes, we're going to get to our target and we said we'd beat our target a year early and clearly had not put in our plan, this kind of softening in the overall economy not only in the U.S. but globally impacting all of our business units you know kind of one onetime. So we're kind of are we being cautious? No, I think we're being \u2013 we have the same realistic viewpoint of the economy to-date that we had three months ago when we told everybody we even see a hockey stick coming into the second half of the year in terms of growth. And we also have, you know what is traditionally the fourth quarter from a seasonality perspective, we expect similar kinds of behavior on the cost side this year. So that's just -- I think a realistic assumption as we always do. We hope we do better than that, but putting to say that we\u2019re going to have an annual operating ratio below 60 this year is a pretty good achievement in a difficult time. Ken Hoexter : This year, three quarters in and you're already at 58. So it just seems like -- I didn\u2019t know if you were sending a signal that you expected deterioration in fourth quarter beyond normal. But I appreciate the insight. Thanks, Jim. Jim Foote : All right. Operator : The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks operator. By the way congrats Kevin and Jamie on the new appointments, well deserved. I wanted to ask question about the operating ratio shockingly and just the company's ability to maintain or grow profits in a down revenue environment, because this is supposed to be a business with theoretically high incrementals and decrementals with capital intensive business. So, I'm just trying to understand how much one way you have on the cost and efficiency side, because you decided to put that in extra this time on the looking \u2013 the forward looking slide. So, I'm just trying to understand, how much room there is on the cost and efficiency side that's going to allow you to continue to hold the line on profits or grow profits on a year-over-year basis in an environment where revenue continues to be challenging or down? Jim Foote : Well, I had clarifications, so I can answer the question correctly. I think our slide in terms of what we're talking about in terms of efficiency and operating ratio is the exact slide that we used three months ago and I think that\u2019s the exact slide we used the quarter before that. Amit Mehrotra : Well, unless I'm mistaken, I think you added significant remaining opportunities to further improve. I\u2019m mean, we\u2019re not picking here, but I think you added another bullet regarding efficiencies and service and efficient further improvement there? Jim Foote : Well, look I said, we're always trying to get better and we believe there\u2019s a lot of opportunity out there for us to continue to get better. It will be hell of a lot better \u2013 easier to get to a better number with a little bit more robust economic environment. So we're going to continue to always focus on efficiency and running the road in the best we possibly can, and we believe that there are many, many opportunities out there for us to continue to do that. And I don't think that's anything different than I\u2019ve ever said before in comments in terms of other opportunities. Yeah, there might be a little more difficult to find, identify and execute on. But there are always tons of opportunities out there for us to get better. We've always believe that, we've always been optimistic and bold in our positions where we thought we could take the company and I don't think anything has really changed. Amit Mehrotra : So would you be -- Jim, would you be -- I'm just trying to understand this as the follow-up to this question, as you look out over the next 12 months, I know you're not talking about 2020, but just conceptually given the opportunity you see on the cost side, could revenues -- if revenues are flat to down next year, do you think you could see year-on-year improvement in 2020? Jim Foote : Well, again we'll give you some more solid view of that at the end of the quarter, aspirationally do I think that with this team can repeat the fantastic job they did this year with revenues, again as I said in my comments, we started the year thinking revenues are going to be up, you know as much as 2% and now we're saying the revenues could be down as much as 2% and for us to have delivered this operating 56 or something operating ratio was nothing -- short of amazing. And I am -- this group going to accept the challenge to try to do the same thing again next year. I certainly hope so, but in terms of putting into book and saying that's our forecast we're going to wait three months before we make that kind of bold statement. Amit Mehrotra : Yes that's very fair. But my second question is on pricing environment. When I just look at revenue per RTM kind of adjusted for other income and that\u2019s your -- it continues to moderate and I know it's not a perfect metric to proxy for pricing because there is a lot of stuff that goes into it especially mix. But can you just talk about kind of, when we should see revenue per RTM, what is that a proxy for and can we extrapolate that into the overall pricing environment, just making it harder to get pricing and the volume environment. Any comments there would be helpful. Jim Foote : Yes, I mean, I won't repeat what I told out and when I talked about the mix, clearly that has a significant impact on the revenue for us again. But let me address the pricing growth because I used to get this question on price and let me be crystal clear here, we're not sacrificing volume for price or price for volume. And within the merchandise and Intermodal, our same-store sales pricing in Q3 was the strongest that we have seen in the past three years and all our contracts that come up for renewal in the quarter, we exceeded our same-store sales pricing. So -- and we're going to continue to price to the value of the business and price to the value of the service that we provide. And -- but again, RPU and then the revenue for RTM you're always going to see these mix issues. But don't read into it that it's a pricing issue. We're still continuing to generate the best price for the value of our product. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys and congrats on the great results. Appreciate it. Jim Foote : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is open. Brandon Oglenski : Good afternoon everyone and congrats Kevin and Jamie, well deserved. So Jim maybe just to clarify, I think some investors have gotten really focused on maybe more glossy 'PSR' presentations that of your competitors and maybe the common thought here is that, CSX really has nothing more to go on precision schedule already. So maybe in that context you guys have headcount down roughly in line with this, I think you are sticking with that. Should we be thinking that when we give to back to a growth environment there's still more to go on the cost side or can you scale into this new level of cost with a lot more growth? I guess how can you help us on that line? Jim Foote : Well yes we don\u2019t have good floating. But we're working out making that appearance especially whenever we can. What we're doing is, yes I mean, we're responding to a softer environment and are looking for every opportunity we can, where we don\u2019t enter services directly. And what we're doing here is that, we're building an enormous amount of operating leverage into this organization. So when the economy begins to turn around and we begin to see a slight uptick in a better environment to work in, we're going to see the impact of that leverage and we're not going to \u2013 we have tons \u2013 the way we run the company today has created a tremendous amount of potential world opportunity for us on the capital side, one because we freed up a tremendous amount of capacity because the way we run the railroad today and we said many times we could probably with 30% growth into the organization without adding any additional capital and the same is true on the operating side. We got capacity on our existing trains today where we can put a lot of growth on the railroad incrementally and not have to start adding that expenses. And so both from a cash perspective and an operating perspective, I think we\u2019re well-positioned to perform well in either direction either a soft environment or in a strong environment. Brandon Oglenski : Appreciate Jim. I\u2019ll keep it to one. Jim Foote : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Brian Ossenbeck : Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. First one just wanted to follow-up on the extra capacity. It seems -- Mark, what are you thinking in terms of some of the bigger chunks of truck food conversion, how some of the larger shippers and maybe some industry has received better service, the better tools, increased visibility, how \u2013 what you sense is to when you can start to make some of those conversions even at a smaller scale? Jim Foote : Brian we're seeing it today, we're seeing it every day. I would say, I\u2019m blessed and my team is blessed, the work that Ed and Jamie and their teams have done. Jamie deserves to be sitting today at this table today and the work that he\u2019s done over the last 2.5 years to really give us the service product that my team now has the ability to grow and sell, and we think we\u2019ll tap into the truck conversion opportunities that this franchise has never been able to go after in the past is exciting. And so we're seeing those truck conversions today. We're seeing it across the board or across our merchandising segments, large things to talk about right now, but we're seeing incremental volumes from existing customers day in and day out, we're talking to customers who may be used to shipped by rail but because of the poor service that they experienced over the last couple of decades abandoned rails and I've been using truck ever since, those are the kind of shippers that we're talking to, and we're penetrating that -- those markets and that business and we're being successful. And we're also on the technology side, Jim mentioned in his opening, trip plan compliance is a huge, huge game changer for our customers. They now and as we said we roll this out for intermodal on October 1st and our merchandise customers will see trip plan compliance visibility, December 1 on ship CSX. This is a game changer for them. They will see every car that they ship on CSX in every lane in our performance against the trip plans we rolled this out a couple weeks ago in our customer engagement forum and I can tell you customers are excited. So, we've got great visibility into their service, no other railroad is doing this. We're blessed with the great service that we\u2019ve got that the operating team has worked very hard to deliver to us. And so right now it's for us to go out and identify those opportunities and convert them with the new teams that have been placed here over the past week. Brian Ossenbeck : Thanks Mark. I appreciate all the details there. Kevin maybe a quick housekeeping for you the \u2013 the revenue line continues to down for the reasons you mentioned on the merge in the storage. Is this the current run rate that you expect for the rest of this year? And just wondering, as shippers sort of figure out what to do with the new operating models that are being rolled out through the U.S., do you think the states emerge in general if you think it's been structurally higher is some different issue than just the storage as part of comps are been dismissed or you think eventually goes back where it was\u2026 Jim Foote : Yeah I think -- look I think we told you expected it to come down as it was kind of trended in that direction. In terms of the run rate going forward somewhere between the second quarter run rate and the third quarter is probably where we will end and so $110 million to $120 million range is probably the new normal unless something dramatically changes from here. I might let Mark talk to the additional opportunities, but now look it's -- you know, I think we expected this you know without something meaningfully changing from here probably at the same run rates. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Group : Hey thanks. Afternoon guys. So I want to ask the productivity question maybe a little bit more directly. Do you think you can do another mid-single-digit reduction in headcount from here? And then does a 57 OR with revenue down five give you more confidence that ultimately you can run this business not next year but longer term, it -- closer to mid-50s or if you're growing revenue? Kevin Boone : Scott, this is Kevin. Look, I know the focus has been on headcount I know, you know, we report headcount numbers every quarter. Labor represents roughly 35% of our cost base. There's a lot of other costs to go out there as well. You know, we're looking at those. I think you saw great improvement in MS&O which is a huge cost line item for us. There's other ways to reduce costs than pure headcount reductions that we talked about over time, it's a huge, huge category for us. So we're getting -- there's a lot of other areas for us to go after that, than just simply headcount. But you know if -- if the volumes continue to be challenging, we'll look for new ways to drive costs down. You know we run faster and take down dwell -- the assets drop out and the cost goes down significantly, so we'll look at every way to go out, go after these costs. Scott Group : In the OR more broadly? Jim Foote : Sorry. Scott, again we're not going to get into 2020, you know, as we've said, We think we have opportunities to continue to improve on the efficiency side, we said that we would improve on efficiency in a good environment \u2013 and in a bad environment, when we started the year and we've done it. Some people didn't think we could, but we've already shown the world that you know there's no, there's no limit to what hard work and ingenuity can produce. Scott Group : Okay. That's fair. And just, Jim just one other it's been a busy three months in Washington with rate case proposals and proposals and the lawsuits from you guys on one-man crews, may be just give us a lay of the land as you\u2019d see in DC and any other proposals from the board or real concern, your thought maybe just some color on this lawsuit on the 1% crews, just DC broadly as you see it? Jim Foote : I would now want to bet on open mic and let you know what my real thoughts are about what's going on in Washington DC. So I\u2019ll just stick with what's going on in STB. The STB after a number of years is not being like really fully staffed, you're stepping up and taking care of some issues that have been lingering out there for a long time, and I think that they are just doing their job and they put forward some suggestions, which have been kicked around for long times and turns, is there a way to change, simplify, modify some of the procedural steps that shippers have to go through if they have complaints. And I think the industry we have thoughts on what they want to talk about, rest of the industry does as well and I think we'll work through all of that in due course and it's similarly trying to begin to have some discussions at least about what revenue adequacy might be that\u2019s a long-term process. So I just think that the STB is kind of work \u2013 back to work and being in a business in an industry that's regular, just work with regulator in due course. So I'm not freaked out about anything that's going out in there. And we're starting \u2013 your comments about litigation over labor negotiations, we\u2019re just now starting a long process to begin the new round of industry-wide bargaining and everybody starts out trying to posture and get themselves in the right position. And so again nothing out of the normal course of business there. So I think it's just business as usual and we'll continue to remain vigilant and active in that area. But I said nascent to DC, I\u2019d try not to go there unless I absolutely have to. Scott Group : Thanks for your time guys. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird. Your line is open. Ben Hartford : Good evening guys. Jamie, maybe just some perspective on your view, looking into 2020 from an ops perspective. It was core good progress on train velocity improvement but 12 hours were flat. Any specific projects into 2020 that you have on the horizon that you think can really in fact changed particularly on the dual hour\u2019s side. I mean, maybe talk us through how do you see the next 12 months progressing from an operations point of view? Thanks. Jim Foote : Yeah for sure. Thanks for the question Ben. The operating team is completely focused on controlling costs, providing the best services as Mark mentioned, and not only providing best service but doing it safely. So as we continue to assess the market conditions and making sure that we're nimble enough to make the moves that we need to heading into next quarters, we are getting out there and operating in few months, has been able to work really close with the guys over the last couple of years and developed a fantastic team of railroaders out there. And to your point dwell is one of those metrics that isn't where we wanted to be particularly on the network side of dwell and that comes along with -- and is a big expense that we want to continue to work towards going into the next few quarters and just getting out of the field, leading out there, traveling with the guys. I've spent the past couple of years really performing most of my work -- lot of my work here in the network center with the team now we're kind of spreading our wings again now they're working with those -- the operating guys on the ground and making sure that the team is taking a look at every opportunity we have out there to continue to bring those costs where they need to be. But ultimately this is providing the best service we can and given marketing team of product being there and continue to sell while we continue to drop those costs? Ben Hartford : Any notable projects on the mid-horizon or is this going to be kind of iterative from here forward? Jim Foote : Look there is a lot of projects out there with respect to getting out as I mentioned getting out of the ground trying every -- minimum every two weeks taking a few -- flying into different terminals. Last week we made a trip over to St. Louis unannounced, sat down with the operating team and came up with some ideas on how we can move cars quicker faster and reduce headcount. So those opportunities are what we're going to continue to push and drive forward. The Senior Vice President's Bob Frulla and Brian Barr are traveling with me out there and we're finding the external talent we have -- sorry internal talent we have within our company and moving as quick as we can and well sufficient, that\u2019s really we\u2019re going to continue to do cushion forward with the asset. Operator : Justin Long with Stephens, your line is open. Justin Long : Thanks and congrats on the quarter. Jim, you mentioned in the industrial environment and your view that things really haven't changed relative to your expectations last quarter. But could you comment on what's you're expecting on the retail side of the equation? And just curious to get any updated thoughts around peak season and may be what intermodal volumes could look like, once we lap all the rationalization and start to see more normalized numbers in 2020? Jim Foote : Yes sure, Justin. And again there are -- what it was -- one of the issues we've been struggling with throughout the year is the fact that everything whether it's the stock market, whether it's interest rates, whether it's already consumer-driven sides of the economy, we're all doing so well and we saw very early in the year that the industrial economy was separating and was not performing very well at all. And so last quarter when you know I said this was confusing, I think we had a pretty good sense of where things were going and it's proving out as we move through the second half. With that I'll let Mark \u2013 who is totally on top of Intermodal and what \u2013 whether or not we are going to have a peak will answer any other question. Mark Wallace : Justin, yes I mean our expectations for peak are somewhat muted this year. I think we'll see a little bit of a bump, but not the traditional solid peak and stock is still coming in so the -- sort of the consumer recall I mean is still doing relatively well. So, the apparel, the toys and the plastic Christmas trees and stuff are coming in \u2013 still coming in, but as we all know intermodal carries a lot more than just that kind of stuff to carry \u2013 lot of stuffs that goes into the industrial economy, machinery and auto parts and whole bunch of other stuff. So because of the economy the industrial economy being soft and IDP being so weak yes affected a lot of the intermodal volumes. Fourth quarter because of the economy and because of the consumer economy, we're hoping to have a relatively good post-Thanksgiving holiday peak so into the Christmas time frame hopefully people order a lot of stuff online, and we have the pleasure and the honor of moving along with that stuff. So I think that will help our intermodal volumes this quarter, but going into next year, we said we're not going to give you a lot of guidance there, but it really depends on what's driving the economy and where we are, but longer-term as we get through all these lane rationalizations and get through all this mess all in a good solid economy I would expect intermodal to do very well. Justin Long : Okay, great. And maybe as a quick follow-up for Kevin. Gains on sale there was a step-up relative to what we saw in first half on just quarterly run rate. Could you talk about what you're expecting from gains on sales perspective in the fourth quarter and then any early read on what we should be looking at in 2020? Kevin Boone : Yeah, I mean, the $65 million was a little bit above the normal run rate that you've seen historically. I would expect something well below that in the fourth quarter something more on the normalized range in the mid-20s, low 20s range for the fourth quarter. We'll wait \u2013 we'll hold off on 2020 to go through we still have great pipeline timing is always difficult to predict on when those transactions will hit, but I'd know Mark and his team continue to see a really good pipeline going forward. Justin Long : Okay, great. I\u2019ll leave it that. Thanks for the time. Operator : Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs, your line is open. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. Hi. Just a real quick question, I know it may be tough because of the team marketing of the Lanes and intermodal, but I'm just curious when you look at domestic versus the international intermodal, can you give a little color on both of those pieces of business relative order of magnitude weakness or thereabouts? Thanks. Jim Foote : Our international business has been stronger than the domestic business, so the domestic \u2013 as I talked about just a minute ago, the domestic business has been impacted by number of factors that the economy is certainly one of them, but I think clearly, a lot of capacity, we saw a very tight truck capacity last year, clearly a lot of new trucks came into the market lot of new drivers open-up a lot of additional capacity and so I think intermodal has been competing with that truck capacity this year prices obviously in truck spot prices have come down since \u2013 from last year, there are still above sort of the five year average, but clearly prices have come down. So I think the domestic business while good, it's just been soft, but our international business is still relatively okay. Jordan Alliger : Just a real quick follow-up. Just for perspective, do you have a sense for what proportion is just international versus domestic of the total carloads or revenue in the intermodal? Jim Foote : Yes. It's about 50/50. It's about 50/50. Jordan Alliger : Thanks very much. Operator : Next question is from Fadi Chamoun. Kevin Boone : I always say 40%, so actually it's a useful answer in the future. Who is Fadi? Jim Foote : Sorry, you\u2019re on -- maybe take your phone of mute. Operator : And you\u2019re ready for the next question, correct? Kevin Boone : Yes please. Next question. Operator : Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Fadi Chamoun : Okay, thank you. There is a lot of noise and feedback. Kevin Boone : Sorry Fadi. Fadi Chamoun : I apologize about that, but just a follow-up on this intermodal conversation, maybe one, I mean your service product is obviously getting a lot better and the network is highly efficient. And correct me if I'm wrong, in intermodal, you tend to have less capital intensity as far as how you run the business. Is there over the medium term given the truck opportunity a potential to reinvest kind of OR to accelerate growth or do you don't think that's a needed strategy to grow intermodal? Mark Wallace : Well Fadi, its Mark. This company has spent a lot of capital dollars over this year over the past decade or so to grow intermodal volumes and it was not very successful. And so, today we have spent the last year and half, two years reengineering the traditional hub-and-spoke intermodal franchise that was built over the past little while. So to answer your question, no, I don't believe and I don't think we believe that we need to spend any significant capital dollars to continue to grow our intermodal franchise. The team's focus right now is about taking touches out of the system. As you know, the more you have touch and handle on intermodal container, your cost go up and the profitability goes down. So we're focused on streamlining that business and getting it as efficient as possible and bringing on additional capacity. We've got ample capacity now to grow intermodal and when the volumes will return to Jim's point, the economy will turn around and when intermodal volumes do come back, we have ample capacity in then right now without spending any additional capital to move that product. Fadi Chamoun : Okay. And just also a follow-up on the previous question, so if contract rates, truck load contract rates stay flat or slightly down in the next 12 months, can you still grow domestic intermodal in the environment? Jim Foote : The majority of our intermodal business is locked up in long-term contracts, Fadi. So, we don't have any short-term opportunities to replace a lot of the business. So again a lot of the focus has been on the cost side and the efficiency side. But clearly as the economy comes back and we handle more intermodal business and are handling it in a more efficient way, yeah, I mean, we'll -- we can grow the business that way. Fadi Chamoun : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good evening everyone. Just a clarification. At the start of the call Jim I think you said something along the lines of 5% rationalization in lanes, can you just clarify that a little bit? Is this more intermodal lane rationalization in 2020? Is this what leftover from 2019 one or what exactly you are implying? Mark Wallace : Ravi, its Mark. Let me be clear and just so everybody has all the facts here. January of 2018, we began the rationalization about 7% of the franchise. Last October, October 1st of last year we took out an additional 3% -- rationalized additional 3% of the lanes and then in January of this year we did another 5%. And so we -- to Jim's earlier comment, we will be lapping in the fourth quarter, the 3% rationalization that we took in last year and then in January will be -- the lanes rationalization will be completely doing this. Ravi Shanker : Got it. So, no more rationalization in 2020? Mark Wallace : No. Ravi Shanker : Okay. And just as a follow-up, thanks for the color on the export coal pricing and the quarterly reset into next quarter. I think in the past you guys have said that you have take or pays in the export coal business to a certain extent until your contracts renew. Is that a gain on -- the same quarterly cadence you're talking about or is that more of annual thing and kind of did not have any impact in 3Q? Jim Foote : Both Ravi on the \u2013 both on the thermal side and on the met side. We have built in contract minimums. So as I mentioned I think in Q2 given the weakness in API2 and everything it was going on globally with thermal coal, we're experiencing the slowdown in volumes and we saw customer shipping it to their contract minimums that has not changed given the continued weakness in export coal benchmarks. I will say something that hasn't come up, we still expect our export coal volumes to hit sort of the 39 million to 40 million ton range for the year. Last year we did about 43 million tons, but even with everything that's going on, we still expect to be between 39 million and 40 million this year. Kevin Boone : And Ravi just to clarify we didn't have any liquidated damages in the third quarter. Jim Foote : Correct. Ravi Shanker : Understood. You articulated much better than I did in terms of the minimum volume shipped. So Mark just to kind of I know you guys are not talking about 2020, but if the benchmark would stay at current levels, you would expect that 40 to be lower next year once the minimum shipment levels reset? Jim Foote : If I could only predict what's going to happen to things that are completely out of my control \u2013 met benchmarks and API2\u2019s \u2013 I don't have a clue \u2013 I don\u2019t have a clue what's going to happen to the economy and I don't have a clue what's going to happen to export benchmarks So \u2013 hey, I get on my hands and knees every night and pray, but clearly yeah it's a headwind right now. Ravi Shanker : You and me both Mark. That's understandable. Thank you so much. Jim Foote : Great. Operator : Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial Group, your line is open. Bascome Majors : Hey. Kevin, now that you're firmly in the CFO seat, can you share your priorities for the finance organization be it balance sheet management capital deployment. And over the next two, three years what could change and then what definitely won't? Thank you. Kevin Boone : Thank you for the question. My priority is cash. I think when we look across the organization, I was talking to my team last week sometimes we prioritized OE over capital. And I think we have a lot of ability to look at our capital spend and focus there and make that a lot more efficient. There is opportunities, Jamie and I now sit right across from each other we're talking every day about and sharing information about where we see the opportunities whether it's overtime like we mentioned time and time again that was a new initiative and he is working closer and closer with all the people in finance, and just to uncover those opportunities there is opportunities everywhere, there is small buckets that it can add up to a lot of dollars overtime. But that's my priority is really looking at particularly just the return on capital if there is really high return projects out there that we can invest in we generated a lot of cash flow today. I wouldn't love nothing better than my organization to come with me with 20% -plus return projects that we can invest in our business to drive value overtime that's really where I'm focused on the next few months. Procurement also has been my area, and I know that group is doing a great job of finding additional cost savings from our suppliers working with them. But we're not afraid of investing in the business going forward. Bascome Majors : Thank you and congrats. Operator : David Vernon from Bernstein, your line is open. David Vernon : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the time. So Mark I wanted to ask you the export coal question a little bit differently. If you think about 2Q to 3Q, did we see any weakness in rates you guys were getting on the exports, you still retained or any sort of increase or decrease just to kind of how that has moved and just wondering kind of what percentage of that the tonnage you guys are moving right now has hedged that prices from earlier in the year? Mark Wallace : Well, again on the thermal side, these contracts our annual contracts so there weren't \u2013 for this year they were negotiated late last year or early into 2019, so those \u2013 they were set, they\u2019re tied to the benchmarks and that benchmark for API2 was a lot higher at the beginning of the year and late last year. On the met side as I said they get re-priced quarterly most of them some of them are monthly, but majority are quarterly. And as I said in Q2 the benchmark prices was over $200, Q3 almost fell that $160-ish and so we're going to feel that impact heading into Q4. David Vernon : Did we see that from 2Q to 3Q? Or is this going to be showing up in 4Q? Mark Wallace : No. We saw it in -- on thermal on the volumes in Q3 and we saw it in volumes as well. David Vernon : But not in the rate there, right? Mark Wallace : It\u2019s just of the process where because of the lag just beginning in the process and yes, we will see more of it as we go into the fourth quarter and next year. Kevin Boone : The range was set. For thermal, the rates were set and really it's been a volume play. David Vernon : Okay. And maybe just on the petroleum products business, can you give us a sense for what you're running right now in terms of splits between crude and NGLs and for the crude shipments kind of, is this mostly Bakken origination coming into the East Coast like what -- give us some idea about the flow is on the business? Jim Foote : Yes, I don't want to speak too specifically because others are listening, but we're moving crude today mostly from the Bakken. We've had obviously with the refinery explosion and we've seen some slowdown there which has impacted as per the remainder of the year. But it's probably as much as I want to go. We -- I should mention both on coal and on the accrued business and we brought in Adam, who is our new VP of Energy. He's taken a fresh look at all of these portfolios and task with figuring this all for us. Clearly, these are interesting commodities to manage, but Adam is very, very smart guy and he he's doing a great job looking at different things to help us longer term. So, look forward to updating everyone in the future on that. David Vernon : Any split on the crude versus NGL? Jim Foote : No, I don't want to give not right now. Operator : The last question today comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Walter Spracklin : Yeah, thanks so much. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Jim, you made reference to some technological innovations that you might or are currently looking towards implementing. I know there is at least one of the railroads investing significantly in those technologies. How much would you say and maybe there is a better question for Kevin. How much of your current CapEx envelope is dedicated to let's call it this pure technological innovation type of projects. And what's your strategy there? Is it more to see what others develop and then if it works we'll devote dollars to it or would you see yourselves adding more incremental dollars to your capital envelope to look for these technological innovation opportunities? Jim Foote : Walter, hi, thanks for asking the question. Right now, yes a bunch of questions. I'll try to answer them all. What we spent today is out of the total amount is a very small amount, but it has a meaningful impact on what we do. In many respects, historically speaking, the rail industry at CSX being no differently, we\u2019re currently holding to the supplier to come up with new ideas and new technology. I think now we work more collaboratively with the way to do things and we talk amongst ourselves in the rail industry about what works and what doesn't work and how we can do things more effectively and efficiently as leverage technology and technology is changing all the time, so clearly new opportunities for us. So it probably number one probably should, and therefore probably will that dollar amount that we spend on technology that help us run the railroad more efficiently will become bigger, but it's clearly, it's never going to get to the point where it's equal to what we spent on rail. So -- and we're all over everything whether it's automated artificial intelligence to help us do dispatching, using more and more technology in locomotives not just B2C whatever technology that's available out there to help us do things more effectively and efficiently, I mean just this little amount, we got three of these cars that are out there running along the railroad, doing constant inspection of our rail and the subsystem and everything else. We've seen a big improvement in our reducing our slow orders or incidents of rail breakage all of this because we captioned earlier then we would have when we weren't doing as much. So we're leveraging the heck out of that as much as we can and we're going to add more of it next year and next year and next year and next year, because it's hard to put a dollar value on what can happen if you have a big derailment associated with a rail break, if you knew you had a railcar up there that could have found it before that happened. So, we're all over it. We're going to continue to do that and I would say to be in that it will creep up over time. Walter Spracklin : Looking at way out, is there anything and maybe Jamie you might have seen some of it hasn't crossed Jim's desk yet or is there anything way on the horizon conceptual that if implemented really could hit the ball out of the park here in terms of those type of disruptive technologies? Jim Foote : Walter, I think a lot of the technology that we're on to the only thing that I would really mention on top of are train inspection portals. Not only are we looking at the track. We're also making sure that we X-ray vision and take camera footage of cars on by thorough inspection portals, but we've got a very strong IT development department within CSX, probably one of the most impressive I've seen in the industry. We are developing some art intelligence, crew intelligence. The crew intelligence is really something that I truly believe as we've been working on it for about a year now. Almost done that project, that's going to allow us to look 12 hours to 24 hours in advance to make sure that our crews are lined up where they need to be, and in position where they need to be. So as much as we balanced the railroad, you still got to worry about availability and that crew intelligence and some of the art intelligence that our team is working on here at CSX is going to really help us carry forward. Walter Spracklin : Appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. I will turn the call back over to the speakers. Bill Slater : Thank you everyone for joining. I believe that concludes our call for today. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call. And you may disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the CSX Corporation Fourth Quarter 2019 Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Slater, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. You may begin. Bill Slater : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Kevin Boone, Chief Financial Officer; and Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations. On slide two is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on slide three. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim Foote : Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon. I want to begin by thanking all of our CSX employees for another great job this quarter. They continue to show that they are the best operators in the industry. For both the fourth quarter and full year, they once again broke their own records and set new all-time low operating ratios. Our service is the best it has ever been and getting better. The key here is reliability. Our operating a simpler, more efficient network, we are able to offer rail users a service that is truck-like inconsistency, but with lower cost and more environmentally responsible. More shippers are selecting us for their shipping needs when we have tremendous opportunity for growth. Let's now turn to Slide 5 of the presentation. Our financial results are straightforward with only a few unique items, which Kevin will point out in a few minutes. Fourth quarter EPS declined 2% to $0.99. The operating ratio improved by 30 basis points to a new record of 60% as continued operating momentum offset top line headwinds. For the full year, EPS increased 9% to $4.17, and the operating ratio improved by 190 basis points to 58.4%. These are truly great results considering the industrial economy's second half performance. Turning to Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue declined 8% year-over-year, due to the continued impact of the softer industrial economy, intermodal lane rationalizations and coal headwinds. Merchandise revenue and volume declined 3% as growth in Ag and Food & Minerals markets was more than offset by declines in chemicals, auto and other markets. The Philadelphia refinery explosion and GM strike accounted for more than two-thirds of the volume declines in the quarter. Intermodal revenue declined 9% on 7% lower volume, primarily due to the impact of lane rationalizations implemented around the 2018 peak season. We have now lapped the impact of these changes. Coal revenue decreased 22% on 17% lower volumes with declines in both export and domestic markets, due to the impact of lower export demand and benchmark prices, as well as low natural gas prices. Lastly, other revenue declines resulted from lower storage revenue at intermodal facilities and lower demurrage charges. Moving to Slide 7. Let's review our safety performance. The full-year personal injury rate declined 15%, and we reduced the full-year train accident rate by 41%, including setting another company record in the fourth quarter for the lowest accident rate. This progress is a result of concerted daily effort on the part of the employees performing the work. At the same time, we still see areas where additional improvement is needed. In 2020, we will maintain our rigorous safety program focused on continuing education of our workforce, further strengthening rules compliance and empowering employees to have the courage to act if they see something unsafe. As I have said before, we will never be satisfied with our performance if just one of our employees gets injured while at work. Moving to Slide 8. Let's review our operating performance for the quarter. CSX set new all-time Company records for both velocity and dwell achieving significant year-over-year improvements, as well as strong sequential momentum. The combination of these improved metrics helped significantly increase car miles per day as we continue to translate incremental operating efficiencies into higher asset utilization across the network. We also continue to set fuel efficiency records operating below 1 gallon of fuel per 1,000 GTM despite typical seasonal headwinds in this quarter. CSX is the only US Class 1 railroad to have crossed this threshold. Fuel efficiency remains a key focus for the team, given the combination of financial as well as significant environmental benefits from reducing fuel consumption, and we believe opportunities remain to get even better going forward. Reducing emissions is important to us, our customers and the communities we serve. And we are proud to have been recognized by various institutions as leaders in sustainability for the transportation space. On Slide 9, most importantly, we are translating these operational improvements into more reliable service for our customers. Trip plan performance set new records again this quarter with 83% of our merchandise cars and 95% of intermodal containers hitting their hourly trip plan targets. Additionally, we successfully completed the roll-out of individualized trip plan performance data to our merchandise and intermodal customers. Feedback on the tool has been very positive, and we believe providing this unique level of transparency to our customers will continue to differentiate CSX's best-in-class service. I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will review the financial results. Kevin Boone : Thank you Jim and good afternoon everyone. Turning to Slide 11 I'll walk you through the highlights of the summary income statement. As Jim mentioned total revenue was down 8% in the fourth quarter as the impact of lower intermodal and coal volume as well as reduced fuel recovery, lower other revenue and unfavorable mix more than offset the benefit of pricing gains and merchandise and intermodal. Moving to expenses. Total operating expenses were 9% lower in the fourth quarter. A significant achievement that reflects CSX's ability to react to changing markets while delivering record service levels. Overall, these results reflect the company's sustained operating improvements and significant gains and labor and asset efficiency. Labor and trends expense was 3% lower with average headcount down 7% or nearly 1,600. Efficiency gains were strong in the quarter partially offset by inflation, other costs and still in competition including accelerations of stock compensation related to certain retirement eligible employees. Our ongoing refinement of the operating plan continues the drive savings from pure accrue starts enabling a 9% year-over-year reduction in the active train and engine employee base and driving is 7% improvement in crew utilization as measured by gross ton miles per active train and engine employee. The workforce efficiency and management execution reduce over time across the operating department by nearly 15% sequentially or approximately 30% versus the fourth quarter 2018. Additionally, the average active locomotive count was down 10% year-over-year in the quarter. The smaller fleet combined with fewer cars online and freight car repair efficiencies that will drive a 9% reduction in the mechanical workforce while also reducing mechanical overtime expense by over 40%. Finally, we cycle a unique benefit in the prior year related to the railroad retirement tax refund. MS&O expense improved 20% versus the prior year. Continued improvements to the train plan combined with increased network fluidity have enabled an 8% reduction in crew travel and repositioning expenses. On the mechanical side the lower locomotive counts also drove savings and MS&O including a 26% reduction in locomotive materials and contracted service expense versus the fourth quarter of 2018. Real estate and line sales were 10 million lower in the quarter. We continue to see a pipeline of real estate opportunities and for planning purposes we currently expect gains in 2020 to be approximately $60 million while the impact of these transactions will remain uneven from quarter to quarter as you remember in March of 2018 at our investor conference we guided for $300 million in real estate sales proceeds over three years. We will significantly exceed this guidance with our expected 2020 results. Fuel expense was $37 million favorable or 15% year-over-year in the quarter. These savings were driven by a 7% decrease in the per gallon price but were further aided by lower volume and significant efficiency improvements. Our enhanced focus on utilization of distributed power and energy management software combined with training train handling rules compliance drove a fourth-quarter record fuel efficiency. Full-year 2019 fuel efficiency was also an all-time best for CSX. Looking at the other expense items. Depreciation was relatively flat year-over-year. While we did recognize $10 million an additional expense this quarter due to a 2019 depreciation study this was more than offset by other items none of which were individually significant. We expect depreciation expense to increase approximately $50 million to $60 million in 2020 reflecting the continued impact of the recent study as well as a higher net asset base. Equipment rents expense increased 9% as the impact of inflation and other items more than offset the benefit of lower volume related costs and efficiency gains. Equity earnings increased $7 million in the quarter into higher net earnings at our affiliates. Looking below the line. Interest expense increased primarily due to higher debt balances partially offset by a lower all-in coupon. Other income decreased $4 million as the company recognized a $10 million make hold premium on the early redemption of 500 million of long-term notes in October. This was partially offset by increased income from higher investment balances. Income tax expense decreased $45 million due to lower pre-tax earnings and further aided by certain state tax matters and federal legislative benefits. Absent unique items, we would expect an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5% for future quarters. Closing out the P&L as Jim highlighted in his opening remarks CSX operating income declined 8% year-over-year in the fourth quarter reflecting the challenging volume environment. Despite the tough backdrop the company delivered another record operating ratio of 60%, a 30 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter 2018. Finally, turning to Slide 12, turning to the cash side of the equation on Slide 12, in 2019 capital investment declined $88 million or 5% year-over-year while overall capital investment declined investments in our core track, bridge and signal infrastructure saw an increase of 13% as we continued to prioritize investments that provide safe and reliable train operations. Overall, our reduced asset intensity especially in rolling stock has enabled us to sustain lower levels of capital investment without compromising safety or reliability. The level of PTC spending has also come down significantly in the last two years. Free cash flow has continued to be a key focus for this team generating operating productivity while driving improved capital efficiency has produced differentiated free cash flow conversion. Growth in CFX's core operating cash flow generation including improvements in working capital drove a 9% increase in adjusted free cash flow to $3.5 billion in 2019. We\u2019ve returned over $4.1 billion to shareholders in 2019 including nearly $3.4 billion in buybacks and over $750 million in dividends. Additionally, we are exiting 2019 with nearly $2 billion of cash in short-term investments which combined with another year of substantial free cash flow generation provides significant opportunities to reinvest in the business and continue to return cash to shareholders. With that let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Foote : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 11, I'll walk you through the highlights of the summary income statement. As Jim mentioned, total revenue was down 8% in the fourth quarter as the impact of lower intermodal and coal volume, as well as reduced fuel recovery, lower other revenue and unfavorable mix more than offset the benefit of pricing gains and merchandise and intermodal. Moving to expenses. Total operating expenses were 9% lower in the fourth quarter, a significant achievement that reflects CSX's ability to react to changing markets, while delivering record service levels. Overall, these results reflect the Company's sustained operating improvements and significant gains in labor and asset efficiency. Labor and fringe expense was 3% lower, with average headcount down 7% or nearly 1,600. Efficiency gains were strong in the quarter, partially offset by inflation, other cost and incentive compensation, including acceleration of stock compensation related to certain retirement eligible employees. Our ongoing refinement of the operating plan continue to drive savings from fewer crew starts, enabling a 9% year-over-year reduction in the active train and engine employee base, and driving a 7% improvement in crew utilization, as measured by gross ton miles per active train and engine employee. The workforce efficiency and management execution rereduce over time across the operating department by nearly 15% sequentially, or approximately 30% versus the fourth quarter 2018.

Real estate and line sales were $10 million lower in the quarter. We continue to see a pipeline of real estate opportunities. And for planning purposes, we currently expect gains in 2020 to be approximately $60 million, while the impact of these transactions will remain uneven from quarter-to-quarter. As you remember, in March of 2018, at our Investor Conference, we guided for $300 million in real estate sale proceeds over three years.

Turning to the cash side of the equation on Slide 12. In 2019, capital investment declined $88 million or 5% year-over-year. While overall capital investment declined, investments in our core track, bridge and signal infrastructure saw an increase of 13% as we continue to prioritize investments that provide safe and reliable train operations. Overall, our reduced asset intensity, especially enrolling stock, has enabled us to sustain lower levels of capital investment without compromising safety or reliability. The level of PTC spending has also come down significantly in the last two years. Free cash flow has continued to be a key focus for this team. Generating operating productivity while driving improved capital efficiency has produced differentiated free cash flow conversion.

Additionally, we are exiting 2019 with nearly $2 billion of cash and short-term investments, which combined with another year of substantial free cash flow generation, provide significant opportunities to reinvest in the business and continue to return cash to shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Foote : Great, thank you, Kevin. Let's turn to Slide 14 in our outlook for 2020. We expect underlying economic demand to remain relatively consistent with current levels. It took industrial activity awhile to cool off, and it will take a while to heat back up. Based on this, we expect full-year revenue to be flat to down 2% versus 2019. This forecast includes more than $300 million of top line headwinds from the coal business, driven primarily by lower export coal volumes and pricing. For the first half of the year, the merchandise business will continue to lap the higher economic level -- the higher level of economic activity from the first half of 2019, but we expect merchandise volume growth to turn positive in the second half of the year. We expect intermodal volumes to increase in 2020 as we have now fully lapped the lane rationalization impact and look to grow the reengineered network. As to the operating ratio, our goal is to operate as efficiently as possible while ensuring we maintain our reliable service product. Our focus is on growing the business and in that context, we are targeting cost efficiencies that will not inhibit service. There are additional cost levers out there for us to pull, but we must make sure we are well positioned to capture new business and respond to demand when industrial production moves up. Looking at the 2019 operating ratio results, we again outperformed our real estate target of approximately $100 million a year. Adjusting for this outperformance implies a baseline operating ratio of 59%. Despite roughly $300 million of operating income headwinds in 2020 related to export coal and non-core items such as lower real estate gains, higher depreciation and lower other revenue, we still expect to realize enough incremental savings across the business to maintain or hopefully, even improve our margins. For capital allocation, our first call on cash is maintaining the integrity and reliability of our railroad. As Kevin noted in 2019, we again significantly increased investments in rail infrastructure, spending more on rail, ties, ballasts and signals, and we expect to maintain this level of investment going forward. In total, we project capital expenditures for the year of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, in line with our 2019 targets. In the absence of any high return growth projects, we expect the next principal use of cash flow will be continued return of capital to shareholders through both dividends and additional share buybacks. Importantly, we are committing to doing so in a way that maintains our strong investment-grade credit rating. Over the last two years, we have accomplished many exciting things at CSX and fundamentally transformed the way the Company does business. However, none of us are resting on that success. In fact, we have only scratched the surface of this Company's potential. I believe the best is yet to come for CSX as we continue our journey to be coming the best railroad in North America. Bill? Bill Slater : Thank you Jim. In the interest of time I would like to ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question and one follow-up only if necessary. With that we will now take questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes Brandon Oglenski from Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Brandon Oglenski : Hey good afternoon everyone and congrats on a pretty good year relative to pretty difficult conditions. Jim or I don't know if Mark Wallace is on the line but do you guys mind digging a little bit deeper into your macro assumptions behind the flat to down 2% revenue assumption? And I think you did call out some headwinds in coal as well. Do you mind just repeating that again? Mark Wallace : Yes sure Brandon. It's Mark. So going into 2020 we expect a continuation of the current macroeconomic trends to continue. We know the consumer economy remains strong but PMI and IDP and other macro indicators suggest that we're not going to see a near-term increase in industrial activity. IDP is projected to be relatively flat for the year and the PMI read in December was 47.2 which was the second worst since \u201809 and the 5th consecutive month signaling contraction. So given this we're not forecasting a hockey stick recovery but any improvement in the macro environment would be upside for us. Despite these challenges we're going to continue to get better on what we can control providing high-quality service to our customers and executing. We have not changed our outlook for long term revenue growth intermodal as we've said many times we I think we think we can grow 2-ish times GDP and merchandise GDP plus. So we're going to stay close to our customers, watch things and see if sentiment improves throughout the year but clearly as I said we're not forecasting any type of a big recovery in the year. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. I guess it's a related follow-up Mark can you just tell us how the marketing strategy and sales strategy has changed with CSX especially related to intermodal and merchandise? Mark Wallace : Yes. Sure. I mean in 2009 we spent a lot at a time revamping the entire sales and marketing organization. We've changed a lot of people, brought in some great talent. We've actually developed a strong marketing team, no longer a pricing team as we've discussed in the past. The marketing team is doing a fantastic job working hard doing actual marketing activities and looking for opportunities to gain share from truck and going after them and providing the sales team with those leads and those opportunities to grow our share as we are leveraging this fantastic service product that Jim and his operating colleagues have provided the sales team to sell. On the intermodal side again as Jim alluded to we are through our lane rationalizations that began in late of 2017. We have a great intermodal network that we're leveraging and we're excited to sell our as Jim said our 95% plus trip plan compliance or trip plan performance numbers and even higher in some other in some lanes is exciting and customers are taking note and we are executing and doing really well with our intermodal customers there. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Your line is open. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Good afternoon. I wanted to see, I appreciate the detail on coal the perspective. I think that $300 million is a revenue number, any thoughts on how we might think of that in terms of an EBITD number? Is that presumably a fairly high incremental margin? Is that a 50% incremental margin or how would you think about the EBITD headwind related to the coal revenue comment that you provided? Kevin Boone : Hey Tom, it's Kevin. We've really never broken down the profitability between our different segments but we've always said that the coal business is obviously a very attractive business for us and we're going to continue to move as much coal as we can but that's probably as far as we want to go there on the profitability side. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. What about I guess start in terms of the pricing assumption you have for seaborne? I mean it seems like you see Queensland benchmark look like I think it went down to or the market went down to the 130 area you've kind of I think come back to 150. Is there any sense within that coal headwind kind of what you're assuming broad brush for the seaborne prices format? Mark Wallace : Yes. Tom this is Mark again. The net benchmarks and again the met is about 65% of our export coal. The benchmark prices have continued to decline as the global production has weakened and currently there are about 150 bucks. As a reminder our contracts reprice quarterly so you should expect to see a bit of a drag on the RPU into Q1 but that's kind of where it is and we will see what happens throughout the year. As a reminder this time last year the met prices were coming into the first quarter of the year or about 220 bucks. Tom Wadewitz : So you just assume they kind of stay where they are today. Is that the right way to think about it? Mark Wallace : Correct. Yes. So we will see the overall for coal we are going to see a step down in the first quarter but sequentially throughout the rest of the year we don't think it's going to get any worse on the RPU. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it. Mark Wallace : Sure. Operator : Ken Hoexter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Ken Hoexter : Great. Hey good afternoon and just maybe Jim looking at the expense side you've kind of accelerated costs here but if volumes are going to be down maybe you can talk about if most of the PSR gains are over, how do you think about moving along with reducing expenses in light of these reduced volumes in contrast to your statement about being cautious about not going too far to be prepared for the rebound and specifically like in the employees. Jim Foote : Yes, I will ask Jim to give a little color on it here but there are significant amount of cost reduction embedded in that guidance that we provided just to offset inflation and other cost increases that we set out in terms of the increases in depreciation, etc. So but this game is not over and we're going to do the first and foremost thing is to make sure that we're a well-positioned to provide a really good quality product to our customers in the future and again Jamie offer a little more color on the specific initiatives. Jamie Boychuk : Absolutely. We are continuing to look for good improvements this year on fuel definitely towards our car higher end of things. We're finding as we become more fluid out there and the railroad moves better, our bigger yards are able to do more for us. So we're looking at getting rid of more out of route miles. Our locomotive fleet continues to go in a great direction as we utilize to get more miles out of our engines which again turns into fewer asset costs with respect to repairs and parts and really it just keeps on chipping away each and every day we're getting involved and getting into what's going on out on the balanced line and that's probably the most important piece that the team is doing is as we're getting on the balanced line and we're walking out there and looking at each industry looking at how we switch them, how can we do things better and by getting out of headquarters and making sure that all the right team including myself is out there each and every week taking a look at what we can do different and better not only does it give us an opportunity to continue to reduce costs but continue to improve the product that we're able to supply Mark and his team to get out there and gain some more business as we keep on moving along. Ken Hoexter : Thanks but I guess maybe I was trying to be more specific on the employee side. So employees were down over 1,500 year-on-year. Is that something you see accelerating at this point given the volume declines or is that holding, I don't understand given Jim's commentary over not taking out too much to be prepared for the rebound. Jim Foote : Well, you know as we've said before our focus is on labor cost not just headcount reduction. We've made a significant reduction in the labor costs and not just targeting heads. So we'll continue to look for ways to reduce our labor costs and as we did in this quarter and as we'll do in every quarter that we have to manage the company. We'll do what's necessary around here based upon what we see in terms of business activities. Right now we've kind of given you guidance that we think especially on the merchandise side of the business there's going to be some reasonable stability sequentially in terms of where the volume line should be and an increase on the intermodal side and we'll manage the headcount according to that if it goes sideways or downward you guys get the numbers every week and if you miss a week or something we will point it out to you that which direction the numbers are going in. Ken Hoexter : Great and just a quick follow-up Jim, the arrivals really jumped or maybe Jamie from 53% on time two quarters ago to 85% now? Is there something beyond just execution that you're kind of that you want to highlight I guess on the positive side something really a strong performance there? Jamie Boychuk : I mean look at the team is executing. The guys are out on the ground taking a look at everything we can. We'll probably ,I can tell you right now we're going to crank the times a little bit. We're going to pull sometimes out of our trains. We're going to get things moving faster on the network with respect to cutting out some hours on how long it takes to get across the network and that number might bump down a little bit into the next quarter because we tighten things up. So that's a gauge for us to make sure that our assets and people get to the other end so we can turn them back but at the same time when I see that number start to go up it tells myself and the team that on the service design side we can take a look at removing some hours and times from our trains getting across the network. Ken Hoexter : Appreciate the thoughts. Thanks guys. Operator : Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good afternoon. So obviously this year you have a number of headwinds that you outlined and that was really helpful but I just want to understand and also you've talked about more to do on the cost side but just broadly speaking do you need a more normal volume environment in order to really leverage those costs and get the OR even lower somewhere in the mid to high 50s. How should we think about that in terms of the different revenue environments? Kevin Boone : Hey Allison it's Kevin. Clearly, we've outlined more cost savings that we think and there's runway to continue to do that. The model we're setting up here is where we're positioning ourselves for growth and really to leverage that when the growth comes and so I think we're very excited about the model we've created. There's a lot of leverage in this model really drop the revenue at a higher incremental margin. That's what we're looking forward as Mark and the team are diligently pursuing growth opportunities for us. So but as Jim just explained too if the volume environment gets worse than what we expect we all know we have to react. We did it last year. We came in to 2019 thinking revenue was going to be $500 million higher. We had to react after in the second quarter and Jamie and the team pulled together we came up with a new plan based on the volume that we saw from that point on and we adjust it and I think we did a great job. So we'll do it again if we have to. Jim Foote : The math will just work out in terms of what the margins are should be the business levels come back. We're building a tremendous company here with great operating leverage to take advantage of incremental volumes when they come back. Allison Landry : Okay, that's definitely helpful. And maybe just on that point but specifically to your expectations for intermodal volume growth this year. If truck rates remain weak for first time period of time through 2020 is there a point at which you might be willing to give a little bit on price to maybe drive some of that traffic into the network or would you just wait for capacity to shore up and then wait for the volumes? Jamie Boychuk : No, listen Allison we're not going to be cutting prices to grow the business. I think the team here is CSX's worked away too hard to do everything we've done to provide our customers with exceptional service out there. Large portion of the vast majority of our intermodal network on the domestic side is under long-term contracts anyway. We're not looking to grow by just to going out and slashing rates. That's not our game plan. That's not what we're going to do but the truck environment is still pretty loose to build as we saw it last quarter. We don't think there's going to be any meaningful snapback or tightening there but clearly if that happens it'll be a demand driven environment to prevent and that would be good for intermodal that happened. Allison Landry : Thank you. Operator : Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks operator. Hi everybody. Kevin just wanted to quickly confirm the $300 million for coal that was a revenue number right? Kevin Boone : Absolutely. Yes. That was revenue number. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. That makes sense and it's obviously implied 15% decline. Any help on how we can maybe you can provide some color on what's split between the volume in revenue per yield on that? What's the makeup of that and then I thought you had said last quarter the DNA expenses we're going to pick up sequentially by about $15 million. We obviously didn't see that. Just wondering if there's any impact the first quarter and what should we think about from a sequential from a DNA perspective? Kevin Boone : Yes. I'll have the DNA question. I might pass off the coal question to Mark. Jim Foote : You want to do DNA first. Kevin Boone : Yes. On the depreciation like we did expect from the life study to have a little bit of uptick here in the fourth quarter which was offset by some smaller items so we basically netted out the zero. I did guide for 2020 and the 50 million to 60 million range incremental depreciation year-over-year. So we'll see some bump up from the life study and some incremental capital spend next year. That's the expectations. So no change at 2020 expectation there. Mark Wallace : Amit on the coal side let me run through the coal environment and hopefully we can get to the your answer without me answering just specifically but starting with export as we've talked about before it's been a tale of two cities between met and thermal. As we guided through the year up to 2019 our expectations for export coal was it was around 40 million tons. We slightly missed that number coming in around 38 million. I tried to round it up to 39 and Kevin will allow me to so it had to be 38 but we now expect this year to deliver low 30s for 2020. As I said we expect the declines both for met and thermal but probably larger for thermal than on the met side. On the thermal side again it's one third of our export shipments where we've seen largest volume declines given low natural gas prices and mild winters in Europe obviously impacting the coal demand there and the API to benchmark as we talked about a little bit earlier is 55 bucks per ton. So really low. On the met side again it mostly a price story not a volume story but a price story. I went back to my comment earlier the prices have continued to slide down to about a $150 per ton today. So that's kind of what we see on the export coal front. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. That's very helpful and then just one follow-up for me. Kevin we saw, I guess a pretty sizable uptake in the labor for inch per employee I know there was you call that some acceleration incentives stock comp. So I just wondering what's the right way to think about that line item in 2020 because you have regular inflation but you guys have also been kind of focusing on managing overtime and with the volume environment being what it is there could be some cross currents there. So if you can just talk about that and if I missed it just help us think about how headcount will be at the end of 2020 as well. Thanks. Kevin Boone : Yes. You talked about the incentive comp as a little bit headwind to that number when you calculated. The other thing that you have to remember in the fourth quarter is we have a lot of our capital teams particularly on the engineering side that go over into vacation and once a lot of their labor through the year is going towards capital but once they go on vacation it starts to hit ROE expense. So there is a bit of seasonality to our per employee cost and so that's what you saw there in the fourth quarter. Amit Mehrotra : But it was a year-over-year number. It was up over 4% year-over-year? Kevin Boone : Yes. I think some of that impact as well and then obviously the inflation that had set within that number. There's a little bit of mix as well but going on in the next year I wouldn't see any significant rise in our current employee cost. What was the other part of the question? Amit Mehrotra : Just the year-end headcount in 2020? Kevin Boone : Yes. I think look we have a lot of momentum obviously that we've carried through the 2019 that will go into 2020. We'll continue to focus on managing attrition. There's a process here where we look at every job that comes available and ask ourselves given the model whether that job is necessary. So we'll continue to evaluate those. With the lower volume there's opportunities on the operating side that we'll find. So we'll continue to manage the labor side. It's not all about headcount. It's about the overtime which we saw some great success in fourth quarter. We have big targets next year to continue to drive the overtime down as well. So it's across the board on the labor savings. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. All right. Thank you for the time gentlemen. Appreciate it. Operator : Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey thanks for taking my question. Mark, I want to ask you about the pricing environment especially given the softness here to start the year in rare volumes and the industrial economies mentioned. In last quarter you gave some indication of same store sales and how they were trending. So just given that the backdrop and what we're seeing on the rail industry is from a pricing perspective wanted to see what you thought was kind of the current market temperature when it came to price realizing you just commented on not gaining volume for price. So just what you see the market would be helpful. Mark Wallace : Yes. I was going to repeat that but we're not so but within merchandise and intermodal our same store sales pricing in Q4 was about in line with what we saw in Q3 which again was the strongest I think I said back then was the strongest we had seen in the past three years and our contract renewals the pricing on our contract renewals that came up in the quarter exceeded our same store sales pricing. So clearly the team is doing a great job to value the product for the service that we're offering to customers and we're pleased and I am pleased with the great work that the team is doing on the pricing side. Brian Ossenbeck : And in terms of the inflation indices do you have a lot of exposure in the contracts they're just naturally reset lower in this coming year or is that not? Mark Wallace : No, I mean on the thermal side those are annual contracts so they will reset sort of now on the met as I talked about earlier they retrace every quarter but clearly so that the met benchmarks being 140-ish or 150-ish h and $150 a ton in Q4 will sort of reset those contracts in Q1. So yes. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Thanks Mark. Operator : Scott Group, Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Group : Hey. Thanks. Afternoon. So I think you talked earlier about $300 million of operating profit headwinds. So I presume that's coal plus any of the discrete cost stuff. I just want to review that discrete cost thing. So I got real estate and depreciation but maybe Kevin can you just walk us through any of the other discrete costs headwinds that you see in 2020? Kevin Boone : Yes, I think we obviously we called out the real estate sales this year and 2019 we\u2019ve realized roughly $160 million the guidance for that is $60 million which I talked about in my opening comments. The depreciation step up of $50 million to $60 million versus what we saw in 2019 are the items outside of coal that we've really kind of called out. Scott Group : Anything on the other railway revenue or the other income that you want us to be thinking about? Kevin Boone : Yes. I think where we run rating today is probably a consistent a good way to think about it going in the next year. So there will be a little bit headwind on the other revenue side as our customers, the merge cost stuff lowered gone down over the year. So we will have a little bit higher other revenue in the first half of the year and kind of normalized to where we are right now. Scott Group : Okay. And then just lastly when we get back to revenue growth? What are the right incremental margin? Sounds like you're positioning yourself you said for incremental margins. Is that 50%, 60%, 40% how should we think about incremental margins when we get back to revenue growth? Kevin Boone : Probably the best incremental margins that other businesses would be envy itself. Mark Wallace : At some level you know it doesn't matter where the business comes but we have a lot of trains that have capacity. So obviously in those situations on the merchandise manifest business when we're adding up a car to the back of a train, existing train there's not a lot of cost you add to it, little bit of car hire a little bit of fuel but I think the incremental margins will be quite attractive. Scott Group : Thank you guys. Operator : Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Your line is open. Chris Wetherbee : Hey thanks. Good afternoon. I want to ask about the revenue line. So if you take out the $300 million from coal that headwind sort of seems like you're guiding revenues kind of up a little bit to maybe up 2.5% or so and we know we have some headwinds from other revenue with some of the ancillary stuff from earlier in the year last year. How should we be thinking about maybe that cadence? Is it merchandise volume that improves as we go through the year in addition to intermodal volume? Maybe if you can help sort of bridge some of that gap because I would have thought mix might have been a bit negative too. So that any color would be helpful there. Kevin Boone : Sure Chris. So we talked to we talked about coal being a significant headwind down sort of mid to double digits as Jim alluded to. In intermodal revenue we expect in 2020 we're going to return to a GDP plus environment as we lap our lane rationalizations and as I said many times our service product is strong with 95% plus [indiscernible] compliance. So I think a very good momentum there. On merchandise we exited 2019 a really well positioned to grow with a strong service product and I think even despite the tough environment and the tough comps year-over-year we can see a slight improvement revenue growth in the first half and with a stronger [technical difficulty] second half. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. So maybe inherently ex coal volume up for the full year does that sound right? Kevin Boone : I would say that yes absolutely. Jim Foote : Again in the merchandise business segment if it hadn't been for the two specific items which I pointed out the refinery explosion and the GM strike we would have been close to flat this year in terms of volumes in merchandise which is significantly different than the rest of the industry and so we're reasonably positive as the business environment begins to at what point in time I don't know when that's going to happen. This is not the new norm. This is kind of a natural evolution. Things go down and then they go back up. When these things start to go back up we would expect to see merchandise volumes begin to increase and intermodal we have always said we believe we have a fantastic intermodal franchise. We have fantastic intermodal service and we had to bite the bullet over a two-year period to re-engineer the franchise to make it better as we go into 2020. We knew that's what we were doing and now we're going to see as Mark said hopefully a growth two times GDP. So put those together and 80% of our business should be doing extremely well. Unfortunately, all four discrete segments of the coal business are getting hit simultaneously which is difficult for us to overcome. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That's very hopeful color. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next Bascome Majors from Susquehanna International. Your line is open. Bascome Majors : Yes. Good evening guys. I wanted to go back to the service levels. You improved your trip plan performance in the car load business by 7 full points in this quarter. It had been pretty steady in the mid 70s before this gap hire. Can you dig a little more into how you're able to drive such a big improvement in 4Q if there's anything that's sustainable or something lumpy there and as you look forward is the conversation with your customers changing? Are you feeling that this yields excess car load business growth over some period of time? Can you just tell us how that's going on the ground? Thank you. Jim Foote : I will start off with the product that we were able to create here and then let Mark touch on some of the feedback he's getting from the customers but look we've got a fantastic team of railroaders out there with CSX and we've gone through this transition over the past two and a half years almost three years and trip plans was a difficult piece for us to work on as a group. And we tackled the first piece of intermodal which Mark had just mentioned the team has been knocking it out of the park over 95%. We still haven't achieved internally what we want to achieve for a trip plan on the merchandise side but it is day in and day out grinding, discussions, talking with the field working inside and out with each and every one of our operators in order to move up each percentage point. So we have I would like to say the most stringent trip plan with respect to a two-hour buffer and that's it. We measure empties which I don't believe any other railroad does and we work really hard hand-in-hand seven days a week driving that product. So I would say that we're going to continue to see that percentage improve as we continue to prepare and get Mark's team ready to jump out there and make those sales. Mark Wallace : And intermodal we measure to the minute. Jamie Boychuk : Yes intermodal absolutely. Mark Wallace : Within two hours. So if we missed by a minute, it's a trip plan failure. October 1, we rolled out trip plans. As Jim said in his opening remarks to our customers, on ship CSX in December, I think, on the 2, we rolled our trip plan performance out to all our merchandise customers, so they have total unprecedented visibility to every car whether it's a load, whether it's an empty on the CSX network. These are unprecedented visibility to their trip plans to what we're doing, how we're how we're doing in every lane, every car and customers love the tool, something they've never know railroad has ever provided this type of visibility. Listen, it's been having an impact. I think going back to Jim's comments a few minutes ago if you look at our carload performance in Q4, we were down 3%; the industry was down 5%. If you take out the PES, the impact of PES refineries and the GM strike, we were flat in merchandise; rest of the industry down 5%. Clearly, customers are responding to that type of level of performance and rewarding us with their more of their business and we're winning share every day from trucks. And we're going to continue to push. And as this performance plus 83% for the quarter was great. We're hitting high 80s today and low 90s with some customers. And we're going to continue to -- I know, Jamie is not satisfied and team is not satisfied with that. So as we get better, continue to push and become more truck-like and provide great service. And we're going to be rewarded with more business. Jamie Boychuk : The one piece to remember on trip plans for us, what Mark and his team has taken beyond what I think anyone ever thought trip plans were going to be. Trip plans are more of an internal metrics, so we can see how we were doing and look at costs as well as getting hour-by-hour across the network by putting this out to the customers, put the pressure definitely on the operating team, but guess what, we are hitting it. And look, we got a little bit more work to go, but we've taken this beyond what I think anyone ever thought trip plans could be. Jamie Boychuk : The one piece to remember on trip plans for us what Mark has and his team has taken beyond what I think anyone ever thought trip plans are going to be trip plans are more of an internal metric. So we can see how we were doing and look at costs as well as getting hour by hour across a network by putting this out to the customers put the pressure definitely on the operating team but guess what we're hitting it and look we've got a little bit more work to go but we've taken this beyond what I think anyone ever thought trip plans could be. Jim Foote : And going from whatever the number was over the last couple of quarters, say, 75% to 85% in terms of the carload trip plan compliance. Two years ago that number was 35%. The reason we have to give our visibility and tracking mechanisms to our customers is so that they will trust us to try our new service product to prove to them that it is as reliable today as a truck. When a couple of years ago, your trip plan compliance was 35% and you were trying to get a customer to switch from moving his freight in a truck to rail, he didn't have a lot of confidence that the -- his freight was going to get to his customer on time when you're on-time performance was 35%. So that's why it's so important that we focus on this metric. And then, we're so confident that this number would be reliable and consistent, but even more importantly, that customer believes that, that product is reliable and consistent. So he is willing to shift. He's always been willing to pay the 15% premium to buy the reliability in a truck. We need to show him through this transparent tool that he can trust us to get his product there when we said we're going to get it there. Bascome Majors : Great. I appreciated the comprehensive answer from everyone. Thank you. Operator : Justin Long from Stephens. Your line is open. Justin Long : Thanks, and good afternoon. So I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color around what the guidance assumes for that quarterly cadence of consolidated volumes. Is it the right way to think about it that we should see something like a low- to-mid single-digit decline in the first half and then something like a low-single-digit growth number in the back half as the comps ease? Mark Wallace : Yes. Clearly, we're lapping some -- going up against some tough comps here in the first quarter as I -- in the second quarter of the first half as I said. We had a pretty good environment in the first half of 2019. But we got a great service product. And we're going to do as much as we can. As I said, I think we're going to be able to do well in intermodal in the first half and in merchandise, hopefully, eke out some positive volume growth in merchandise. But we will, as we sort of get into the back half of the year, we think that it will be a little bit stronger than the first half for sure. Jamie Boychuk : Yes. I think, Justin, you'll see throughout the year going first quarter will mark the low point from a growth perspective. That's probably across all of the -- not only revenue, but operating income, EPS across the board. And then from there -- and this is a lot of just based on the comps as we get in the back half of the year lapping some of the coal and some of the other headwinds that we saw in 2019, that growth should improve. Justin Long : Okay. But when you put together all the pieces, do you think in the second half of this year, volumes can be up on a year-over-year basis, is that the assumption? Jim Foote : Yes. Justin Long : Okay. Great. And then, secondly on free cash flow, obviously, that's a highlight of the business right now. So I wanted to ask in 2020 and beyond, what's the right framework in your mind to be thinking about for the free cash flow conversion percentage? And then, also on buybacks, Kevin, maybe you could provide a little color on the magnitude you're expecting in 2020 relative to what we saw last year? Kevin Boone : Yes. Free cash flow conversion, our goal is to remain -- keep that high. We have some headwinds in terms of cash tax rate that will -- over time, that's going to trend higher. We're going to do everything we can on -- to offset that with working capital initiatives and really taking a look at our capital program and how efficient we can be on that side to save dollars there. So, a lot of opportunities. I don't think we have any plans to go back to the old ways of very low free cash flow conversion that we saw historically from not only CSX, but the industry. So we -- that's something we pride ourselves in. We continue to strive to maintain and have every plan to. On the buyback, we are taking in $2 billion of cash, as I mentioned, end of the year. It gives us a tremendous amount of flexibility. There is no reason for us to retain $2 billion of cash on our balance sheet. So that allows us some flexibility going next year to be opportunistic when the markets present opportunities and we'll do that. We'll also look at the dividend as well. So we have a history of returning cash to shareholders, and we'll continue to do that. Justin Long : Okay. Great. Thanks for the time. Operator : David Vernon from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. David Vernon : Hey, Mark, I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the expectation that intermodal is going to get better, it sounds like you were thinking in the front half we might start to see a return to growth. How are your intermodal partners kind of talking to you about the outlook for the business in terms of their ability to actually attract share? We're coming off a year where domestic intermodal is down, call it, whatever 5%, 6%. What's going to flip that switch that's going to get that volume to start coming back on to the network? Mark Wallace : Yes. Let me split it up a little bit and talk both intermodal on the international side, on the domestic side. But the international business, it was down less than domestic. We're still continuing to see -- going into the early part of 2020 and hopefully, for the rest of the year, we're continuing to see good growth there on the international side with inland port strategy and some new service offerings with our customers. But the overall market remains soft. But we are doing well with picking up some business there. I think -- listen again, customers are not responding to our repositioned network. It's moving faster and more reliably and more efficiently. And they like to service, and we're doing well to grow the intermodal franchise. And we're lapping those lane rationalizations, those are all behind us now and we're growing from that. So, again, we think -- given the environment and given the service product we got and we can grow this thing. David Vernon : Okay. Maybe just as a follow-up, as you think about the improved service, obviously, some business is under contract. Is that going to give you a better leverage to kind of get some even better than sort of run rate pricing going forward, or should we be thinking about that as being kind of the standard and you're going to be using service more to drive growth than to really try to extract more value from the existing book? Mark Wallace : Well, we attack it from all fronts, right. We're going to -- we've got long-term contracts with our customers, and there's rate escalators in there and we're going to -- but we're going to continue to grow with them and bring on more business and get price where we can get price. And again, we're not giving away our service. And so, we're going to attack it from all fronts. David Vernon : All right. Thanks guys. Operator : Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities. Your line is open. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask a question in terms of performance evaluation, and how you differentiate between performance improvements that may be associated with lower traffic volumes on the network versus improvements that would be associated with sustainable process optimization that would remain once volume growth returns? Kevin Boone : I think when we look at productivity, the way we measure it here internally, it is a lot easier to drive productivity and a growing volume environment because first, you got to -- in a declining market, you got to offset the decline in revenue before you even generate any productivity. So, the fact that we're able to offset the headwinds that we have talked about a lot on this call implies a lot of productivity this year, and there's a lot of smaller things that are adding up to big numbers across the board. When I look at the overtime percentages and I look at a lot of different things, those aren't being driven by lower volumes. That's a lot of blocking and tackling, even at the D&A side, we're getting a lot more productivity out of our employees than we ever have. So, we measure productivity internally. It's certainly harder to -- it would -- if I can tell you right now, we would have realized a lot more productivity this year in an increasing volume market if that was the outlook for us. Jim Foote : We can -- I mean, I -- we can look at the metrics and to Kevin's point, give me a growing environment, it's easier to run the railroad. Right now, we're in tough conditions to put up the numbers that we're putting. But ultimately, if you take a look at the metrics and where the metrics are sitting, how do you know that things are -- that we are improving even in the environment we're in, the cash is falling out. If we were hitting metrics and the cash wasn't falling out, then there'd be a point made, hey, it's easier and it's all because of volume base. But I think we've proven that, along with our metrics going in the right direction, the cash is falling out in the savings. Kevin Boone : And many of these changes are transformational in nature and therefore, sustainable. We are not just kicking the can down the road. We are fundamentally in every respect changing the way we run this Company, and these changes that are resulting in these efficiency gains are to a large degree is going to stay with us as we go forward. Cherilyn Radbourne : Okay. All of that makes sense. Maybe just by way of a quick follow-up, as operating ratios across the industry start to converge and maybe it's in the high-50s, what metrics do you think that investors should pivot to start focusing on to differentiate between the various franchises, whether it's ROIC, free cash flow conversion or some other metric? Kevin Boone : Cash flow, we talk about it a lot around here, I think we're pretty proud of our cash flow conversion. It's not easy to both improve OR and generate a lot of cash flow, and I think we've proven that. So that's really the differentiator that we see out there. And as we shift longer term, we're here to drive operating income growth as well. So those are the two things that I think we'll be focused on. Cherilyn Radbourne : That's all for me. Thank you. Operator : Jordan Alliger from Goldman. Your line is open. Jordan Alliger : Yes. Hi, just a quick question. We talked a lot on the coal side about the export front, can you touch base a little bit on the domestic side, and how much of that $300 million top line headwind might be tied to that or is it really all on the export side? Thanks. Mark Wallace : Yes. No. Sure. On the domestic side, there is some impact. I don't think it's going to be as much of a negative impact in 2020 as we've seen going forward. Net gas prices, unfortunately, have remained stubbornly low dropping to about $2 recently. But -- and we did not see the surge in prices that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018. When they hit like $4 for a couple of weeks. But for core -- for utility coal to be competitive, prices would have to increase from the current levels. And total electric demand would need to increase. Yes, as we all know in many locations, coal is used for peaking generation. And so, our upside is always seen or many cases seen when we have these extreme weather conditions and cold. Unfortunately, or fortunately, for the people on the call in the northern half of the country, you're not seeing a much cold weather, but that's bad for utility coal. So the natural gas capacity has not been stretched so far this year. But for 2020, we do see and we do expect that our utility tonnage will be relatively flat as we have had some wins, offsetting some market declines. Jordan Alliger : And just a quick follow-up on the coal pricing, does domestic coal revenue per carload, I mean, does that stay positive or is it positive? I shouldn't say stay, I'm not sure that's the question. Mark Wallace : There's going to be and they are on the domestic utility? Jordan Alliger : Yes. Mark Wallace : Well, again, it will be down, just given where things are. Those contracts are multi-year contracts with our customers. But there are price adjustments. But we have minimums in the contracts with all these tied to them, but we do expect a little bit of pressure on coal -- on utility RPU. Jordan Alliger : Great. Thank you very much. Mark Wallace : No problem. Operator : Ben Hartford from Baird. Your line is open. Ben Hartford : Okay. Thanks for getting me in here. Kevin, just had a perspective as we move beyond 2020 and the model evolves one -- toward one of a growth focus as this operating plan takes hold, this 59% OR target here for the full year for 2020 and as Mark had said, we're near trough level, cycle trough levels for PMI ratings and industrial related activity. To what extent, do you view 59% or thereabout as a representative trough or a floor for this model's OR as we look ahead to the next decade or so? Why would not that be the case? Kevin Boone : Why wouldn't 59% be the floor. Ben Hartford : Why couldn't 59% be the cycle floor for dealing with trough levels of PMI readings and we're looking out toward growth? Why shouldn't this 59% OR or thereabout be viewed as a representative trough for a floor for this model's OR going forward? Kevin Boone : You say floor, you're meaning that is -- why wouldn't it get better from here? Ben Hartford : Correct. Yes. Can we treat this as a cycle trough, this 59%, the low point? Kevin Boone : Well, I think as we look longer term and maybe Jim has some comments on this as well. We're really going to focus on growing operating income and generating EPS growth in the most effective way. We talked about the leverage we have we built in this model. So, we think, given everything that Jamie and his team have done that we can drop through revenue at a very high incremental margin, so that implies pretty good outcome on the margin side, but we'll have to think about what's the most effective way is to grow operating income and -- at a very high return. So those are the things that I think as we get further out, we'll have to contemplate. But it's -- we have a better service. So clearly, getting price for service as we'll go after and -- but it's really operating income and cash flow that we'll be striving for in the next few years beyond 2020. Jim Foote : Right at -- 42-or-so margins and as Kevin said, easier for that number as our -- for our margins to improve our operating ratio to go down with increasing volumes. Our long-term strategy is to continue to leverage our service, regain business that has been lost from the industry, while maintaining what I consider to be extremely good margins and grow our operating income, cash flow and earnings per share of the Company. Ben Hartford : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Ravi Shankar from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ravi Shankar : Thanks. [indiscernible]. Just a quick one, again on coal, you said that you probably hit the worst-ever 1Q and then things kind of normalize from there if the benchmark stays where it is. Given your, the kind of, take-or-pay as you have on the volume side and kind of the way the contract reset. If the benchmark stays where it is for, let's say, the next three to five years or forever, is all of the coal impact going to be isolated in 2020 or is there like another leg to come in 2021? Jim Foote : Oh my gosh Ravi. Coal benchmark stay here. That's not going to be happy. Ravi Shankar : Sorry, I'm making you do math at the end of the call. Jim Foote : Yes. Listen, I'm in no position to speculate what's going to happen to coal internationally, whether it's thermal, met. I mean, again thermal is going to be driven internationally by the demand for coal -- agility coal in India and other places, Turkey, Pakistan, it's going down. It's -- in the next 10 years, it's probably not going to -- we're not going to be shipping anymore to Europe. And on the met side, again, it's industrial production worldwide. It's cyclical. These things... Ravi Shankar : Right, right. I get that. I mean, I get that. We don't really have any visibility of where coal is going to go. But my point was, if it didn't change starting tomorrow, if it just stayed where it was, are your contracts all going to just lap and kind of completely reset in 2020 or is there more to come in 2021? Jim Foote : Yes. No it would keep going. They would last. Kevin Boone : There's not a contract that's going to expire in 2020, where there's another shoe to drop, so to speak on -- if the commodity -- underlying commodity prices to stay the same. I think what the volumes today represent is what the underlying commodity prices are at. So, all else equal, there is no long-term contracts within our export coal business that are set to expire after 2020. Ravi Shankar : Got it. That's what I was getting at. Maybe just one more kind of, you guys implied that you're going to see a significant incremental margins when the volumes come back, that kind of implies that you haven't necessarily downsized your operations completely for the cyclical volume environment you're seeing right now. Maybe some of the other rails have. If volumes don't come back until the back half of next year, at what point do you guys say that, hey, maybe we can cut some more on the cost side here? Kevin Boone : We watch this daily. It was kind of like, let's just kind of transition back six months ago when everybody was saying, man, in the second half of 2019, it's just going to be gangbusters, and we were saying, I don't see it. And we were responding accordingly and making the appropriate steps on the cost side to make sure that we delivered almost double-digit earnings growth this year in an extremely difficult environment, and we'll do the same this year as we go each and every month and assess where we are. And -- are the volumes better than or worse than what we expect them to be right now and we'll respond accordingly. Ravi Shankar : Very good. Thank guys. Operator : Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Walter Spracklin : Yes. Thanks very much. Thanks for sneaking me in here. I want to go back, Jim. You were talking a lot about the improvement in operating metrics that you had and how that's improving service and Mark is certainly echoing that. You mentioned about how you're using that to convince the truck customer to switch over. What evidence are you seeing that they are capitulating here and moving over, are they waiting for some other factor to consider? Is it -- or are you going to -- do you look at 2020 and see an opportunity for a notable share gain against truck coming up into 2020? Any thoughts on share gain opportunity against truck? Kevin Boone : Yes. Well, let me touch it real briefly. It took us decades, it took the railroad industry decades of poor service to drive the business off the railroads onto the trucks. We are not going to get the business off to highway back on to the railroad in two weeks. So we're going to have to earn it. As we were talking about earlier, we're going to have to not only put up good metrics but prove to the customers that these metrics are as equal to a truck and that this business model is sustainable. In the past, I'm sure they've had a lot of railroad guys that have walked in and said, hey, trust me take your business off to truck, put it on the railroad, I'll get it there on time. And the next thing six months later, it wasn't performing as well, and that customer lost business as a result of his conversion from truck to rail. He is skeptical and rightly so. We need to prove to that customer that this is a long-term, as I said, structural fundamental change in the way we do business. And when we do that, we'll continue to see where we grow our merchandise and intermodal volumes at a rate that is faster than the industry. Is that going to be 1% greater than the industry? Is that going to be 1.5% greater than the industry? It isn't going to be 12% greater than the industry. It's going to be incremental quarter after quarter after quarter, year after year after year, where we have outsized growth relative to the industry that's going to prove this business model. Walter Spracklin : Let me turn around and ask that same question now against your rail competitor. We've talked to a number of your customers, they've confirmed the service metric improvement. Jim, you've had experience of running -- working with a company that has had a significantly better operating ratio than its competitor. Is that an opportunity for share gain against rail if your operating metrics, as they have shown here, continue to improve and certainly, relative to the competitor, are we -- could we see a more notable upward shift in your share gain opportunity against your rail competitor? Jim Foote : Well, I think it's different than -- our business environment here in the eastern half of the United States as I would say, is significantly different than the business environment in Canada. We have billions of dollars of opportunity available to us from truck. Customers today that are shipping products with us in a boxcar that are also shipping 50% to 60% of their product in a truck because the truck is more reliable. I want that opportunity, which is billions. It is crazy for me to go over there and price my service as a commodity that try and pick up a couple of million bucks of the other railroad. That's the business model that has run the railroad industry down for decades. And that is not the business model that we are pursuing. Walter Spracklin : Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Appreciate the time. Operator : Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call and my question. Just wanted to talk, you made a lot of progress on the operations over the past few years. And you talked about the levers that you can pull in 2020. If you -- as you look at those, which ones do you feel could be the most challenging, particularly in this environment if there is anything? Jim Foote : The levers are always challenging. As we said, if we wanted to just take -- and I've been saying this for the last six, eight -- we have been saying this for the last six, eight, 10 months or more. If the business had dropped off 10%, 12% in a couple of weeks in a traditional kind of recession scenario, it would have been easier for us to go in there and find the equivalent amount of costs and take it out of the Company. When it was a slow drip week after week, month after month, a percent here, a percent in the half year and continue to down, down, down, down, down, it was more difficult for us to respond to that because we were fearful that we would -- and as we expressed again here today, we would cut service in areas where we were in an attempt to reduce cost, and we would perpetuate the downward trend by driving more business off the railroad and on to the highway. So that is a challenge, where can we cut and where can we maintain our levels of service. If the volumes continue to decline, it creates opportunities for us. And at some point in time, you just get a little more aggressive. We have not done that and -- but we have the ability, if it was necessary. Allison Poliniak : Great. And then just trying to be optimistic, if we do get may be even more significant inflection in the back half. Just any of those levers sort of get moderated or pull in a little bit? Kevin Boone : Boy, we're really -- we are optimistic. We like to think we're realistic. We are optimistic. We expect 80% of our business -- our merchandise business and our intermodal business to do quite well this year, especially as we said, in the second half of the year. If for no other reason, then we just get easier comps. And yes, if the business comes back, which clearly we hope it does, well, it's going to. Not a question, as I said, this is not the new norm. Business is going to come back. It is -- all of our businesses are cyclical. It's just a question of when does it come back. We're -- all we're saying is, as of right now, we're being a little more pessimistic about -- I don't expect all of a sudden volumes to jump up 5% in the -- on May 12. We're going to wait and see. We're going to be cautious. We're going to be vigilant in making -- and we have to do that in order to manage the Company. And if things come back, we'll be in a position to handle the volume and grow the business. Jamie? Jamie Boychuk : Look, as Jim said, this isn't slash-and-burn exercise that we've been going through. It's controlling the costs. And on the operating side, we work very, very close with Mark and his team. As the business starts to come back, we're going to be prepared for it. We're going to be ready for it. We've got the assets. We make sure we have the people, and we don't leave alone behind. So this is purely being a controlling -- and look, we need to continue to control the cost because the businesses are coming back as quick as we may have thought it does, then we'll do that. But we will be prepared to grab every carload that starts to come toward us. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions. Jim Foote : All right. Great. If there's no further questions thank you so much for joining us today and I look forward to seeing you on the road at the next conference or on the next call. Thank you. A - Kevin Boone : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call. You may disconnect your lines.",

During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Slater, Head of Investor Relations for CSX Corporation. Bill Slater : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Kevin Boone, Chief Financial Officer; and Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim Foote : Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining our call today. Before I get into the details of the first quarter, I want to say that our thoughts are with those who have been affected by the virus. No one ever imagined that we would be dealing with anything like this, but to see people everywhere respond to the challenge is uplifting. With the beginning of the transformation of CSX, just a few years ago, we adopted a few tenets by which to operate. First, be safe. The employee should never be injured while on the job. Second, help our customers be successful by providing them with good service. And third, operate as efficiently as possible. We knew that if we did those three things, we would be a great company and shareholders would be rewarded. We clearly did not change how we operate with a pandemic in mind. But because of the intense adoption of those core beliefs, CSX is now a much stronger and resilient company and in the best possible position to respond to this unprecedented and uncertain environment. I am incredibly proud of the men and women of CSX who are working on the front lines. They have once again showed what outstanding railroaders they are. CSX is running at peak condition, keeping the nation\u2019s supply chain moving and delivering critical products to millions of Americans. Thousands of customers trust CSX with their freight and every one of them right now is experiencing some degree of disruption. And we are deeply committed to maintain the best-in-class service they have come to expect from us. I am proud to say that service is currently the best it has ever been. Now let\u2019s go to Slide 5 of the presentation for highlights of the first quarter financial performance. First quarter EPS declined 2% to $1. While the operating ratio improved by 80 basis points to 58.7%, a new Class I railroad first quarter record. Given the combination of the known headwinds this year from export coal and other non-core items as well as the initial impact from the pandemic in the final weeks of the quarter, these results are impressive. Moving to Slide 6, first quarter revenues declined 5%, as merchandise growth was more than offset by declines in coal and other revenue. Merchandise revenue increased 3% on 2% higher volumes as broad-based volume growth across markets was partially offset by declines in automotive and fertilizers. Excluding automotive, merchandise revenue and volume were up 5% and 4% respectively. Intermodal revenue decline 1% on flat volumes as domestic revenue and volume growth was more than offset by declines in the international business. Excluding the COVID-19 impact from the final weeks of the quarter, international volume would have been positive as well. Coal revenues decreased 25% on 15% lower volumes. Both the domestic and export markets continue to be negatively impacted by natural gas prices, weak export demand and benchmark prices. Other revenue declined 40%, representing a 2% headwind to total revenue, due to lapping a favorable customer contract settlement last year and lower demurrage and intermodal storage revenues. Turning to Slide 7 and our safety performance where we again showed improvement. This quarter was one of the safest in CSX\u2019s history. The personal injury rate declined 22% and the train accident rate declined 34% with both figures approaching all-time company records. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 8 and review our operating performance. CSX continued to operate at an extremely high level during what is typically the most seasonally difficult quarter, setting first quarter records for velocity, dwell and car miles per day. Additionally, CSX continues to lead U.S. Class I railroads in fuel efficiency, operating at 1 gallon of fuel per 1,000 gross ton miles. Improving fuel efficiency is a top priority for the team and we are proud of our success. Fuel efficiency initiatives over the last several years have reduced annual diesel consumption by approximately 60 million gallons. The emissions avoided from this reduction are the equivalent of planting almost 1 million acres of forest each year, and we\u2019re challenging ourselves to be even better. CSX recently became the first U.S. Class I railroad to have its long-term emission intensity reduction goal approved by the Science-Based Target Initiative. Reducing emissions is important to us, our customers and the communities we serve. Critically as shown on Slide 9, our operating performance continues to drive best-in-class service and reliability for our customers. Trip plan performance is the best it has ever been with 84% of merchandise carloads and 98% of intermodal containers currently meeting their hourly trip plans in April so far. This performance includes the implementation of substantial service design changes in recent weeks to adjust our network and response to the current lower volumes. Let me turn it over now to Kevin for more detail on the quarter. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. As you will see in my review of the first quarter financial results, CSX was once again able to drive significant efficiency gains, hosting yet another quality operating ratio record by the top line headwinds Jim described. This quarter marks three years since the transformation of CSX, and while there remains considerable uncertainty around the severity and duration of the economic impact related to the pandemic, CSX has never been in a stronger position to take this unique challenge. Our liquidity position is extremely strong with nearly $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of March. This represents the multiples of what we would consider normal targeted cash levels. You can also imagine we have run quite a few scenarios over the past several weeks. Every model we\u2019ve run has this substantial liquidity emerging in a stronger position from this downturn and leveraging the subsequent recovery. All of these scenarios will soon react and adapt our business to changing conditions, and we have already begun to quickly adjust to the current environment. From a financial perspective, we have taken many proactive steps to position the company to endure the economic downturn. First, we have ensured our cash position is liquid and available, shifting the majority of our cash investment to safer government funds for the time being. While we would like to be earning more on our cash we have taken a very conservative position until we are comfortable, conditions have normalized. We also raised an incremental $500 million of debt, taking advantage of what are historically low interest rates. But I look out over the next 36 months; we have less than $1 billion in debt maturities, which could easily be funded through our annual free cash flow. We continue to closely monitor our receivable balance and I\u2019m not seeing any significant change to our aging profile. Our transportation services remain critical to our customers and their ability to generate cash flow. Finally, while the current backdrop is challenging, we are realizing opportunities and efficiencies that we will be able to leverage when we return to growth. These environments provide an opportunity to evaluate every cost and challenge the way we do things, and I expect the savings to be durable when growth returns. Now turning my attention to Slide 11. I\u2019ll walk you through the highlights of the summary income statement. As Jim mentioned, total revenue was down 5% in the first quarter. A significant decline in coal, lower other revenue and unfavorable mix more than offset the benefits of merchandise gains. Moving to expenses, total operating expenses were 7% lower than first quarter, driven almost entirely by the strong gains in operating efficiency we once again delivered. Labor and fringe expense was 10% lower versus the first quarter of 2019, as the average employee count was down 1,600 or 7%. Notably, even with volume directly flat year-over-year in the first quarter, we continued to find opportunities to tighten the train plan. First quarter crew starts were down 11% versus the prior year. This is a year-over-year average for the quarter and reflects efficiency gains we made over the last 12 months. Starting in the second half of March and through April to-date, we have reacted to the declining volume environment and have continued to aggressively reduce train starts. I\u2019m sure Jamie will touch on this in the Q&A. I have also talked a lot about our focus on overtime the last few quarters, and once again, we saw a significant 33% reduction year-over-year. With current volume headwinds, we expect to continue to drive significant improvement and overtime spend. In addition to these gains and employee efficiency, we also had $14 million of lower incentive comp expense in the quarter. Finally, $10 million of other labor cost increases were primarily driven by the cycling of the railroad retirement tax refunds in the prior year. MS&O expense improved 4% versus the prior year. Continued efficiency improvements across the operating support departments, including significant reductions in engineering, contracted spend, terminal expense and crew travel, drove a $32 million reduction year-over-year in MS&O. While MS&O is traditionally less volume variables and labor costs; a month ago, we began to work to eliminate discretionary spending across the company, most of what will show up on this line item. Reductions in active locomotives and freight cars will also drive MS&O savings, and we expect outsourced terminal costs to adjust down as well. While MS&O will not be down one-for-one with volume, we are clearly focused on costs within this bucket that are traditionally less volume variable. Real estate and line sale gains of $18 million or $9 million lower in the quarter, while there continued to be a pipeline of these opportunities; sales activity is likely to be lower over the balance of the year given current economic conditions. That said, we have already closed one transaction in April and expect gains in the second quarter to be relatively flat with the first quarter. Fuel expense was $41 million favorable, an 18% improvement year-over-year driven by a 12% decrease in the per gallon price as well as significant efficiency improvement in lower volume. Our continued focus on utilization of distributed power and energy management software combined with train handling rules compliance for the first quarter of record fuel efficiency. Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $14 million or 4% in the quarter, which reflects a $10 million impact in the fourth quarter 2019 depreciation study, which will continue to impact year-over-year depreciation expense for the next two quarters. We still expect full-year depreciation to be up $50 million to $60 million. Equipment, rent expense, decreased 8%. Improved network performance has enabled faster car cycle times as measured by merchandise and intermodal days per load, which include 6% and 13% respectively. This combined with lower payable volumes with the majority of the savings and equipment rents. Going forward, we will see volume related reductions and equipment rent expense. So, these will be partially offset by lower car utilization. In addition, we expect lower equity earnings from our TTX affiliate, which also show up in equipment rents. Turning below the line. Interest expense increased primarily due to higher debt balances, partially offset by a lower all-in coupon. The income tax expense increased $30 million as lower pre-tax earnings were more than offset by prior year benefits related to option exercises investing with other equity awards. Absent unique items, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5% for future quarters. Closing out the P&L. As Jim highlighted in his opening remarks, CSX operating income declined 3% year-over-year, while the first quarter operating ratio of 58.7 representing an 80 basis point improvement. Turning to the cash side of the equation on Slide 12. In the first quarter of 2020, capital investment was up slightly year-over-year. We continue to invest in our core track, bridge and signal infrastructure and we continue to prioritize investments that provide safe and reliable train operations, but we are evaluating our capitals in total even during this downturn and volumes, our commitment to invest in the safety of our core infrastructure will not change. In the first quarter, free cash flow before dividends, that\u2019s $812 million, down slightly reflecting higher capital expenditures and lower proceeds from property disposition. Free cash flow has continued to be a key focus for this team and we saw free cash flow conversion exceed 100%. The company continues to demonstrate a commitment to shareholder distribution including dividend payments. Importantly, I mentioned previously, our cash in short-term investment balance entering second quarter is nearly $2.5 billion. This position gives us confidence that combined with efficiency initiatives; we can not only weather the storm in front of us, but take advantage of opportunities that may present themselves to create long-term value for shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Foote : Great. Thank you, Kevin. Concluding on slide 14, due to the uncertain economic environment, and this should be of no surprise to anyone, we are withdrawing our guidance for the year. The potential range of outcomes for both production and demand, as well as the potential shape of the recovery are too wide to predict at this time. We are constantly assessing the economic situation and we\u2019ll respond like we always do by taking appropriate steps to control costs, but with an ever vigilant eye toward maintaining current, but most importantly, long-term service for our customers, we have worked too hard to get this right to go backwards. We are also evaluating our capital expenditure outlook for the year. Our first priority is and always will be the reliability and integrity of our railroad. We will not reduce or defer any spend that impacts safety. We will install about the same amount of rail and more balance this year than last. And Kevin and his team are looking for materials buying opportunities. We are however identifying potential areas of efficiency within our capital plan and the opportunities to defer some non-essential spend. The plan will be a fine as the year progresses, but currently, expect capital expenditures at the low end of our initial $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion range. Importantly, CSX entered into this period with a dramatically different cash flow profile than at any point in the company\u2019s history. Over the course of our transformation, we have more than doubled CSX\u2019s free cash flow conversion and ended the quarter with almost $2.5 billion of cash in short-term investments and an untapped revolver. We will take the necessary steps to ensure sufficient liquidity. These are unprecedented times. I\u2019ve been through a lot in my career from Black Monday to the Great Recession and a lot of other unsettling events, but nothing like this. But I can say with certainty, long companies adapt, they make changes and they get even stronger. I hope this current situation is pet situation passes soon and we settle into the new normal. But for sure, the best is yet to come for CSX. Bill? Bill Slater : Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time, I would ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question. Also, we ask everyone to please bear with us as we work through the logistical challenges presented by joining today\u2019s call from different locations. With that, we will now take questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from line of Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Amit Mehrotra : thanks, operator. thanks everybody for taking my questions and congrats on the cost performance in the quarter is pretty impressive. Kevin, I think it would just be really helpful to get some help on how we can think about decremental margins in the second quarter. We\u2019re obviously facing 20% plus volume declines, the 25%, 26% decremental as you guys achieved in the first quarter was great, but obviously, facing maybe, a more benign volume environment than what we\u2019re going to get in the second quarter. So, just any way to think about that and since I only get one question, if you can just also comment on how the pricing environment has evolved, if at all, in the context of the volume declines? Thanks a lot. Kevin Boone : Yes, Amit. I think that qualifies as two, and I\u2019ll give you a pass, let me do the first one going today. look, I knew the decremental margin question would come up on this call and we talked about it a lot and I know you want to plug into your models, a certain decremental margin given your assumption here, I can give you a framework, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to lay out necessarily what the decremental margins could be, because there\u2019s a lot of different scenarios that could occur. What we\u2019re really focused on in this environment is taking out structural costs and really, on the other side of this really emerging and quite frankly, a better position to that maybe we would have had this not happen. So, but just going through the P&L here, obviously, the depreciation is a cost that\u2019s more something that in the near-term and medium-term is more difficult to go after. We\u2019ve done a great job on becoming more capital efficient that will work its way through depreciation over time. But that\u2019s something in the near-term that\u2019s obviously part of the move. When we look at our labor costs, as I described in the script, we obviously, with the great work, that Jamie and his team have done, eliminating train starts and other things, we\u2019re seeing headcount and reduced labor come out pretty significantly with the lower volume environment that we\u2019re seeing. MS&O as your experience will tell you, it includes a lot of different items. When I look across MS&O and how we look at it internally, traditionally, we\u2019ve said about 30% is highly variable, and then you have the rest of it, 25%, we\u2019ve generally said it\u2019s less \u2013 structurally less variable. But those are the things that we have to look at in this environment to really go after. And so that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to challenge ourselves. Clearly the rent expense from a car hire perspective shouldn\u2019t move the volume, but there are some offsetting relationships where we want to earn as much on our fleet, in terms of rents. And then the TTX relationship obviously creates somewhat of a less volume related upside that we will traditionally see. So there\u2019s a lot of pieces, we\u2019re not going to draw the line in the sand on what the decremental margins are. I can tell you what we have done is we\u2019re taking a review of everything. Our challenge here is to variabilize every cost we can, reevaluate it and the working conditions today, working from home and all of those, I think are introducing opportunities for more efficiency for us. So we\u2019re driving those, will react as a volume plays out here over the next quarter or two. And I think you\u2019ll see additional opportunities that will drive. Mark Wallace : Maybe I\u2019ll take the second part of that first question. I think that was cheap but probably going to be a reoccurring theme throughout the afternoon here. The pricing story continues to be very strong. I think if you look at the RPU results, the RPU is a mixed story, not \u2013 and I\u2019ll repeat again, it\u2019s not a pricing story. Pricing continues to be very good. Same-store sales sequentially in year-over-year are very, very good and our negotiated contracts exceeded our same-store sales pricing. So the team is doing an exceptional job in these circumstances to extract good value for the transportation product that we are delivering to our customers, which is Jim and both and Kevin said continues to be outstanding. So I\u2019m very, very pleased the team has done a phenomenal job and has delivered great results on the pricing side. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. Although, the question I\u2019m going to focus on here is the rate of decline that we\u2019re seeing in the second quarter. And Mark, maybe if you can speak to that, I mean, I think we show your volume down about 20% so far in April. Do you have any indications from customers when they plan to reopen sites or go back to higher levels of shipping or have we not even felt potentially the bottom of it yet? Mark Wallace : Brandon, I would say, my crystal ball is probably as good as yours. In this uncertain environment things are so fluid. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re continuing to stay very, very close to our customers. I know the team while working remotely is staying very close to customers, reaching out to them on a weekly basis and trying to get a feel for their business, the impact to their business, how that affects the supply chain, what we can do to react. What I would say is these times are very uncertain and customers are seeing the same sort of things that we are. So we\u2019re doing what we can control and that\u2019s continuing to provide our customers with the best possible service and watching the volumes very closely. Jamie and I talk every day and sometimes way more than once and our teams do as well. And we\u2019re doing an exceptional job of staying on top of things, but I can tell you, once our customers reopen and things come back to normal, so to speak we\u2019re going to be there to provide exceptional service for them and be there for them when they get back. So there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. As I said, clearly the automotive guys are down. We hear the public reports that those facilities, those plants will be open sometime in early May, around May 4. I think GM said today, they may push some of those plants back a week or two. But we\u2019re staying very, very close to them. We have weekly calls with all our customers and especially the automotive guys and we\u2019re just watching it and seeing what happens. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Allison Landry : Good afternoon. Thanks. So in past, you\u2019ve said that you still had many cost levers to pull as part of ongoing PSR implementation. So does the current downturn in volumes provided opportunity to speed up some of those remaining initiatives? So if you could speak to an acceleration of cost takeouts and also any other changes in the network that you might be able to pull forward that, would potentially put you guys in an even better position to benefit from a recovery sooner than you might have otherwise? Thank you. Jim Foote : Thanks Allison. I\u2019ve talked many times about the difficulties associated with the decline on a gradual basis over the last 12 to 18 months associated with a stagnant industrial economy. And that we can respond quicker, when there are downturns. And the job that the team did in responding over the last four weeks in essence, not counting the international intermodal, let\u2019s start a little bit earlier, but over the last, a short period of time that responding to this quick downturn was nothing short of amazing. Jamie, why don\u2019t you talk about all of the steps that you guys took? Jamie Boychuk : Sure, absolutely. We \u2013 obviously over the past few weeks here, we\u2019ve really started to adjust our network to what we\u2019re seeing as a current \u2013 the current environment and the way that demand sits. So we\u2019ve made a lot of changes out there where we\u2019ve reduced over the last couple of weeks, a number of our assets. But really we\u2019ve reduced our total road starts by 23% year-over-year against the 25% decline in volume. We stored over 400 locomotives since the end of March driving our active locomotive count under 2,000. To put that in perspective, three years ago when we started scheduled railroading at CSX, we had over 4,000 locomotives. We also held our merchandise train link consistent, yet we\u2019ve been able to eliminate over 500 merchandise trains from our daily plan, which has more than a 20% - sorry, 50 merchandise trains from our daily plan, which is more than a 20% reduction. While we\u2019ve been doing all that, we\u2019ve been able to reduce our train delays by over 66%. So I think it\u2019s really important to know that these changes are not just volume related that we started, really right off the start, ready for growth, working with Mark and his team while they were driving with customers. Now, we\u2019re really starting to pivot and use the current environment to go after structural opportunities in our operation. We will continue to adjust our network as demand dictates going forward, but we are also making changes where assets will not need to come back in the future. This is really an exercise for us to continue to work close with our marketing team, adjust our volumes and network each and every day. But at the same time, we are ready when volume returns to go after that volume and not leave a carload behind. Allison Landry : Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please go ahead. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good afternoon. Remarkable job on the cost side, very impressive how quickly you\u2019ve responded. Wanted to get your thoughts, Mark or Jim, just in terms of, how does the \u2013 I guess, I mean, when the markets moved so much, maybe it\u2019s irrelevant. But how do you interact with customers in terms of you\u2019ve got to cut costs and is the kind of share gain versus truck story, something you can kind of put on hold and say, we\u2019ll revisit it in another year? Or is it something that you kind of gauge the way \u2013 you manage the way you cut costs so that you still have that service and kind of dialogue from before. I mean, it seems like it\u2019s kind of an incremental question in a market that\u2019s big, very macro driven. But how do you think about that relative to the obvious success in cutting a lot of costs? Jim Foote : Tom, as I said in my opening remarks, we have worked like dogs to get these service levels of this railroad up to where they belong and to win back credibility from our customers. And so we are \u2013 first of all and Mark can follow up on this, but Mark and Jamie, as Jamie said, are in constant communication with each other and making sure that our customers are aware of what service changes we need to make and what the impacts to our customers may be. And in many circumstances, the reason \u2013 again, the reason that we\u2019re reducing train starts is because their volumes are down and all we need to do is to have an honest dialog with our customers about the fact that we don\u2019t think we can serve them five days a week, how about three. And they go, sure, let me do, make the necessary adjustments, where it is appropriate. But Mark and his team are, as he said constantly communicating with the customers about that. Mark, why don\u2019t you follow up? Mark Wallace : Yes, sure. Jim is exactly right. We\u2019re talking with our customers, clearly where they\u2019re seeing volume declined because their own businesses and their businesses are softer. And we have an opportunity to maybe take a day out of the service or whatever. We\u2019re having those conversations and we\u2019re staying close to Jamie and making those changes. Service is safe around here and our commitment to our customers is important. And we take that responsibility very, very importantly. And as Jim said, we\u2019ve worked really, really hard over the last three years to put in the reliability and the consistency of service that customers expect from us. We\u2019re doing that. We continue to do that and we\u2019re not going to \u2013 just because volumes are declining, we\u2019re not going to walk away from that strategy. And so we\u2019re continuing to work with everybody. And listen, I think the weekly carloads are showing that, I mean, we \u2013 with our better service and as I\u2019ve talked many times, we have repositioned our marketing teams to really get away from just being placing people to really understanding and doing real marketing work and looking for opportunities for us to gain share from other modes of transportation. And they\u2019re going to continue that, I\u2019m not sending them home for a year just because their volumes are down. They\u2019re going to continue to work. We\u2019re winning in the marketplace. We\u2019re uncovering opportunities with our better service products to win share from other modes of transportation, and I think you\u2019re seeing it in the carload. So we\u2019re having tremendous success there and that work\u2019s going to continue. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. You had a few comments on fuel efficiency. I wanted to circle back to that. I think going to the 2018 Investor Day, the thought was about 0.95%. It\u2019s probably the only target you didn\u2019t hit early from that outlook. So I just wanted to hear, can you still get to that number? It sounds like a lot of efficiency gains you\u2019re making now aren\u2019t necessarily volume dependent. So just wanted to see what were the main factors to drive that if that goal was still potentially on the table? Jim Foote : Jamie, you want to take that? Jamie Boychuk : Yes, absolutely. Look, fuel is something that we talk about consistently here at CSX. And everyone on our team, on the operating team knows clearly where our targets and our goals are with respect to that. We are using technology constantly to make sure that we hit those targets as we continue to break through new records each and every quarter as we move forward. We feel confident that we will continue to show the improvement that we have in the past and we\u2019ll continue to move that forward. Definitely as our \u2013 as we fill out our trains, we make our trains bigger and longer that helps with the efficiency, where two locomotives are pulling more freight than they were before as we consolidate trains and as we continue to move forward into volume growth at some point in time when the market conditions change. But, yes, it\u2019s an important key factor. I\u2019ve got an unbelievable operating team who is working on this. We have created our own small department of a few individuals who are solely concentrating on fuel efficiency and those people will continue to do what they\u2019re doing and driving the metrics to where we\u2019re seeing them. Jim Foote : I guess we\u2019ll take an A minus on one of our \u2013 one of the categories. Brian Ossenbeck : All right, thanks, Jamie. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good afternoon. Hope all is well and safe. And Jim, you\u2019ve always provided good insight into kind of the calling the volume outlook. Maybe just talk a bit about, more about keeping the costs around if you anticipate a quick bounce back, given the speed of the decline compared to suffering with some higher costs in the near term. And I guess I\u2019m more specifically referring to employees and how you think about furloughing or cutting additional employees with the ability to get them back up and running quickly. Jim Foote : Well, Ken, that has been the number one area of concentration for me for the last month is trying to deal with not only making sure that we have the employees ready, willing and able when as this business turns around, but to make sure because of the tragic circumstances both with the disease and the economic fallout at the same time to make sure that we were very humanitarian in the way we\u2019ve approached things. We have been working diligently with the labor unions from day one and have come up with some unique arrangements to address those concerns recognizing the fact that the future is clearly unknown in terms of how long this is going to last. And so we\u2019ve done a lot of interesting and unique things in conjunction with labor, especially in the early days to keep the employees working and then to be able to pivot, to adjust in a manner when volumes really began to decline, but to make sure we have access to those employees when things turn back. So we have been thinking way outside the box to try and come up with ideas wherever we can. And right now I feel we\u2019re as in a good position as one could be in that circumstance. I wish I had a crystal ball in terms of future volumes, but right now we just don\u2019t have that. Ken Hoexter : So, I guess just to clarify\u2026 Jamie Boychuk : Just on some of the points that Jim kind of put out there was we have \u2013 with our union groups we have set up some agreements that will allow our employees to go on what we call a retention board. It\u2019s their choice \u2013 sorry, it\u2019s a reserve board. It\u2019s their choice to get on that board or not. Most of our employees, a large number of them have decided to go on to that board, instead of taking furlough on the T&E side. And the benefits for us, and of course these are tough decisions that we\u2019re making as we continue to work on this downturn and control our costs, but the benefits is a less carrying cost for us, but it allows the employees to have medical benefits and other benefits along the way. That gives us, in most cases, a 48-hour recall for when the volume starts to come back, we don\u2019t have to wait the normal period which is around a 15-day recall cycle. We\u2019re able to jump on volumes as Mark and his team work on as the economic conditions change. Ken Hoexter : Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Jamie. Appreciate the insight. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Please go ahead. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe a question on intermodal and I guess maybe two pieces to it. I guess, first, when you think about sort of the customer mix and what you guys are moving both on the international and the domestic side, is there any sense that you can give us to sort of what is maybe more consumer and sort of essential type businesses that could be operating kind of what the floor might be like in that? And then, secondarily, in times of disruption like this, do you tend to see modal shift occur? Obviously, truck spot rates have gone down quite a bit here, but that typically isn\u2019t the sort of measure that you guys tell us to look to in terms of how to think about share between truck and rail, it\u2019s more contractual. So just want to get a sense of maybe how that kind of plays out when you\u2019re in a very disrupted state like we\u2019re in right now. Jim Foote : Mark? Mark Wallace : Sure. Thanks. So when we started off the quarter, modal was doing quite well. We had the traditional Chinese New Year on the international side, where volumes were reduced significantly. And then because of COVID-19, the outbreak in China, with the extended shutdowns, we sort of saw a pause on the international front for quite some time. Meanwhile, the domestic side of the business was doing actually pretty well. I think as people saw what was happening, here was a lot of inventory being moved out of the warehouses and positioned to stores in anticipation of the increased demand and so we saw that dynamic. And then China opened up a little bit later in the quarter. We saw some international volumes come in, and then meanwhile, the domestic side of the business was slowing down considerably. So right now, as we look out, a lot of reports out there about the demand equation and clearly with a lot of the shutdowns, the retail businesses are closed, there\u2019s not a lot of demand for things. And so with a lot of price ceiling on the international front and we expect that our domestic intermodal business will slow down considerably and is slowing down considerably now and for the foreseeable future. So those are sort of the dynamic shifts that have been going on. Service is tremendous. Our on-time performance is in the high 90s; 98%, 99%. We\u2019re seeing \u2013 so as it pertains to truck, the trucking environment was tight and then it loosened up quite significantly and it\u2019s pretty fluid now. So we have to continue doing what we\u2019re doing, providing great service to our customers. Clearly, competition from the trucks. There\u2019s a lot of trucks out there and we\u2019re going to compete harder and try to win some business, but that\u2019s kind of the environment right now. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That\u2019s a very helpful color. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Afternoon, guys. Jim Foote : Hey, Scott. Scott Group : So Kevin, last quarter you talked about some specific headwinds. I think it was $300 million or so in coal revenue, $90 million lower gains, $50 million in the other railway revenue. I don\u2019t know if those are so impacted by what\u2019s going on. So maybe just a comment if you think any of those have materially changed. And then, Mark, for you just quickly, have we seen the full impact of the benchmarks in coal RPU or is there one more leg down to come here? Kevin Boone : Yes, I\u2019ll cover a few of those headwinds. I think on the previous call I mentioned real estate sales, last year was about $160 million. We\u2019ve guided for this full year of $50 million. Based on my comments we\u2019ll probably see something a little bit south of that $60 million. The market is fluid right now. We obviously feel sequentially the number will be in line with the first quarter. Fourth quarter is probably a little bit more uncertain depending on the marketing condition that exists today. We\u2019re certainly not going to buy or sell anything and we have plenty of cash and we\u2019re going to maximize value, of course. And then on the depreciation as I described, $50 million to $60 million headwind primarily related to the group life study. There is obviously non-cash, but it\u2019s impacting the income statement on that side. From a culture cycle, I\u2019ll let Mark talk a little bit more about that, but I don\u2019t think in aggregate that that headwind has changed and the market is probably somewhat similar, but I\u2019ll let Mark touch on that. Mark Wallace : Yes. No, thanks, Kevin. Scott, yes, I would say, I don\u2019t know. I would say the benchmarks are sort of all over the place. I think from what we told you in Q4 in January, I think from a benchmark perspective, we\u2019re still sort of thinking the same thing quarterly, a little bit of weakness on API to prices, a little bit less of a factor now because a lot of coal is going to Europe. But most of our coal \u2013 lot of our coals, especially on the thermal side, is going to India. India is closed down for a month. When that reopens, anybody\u2019s guess. So, no coal is going to India right now. So, those dynamics are happening. The net benchmark came up a little bit, those are re-priced quarterly. So, clearly as Jim said, in his opening, coals have some headwinds. We didn\u2019t foresee any of these coal dynamics, when we were talking to you in January, the markets have changed dramatically. So, there\u2019s clearly some headwinds out there and benchmarks are one, but the demand is clearly, the driving force here. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Ross from Stifel. Please go ahead. David Ross : Yes. good afternoon, gentlemen. And maybe, this is a question for Jamie. You talked about mix specifically, are there any commodity types that you hauled that either help or hurt overall network productivity that might be harder to handle or sort of the network for some reason? For example, if auto is not around, is that a good thing or is there any other commodity type that might limit network efficiency? Jamie Boychuk : Yes. Look at \u2013 on the operating end of things, of course, we\u2019ve really only got three different types of commodity. Our type of trains, I guess we would say. So, you\u2019ve got our bulk service, which is easier, lower costs in most circumstances in cases. And then we have our merchandise, which is usually handled multiple times throughout a network, by the time, it gets from online or from customer to customer. With respect to the auto side of the business, I would say that it is \u2013 it\u2019s heavily on our network. It\u2019s very customer-based with respect to a lot of work done at the loading facilities and unloading facilities. So, there are a number of yards and locals, and we do have some dedicated auto trains that run in certain parts of the network. So, when it comes to cutting off auto, even though it\u2019s a revenue that we don\u2019t want to lose and it\u2019s a good revenue for us. There\u2019s, you can pull out a lot of costs with respect to auto when the auto network shuts down the way it did. David Ross : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jordan Alliger : Yes, just a quick question. Obviously, most of the volume environment\u2019s pretty tough right now, but as some buffer comes from agriculture, agricultural products, is that something that might actually not look that bad in the grand scheme of things? Thanks. Jim Foote : Well, it\u2019s certainly, freight commodities got a little different cycle to it. I think we\u2019re looking at, as an example, a reasonably good movement of fertilizer now, because that\u2019s the time of the year to do that. And I think everybody\u2019s still planning on planting a crop this year. And then in all the various buckets, a lot of them, again, as you said, agricultural, it has its own cycle based upon its commodity. It\u2019s not tied to auto production as an example. Jordan Alliger : So there is, as you said, a different cycle than the rest of the industrial, so maybe, there could be some hope on that volume product? Jim Foote : Yes, there\u2019s \u2013 certainly, yes. Certainly each element has its own drivers so to speak. And auto as an example has \u2013 is one thing that impacts a lot of different groups within the industrial and merchandise segment. And but yes, there are certain elements. I mean there\u2019s been a still be some coal is going to move. Like I said, fertilizer\u2019s going to move, grains going to get harvested. We\u2019ve always relied on that grains in one straight shape or another to keep the railroads going, whether it\u2019s corn, wheat, or beer. Jordan Alliger : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Please go ahead. Justin Long : Thanks and good afternoon. So, one of the noticeable trends year-to-date has been the outperformance of your volumes versus your eastern rail competitor. So, I was wondering if you could comment on how much of that outperformance in your opinion is coming as a function of market share gains from that rail competitor, market share gains from truck and mix. And maybe, as you answer that question, you could also address the lower fuel price environment and how you\u2019re thinking about the modal share impact from that going forward as well. Thanks. Jim Foote : Mark? Mark Wallace : Sorry, I was doing something else, I apologize. We are seeing share, a good share gains across the portfolio. What\u2019s our strategy when we started this thing was to put in place the best service product that we could. We\u2019re doing that we continue to do that. Next, we are focused on the sales and marketing organization is really focused on three things. Number one, because of the superior service that we have working with our existing customers to expand the amount of rail they use. Number two, work with customers to use to have \u2013 used to move freight with CSX, but for some reason over the last couple years, have pursued various reasons might have gone away. We\u2019re working hard with those customers to bring that story back home I would say. And the third strategy is working with shippers, who may have traditionally never used rail in the past, but have always looked at trucking easier to do business with and never were really wanted to consider rail as an option, because of the work that we\u2019re doing to make it easier to do business with, because of our cost profile, we\u2019re able to go into some of those markets now that our marketing team is identifying and looking at enabled and being able to win share there. For instance, we\u2019ve been very successful in one segment in the business of aggregates. Aggregates continue to be a very strong commodity for us these days. There\u2019s a lot of road construction projects that are going on. Traditionally, a lot of that coming out of like from Georgia into middle of about Florida. And less than 300 miles used to move by truck, because we had the capacity, because we had the service, we\u2019re able to play in those markets and make a very good return by doing so. And the contribution on that is very good. So, we\u2019re very \u2013 so, we\u2019re looking at all these different buckets of opportunities. The teams are being very aggressive. And I think as you said in your question, you can see it in the results you see on a weekly basis. Jim Foote : Justin, on your comment about the dynamics between the rail versus truck in the impact that lower fuel prices might have. Where\u2019s the \u2013 that\u2019s one of the reasons why we continue to work so hard to make sure we reduce our fuel efficiency is, so that we can be more competitive with the highway. But there have been a number of a recent independent surveys that are out there right now, where they ask customers you\u2019re still planning \u2013 what do you think about rail transportation. is it reliable? yes. It\u2019s fantastic, yes. Or you like leadership probably a little bit more than I was in the past? Is there still value to shipping rail versus truck? Well, maybe it\u2019s not 15%, when oil is negative 35%. But they still stay at 10%, 10% cheaper with the same truck like service is extremely compelling in the marketplace. Justin Long : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Appreciate the responses. Jim Foote : Right, Justin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead. David Vernon : Hey, good afternoon. Kevin, question for you on the balance sheet side, you\u2019ve got about $2 billion of the cash, obviously, ample liquidity, the cash flow position and business is good. Are you guys going to get back to a more aggressive capital return through buyback or are you thinking about changing in a way you\u2019re going to be returning some of that capital to investors emphasizing more of the dividend and any changing thoughts on that the capital return profile going forward? Kevin Boone : Yes, it\u2019s a \u2013 clearly, it\u2019s a dynamic market right now. We\u2019re very happy and to have $2.5 billion of cash and balance sheet and growing every day, I was still generating positive free cash flows. So that\u2019s clearly, we look over the medium term and even long-term, that\u2019s not a cash balance that we are going to need on the balance sheet. And we still feel distributing this to our shareholders is something that we\u2019ll prioritize going forward when the buybacks will continue for you to discuss that over the next few months. But I would expect that at some point for that to be still a core component of our cash returns to shareholders. I mentioned on the opening remarks that we\u2019re committed to our dividend. It\u2019s something that we re-evaluate every year. We just recently this year increased that. And so we\u2019ll see what we do next year. but again, we\u2019re generating significant free cash flow even in these marketing conditions and we can cover that dividend as we continue to be committed to the shareholder returns. David Vernon : All right. Thank you. Maybe, if I can tweak one quick follow-up in. Jim, or is there anything on the policy side you\u2019re looking at coming out of DC that would be beneficial or game-changing beyond obviously, the economy just restarting, anything in infrastructure spending or stuff like that that we should be keeping an eye on that would have an outside impact on CSX? Jim Foote : Nothing that is game changing. We\u2019re clearly interested in any cause of financial stimulus that would involve infrastructure, because that would be a benefit to us. But no, so far to-date, the government in terms of providing flexibility to the rail industry, to be able to operate and maintain all of the safety requirements, especially with the ad hoc nature of the way some of this was implemented in the States. We have not really been implemented \u2013 impacted and the government\u2019s been very cooperative with us. David Vernon : All right. thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Walter Spracklin : Yes, thanks very much. Good afternoon everyone. I guess, if we were to look out beyond COVID-19 and understanding that there\u2019s the world in the future is not going to be \u2013 we\u2019re not going back to normal and there could be some opportunities that emerge in that new normal, Jim. When you look at how the world might develop post COVID-19, how it\u2019s structurally different, is there anything that a railroad or CSX in particular can do to capitalize on a new normal that is just different from the way things operated before? And if I could lead the witness for a second. The retail focus on e-commerce and the higher costs that are contained in that strategy of e-commerce is a new strategy. Can you benefit in that e-commerce either, because the retailers are also looking to offset that with a lower cost rail option? Or can you somehow play a role in the e-commerce chain in a way that you didn\u2019t, that you didn\u2019t before? Jim Foote : Well, yes. there are two benefits \u2013 well, not call it benefits, I shouldn\u2019t use that word there. There are two opportunities for us that may arise as things evolve. First is, I think and this is just my own personal thoughts. I think that there will be more manufacturing that takes place in this country and any kind of business activity like that. It\u2019s good for the railroad. Secondly, we now can compete with a truck in the markets as they become more and more large quantity shippers that fit well into the rail dynamics, because of our service. So, with our service product that we had before and because of the disparate network the way product moved, it was difficult for the railroads to compete in e-commerce arena. I think that as we go forward, that will be a big opportunity for us. Walter Spracklin : Okay. I appreciate the time. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Jason Seidl from Cowen. Your line is open. Jason, your line is open. please admit yourself. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Hey, Jim and team, hope you guys are doing well. It seems like we\u2019re going to be coming out of this pandemic on a state-by-state basis. So, it\u2019s going to be a little bit choppy and disparate. What kind of challenges is that going to present to CSX and the network? Jim Foote : Probably, the same kind of challenges that we experienced in the past when I talked about a slow decline is harder to manage than a complete shut off. It was easier for us as to adjust as we described when the auto industry just completely shut down in a week. My guess is the auto industry won\u2019t completely start up in a week. And so we will be challenged as the traditional logistics chain is not the same. And so we\u2019ll have to \u2013 we\u2019ll have to evolve, we\u2019ll have to work with our customers and it will present more of a challenge for us. I don\u2019t see the fact that one state might come back online in certain areas two weeks before somebody else does. Texas starting out before Pennsylvania is not that big of a deal. It\u2019s the industry that will start up across the country based on the comfort level of the population as the States come back. Jason Seidl : Yes. that makes sense. And is this where sort of that flexibility with your headcount is going to really come into play and help you out? Jim Foote : Yes. that\u2019s why, again, we\u2019re trying to anticipate you may be heard a lot of people talking about planning, modeling, thinking, what do we do, new norms, et cetera, listen, we spent \u2013 have spent and continue to spend a lot of times brainstorming about what could happen and how are we going to be in a position to respond. Jason Seidl : Sounds good. Listen, everyone, be safe out there. Jim Foote : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Jim, in your closing comments, you mentioned some of the prior periods of destruction that you\u2019ve been through and obviously, each one\u2019s different. But you\u2019re former employer, you, Jamie and Mark, all arguably had the best performance both operationally and financially during probably the closest thing to what we\u2019re dealing with now in 2008 or 2009. What are some of the similarities that you see to this environment back to 2008 or 2009, and some lessons that you can bring from that period that\u2019ll help you out to proactively to get the system right-sized get still without disrupting the service? Jim Foote : Well, I think 2008-2009 again, we saw not this sudden shutdown, but we saw clearly, a dramatic and shutdown. And as a result, we looked back to those days to see \u2013 yes, because I wasn\u2019t at CSX and pretty much none of us were here to see what the traffic declines were, what the traffic pattern declines were. And it was helpful for us to try and to understand what it\u2019s like when 20% of your business goes away in two weeks. So, lessons learned from all of those things, I hate to age myself, but yes, I\u2019ve been through just about every modern day a financial calamity plus, like I said, all those in my career, but this one is clearly the most challenging. Jon Chappell : Are you implementing similar operational thing that you did north of the border 12 years ago? Or is it a completely different response given the network and like geographic exposure? Jim Foote : No, it\u2019s again, there\u2019s no magic to the geography, there\u2019s magic to people. And the mindset of the people here in terms of making decisions, being quick, being nimble and getting things done all while looking forward and not getting a tunnel vision is the same. We have a phenomenal team that recognizes what needs to get done and we work together and we execute. Just the way we did it before. I mean, that was, it was just good people there too. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities. Please go ahead. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good afternoon. So clearly, we\u2019re in uncharted territory here and you\u2019ve talked a lot about how you\u2019re staying close to your customers, but I wonder if you could just talk a bit about how you\u2019re collaborating with your interchange partners to prepare for various downturn and recovery scenarios? Jim Foote : Well, you know, it\u2019s a network business. What happens to one of us happens to all of us. It wasn\u2019t that just the auto plant shutdown on CSX; they shut down across the country. We work together on a constant basis managing the fleet as it moves across the network, open lines of communication, good coordination, making sure that we don\u2019t get the a lot of equipment is stuck in one terminal that could begin to slow down the network. And I think over the last couple of years, you\u2019ve heard that many of us say most of the operating people now at the various railroad all think alike. We\u2019re all kind of working off the same page in terms of moving assets and running the network to the maximum level of efficiency and that\u2019s been extremely helpful, the coordination and understanding has been extremely helpful. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thank you. That\u2019s my one. Jim Foote : All right. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thanks, Jim or Kevin, if I can just follow-up in the last response, obviously, completely understandable that you pull your guidance given the variety of kind of the spread of uncertainty out there. But I\u2019m sure you guys have planned for multiple scenarios that can play out in the next two or three quarters. So, can you share kind of some of the, like the bull-bear base case scenario open of what volumes look like and 2Q, 3Q, 4Q, kind of as part of our planning samples? Jim Foote : Well, yes, we\u2019ve certainly \u2013 we\u2019ve certainly looked at all of the alphabets the V, the U, the L, and what I use that W as possible recovery scenarios. And obviously, the volumes in each one of those numbers is significantly different. So, as a result, because there is such a huge difference between that, that\u2019s why at this point in time, maybe, give me another 30 days, we\u2019ll have a better vision as to what the real startup plan for the auto is, what\u2019s going on with steel, what\u2019s going on with X, Y, and Z. Other than that, it\u2019s just a hypothetical exercise and that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t want to try to guess at this point in time. And so I apologize, but we\u2019re just not going to give you some kind of numbers like that. Ravi Shanker : Okay. Thanks. Jim Foote : Yes, Ravi. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Slater, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. Bill Slater : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Kevin Boone, Chief Financial Officer; and Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim Foote : Thanks, Bill, and thank you to everyone for joining our call this afternoon. Wow where do I start talking about this quarter. This was the most disrupted quarter I have experienced in my career with both the fastest decline in volumes followed by one of the most rapid increase in volumes in the company's history. Reacting to those extreme swings while dealing with the pandemic has been and continues to be challenging. CSX employees have been absolutely amazing in their response and I want to thank them for the hard work and dedication to keep the rail road running well. And I would be remiss if I didn't extend special recognition to our employees and their families who have fallen ill from the virus. Our thoughts are with them. In difficult times strong companies adapt and that's exactly what we have done. Despite all that has been accomplished to date and CSX's transformation we are still finding opportunities to be better, faster and more reliable. The actions taken over the past months will not only make CSX more efficient but more importantly they will allow us to be better delivering service to our customers in the future. Turning to the presentation, on slide 5 is an overview of our financial results which Kevin will discuss later. Due to the economic impact of the pandemic second quarter EPS declined 40% to $0.65 while the operating ratio increased to 63.3%. On slide 6 you could see that all business lines were negatively affected by the pandemic. Second quarter revenue declined by 26% year-over-year on 20% lower volumes. Sequentially the volume decline was the largest in CSX's history and almost twice as severe as any quarter during the 2009 recession. Merchandise revenue and volume declined 22% with the largest headwind coming from the automotive plant shutdowns. Automotive volumes declined 71% in the quarter including six consecutive weeks where volumes were down more than 90% each week. Intermodal revenue declined 18% on 11% lower volumes as both the international and domestic businesses were impacted by lower consumer and industrial demand. Coal revenue decreased 48% on 44% lower volumes. Both the domestic and export markets were negatively impacted by weak demand, from the combination of reduced power consumption, low natural gas prices and export benchmark prices. Other revenue declined 19 % due to lower affiliate revenue and declines in demerged charges and intermodal storage revenues. Turning to slide 7. Safety remains my top priority. Even though we had an all-time low number of train accidents in the quarter, the frequency rates for both train accidents and personal injuries increased due to the lower level of volumes. While CSX continues to lead the industry year-to-date in safety we must do better. We will never be satisfied with our performance if any of our employees get injured while at work and we are undertaking a comprehensive safety engagement initiative this quarter focused on strengthening critical rules compliance and systemically identifying and eliminating unsafe acts. Moving to slide 8, let's review our operating performance for the quarter. Despite the challenging operating environment the railroad continued to run at a high level. The operating team successfully implemented significant plan changes while maintaining fluidity and driving efficiencies across the railroad. In addition to these service design changes we also drove increased yard productivity setting a new record for cars handled per hour worked. Additionally, CSX continues to lead the U.S. class 1 railroads in fuel efficiency setting a new quarterly operating record of 0.96 gallons of fuel per thousand gross ton miles. Fuel efficiency along with ESG more broadly are priorities for our team. We are focused on leveraging the inherent benefits railroads have as the most sustainable mode of land-based transportation and are working hard to make sure CSX is building on these benefits to continue leading the industry in safety and sustainability. The topics of ESG and driving positive social impact are critically important to CSX, our customers and the communities we serve and we look forward to providing additional detail and key initiatives in our sustainability report to be released later this month. Slide 9 clearly highlights the unique operating challenges faced during the quarter. As volumes dropped more than 25% and then bounced back nearly 20% since Memorial Day. The team acted decisively to adjust the network for the changing volumes reducing total train starts roughly in line with volume declines and realizing line of road efficiencies even greater than the volume declines. These results reflect the strength of our operating model and the ingenuity of our team. In addition to consolidating trains across the network, they found new opportunities to integrate auto and unit trained business into the merchandise and intermodal networks as well as other unique service changes to be more efficiently leverage yard and local operations. When volumes began to recover late in the quarter we started recalling employees and added train starts to meet demand but we are confident that many of the changes we made during this period are durable and make CSX a stronger company. Slide 10 shows our hourly trip plan performance in the quarter. Car load trip plan performance of 80.5 was consistent with first quarter results and intermodal performance remained high at 94%. Volume has been volatile but we are working closely with our customers to ensure they are appropriately resourced and prepared to handle incremental volume when it comes. I will now turn over to Kevin for more detail on the quarter. Kevin Boone : Thank you Jim and good afternoon everyone. The second quarter of 2020 represented the most significant revenue drop in the company's history. [indiscernible] with an $800 million revenue decline our company clearly responded. From a cost perspective our focus through this period was to accelerate initiatives that will deliver sustainable, structural cost reductions that position us to leverage growth as the economy recovers. As a leadership team we were deliberate in our strategy, focused on avoiding the pitfalls of making short-term cost decisions to the detriment of growing the business profitably as the economy rebounds from the pandemic. As you can see on slide 12 total expense was down 19% in the face of a 20% decline in volume. This includes the impact of approximately 60 million of unique headwinds we faced in the quarter which included lower real estate gains, severance costs related to a management restructuring, specific COVID-19 related costs, higher depreciation and property tax as well as equipment impairments in the quarter. Excluding these items costs would have been down 22% year-over-year. I frequently get asked a question especially over the last three months how much of your cost base is fixed versus variable and naturally everyone wants to hear how variable it is when volumes are declining and how fixed it is when volumes are on the rise. The reality is very little of our expense just falls out with lower volume. Action and a lot of hard work is required. It's a balance to ensure we variabilize the cost structure while maintaining service levels. In the second quarter we successfully identified creative solutions to help drive efficiency on a long-term basis. Some of these efforts will show up near term while others will benefit us in the quarters ahead. As volumes improve off the bottom I am confident you will see very strong operating leverage driven in part by a lot of the hard work and effort the team has put in over the last several months. Walking down the expense line items, Labor and fringe was 22 % lower reflecting the benefit of reduced crew starts, lower operating support costs and reduced labor at our terminals as well as dramatically lower overtime spending. Crew starts were down 24% exceeding volume declines in the quarter and saving over $70 million in total T&E labor expense. Additionally, the active locomotive count was down 25% year-over-year in the quarter, the smaller fleet combined with fewer cars online and freight car repair efficiencies helped drive a 20% reduction in the mechanical workforce while at the same time reducing mechanical overtime expense by 56%. We continue to remain extremely focused on overtime. The workforce efficiency and management execution we reduced over time across all operating departments by 50% versus the prior year driving $20 million of overtime savings in the second quarter alone. We also achieved significant largely sustainable reductions in our engineering contract labor expense and our intermodal terminal workforce. In addition to these efficiency improvements we had $39 million of lower incentive compensation expense in the quarter primarily reflecting lower projected payouts on existing plans. Finally, the quarter included $10 million of severance costs resulting from a management restructuring to align our resources and improve efficiency. From these actions we expect $25 million in ongoing annualized savings. As I've described before MS&O expense tends to be less volume variable than labor but we still reduce this line item by 9% in the second quarter or 14% when you adjust for the impact of $26 million and lower real estate and line sales gains versus last year. Continued improvement to the train plan combined with increased network fluidity enabled a 37% reduction in crew travel and repositioning expenses versus the prior year. On the mechanical side the active locomotive count was down 25% year-over-year. We closed the quarter with over 1,000 locomotives and storage. In addition, newer cars online and freight car repair efficiencies helped drive a 20% reduction in car material expense in the quarter. The safety of our employees remains CSX's number one priority. In the quarter we spend approximately $10 million in COVID related supplies to ensure our employees were safe and following CDC guidelines while they kept the railroad running. We leverage our purchasing power to procure large quantities of safety supplies to stage around the network. Going forward we expect a run rate of $1 million to $2 million per quarter for the balance of the pandemic. I already mentioned the decline in the real estate gains in the second quarter. For modeling purposes our current assumption is for minimal sales activity across the balance of the year. We continue to see sales opportunities longer term while the team is also focused on accelerating strategies that will increase recurring income streams that are tied to our real estate portfolio. Fuel expense improved $143 million or 61% year-over-year driven by a 50% decrease in the per gallon price, lower volume and significant efficiency improvements. I probably sound like a broken record but we achieved another all-time record quarterly fuel efficiency at 0.96 gallons per GTM. Looking at other expenses. Depreciation increased $7 million or 2% in the quarter mainly driven by our 2019 equipment study. Equipment rents expense decreased $14 million or 15%. Lower volumes as well as improved cycle times and our intermodal market was the most significant driver. Turning below the line. Interest expense increased primarily due to higher debt balances partially offset by a lower weighted average coupon. Income tax expense decreased $123 million or 45% primarily resulting from lower pre-tax income. Absent unique items, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5% for future quarters. Closing out the P&L, CSX's operating income decline 37% year-over-year with a 63.3% operating ratio. Turning to the cash side of the equation on slide 13. On a year-to-date basis capital investment is roughly flat. We continue to invest in our core track, bridge and signal infrastructure prioritizing investments that provide safe and reliable train operations. We are not cutting capital especially investments in the safety of our core infrastructure and projects that produce attractive returns. Through the second quarter free cash flow before dividends was $1.4 billion down 15% versus prior year. Free cash flow has continued to be a key focus for this team. Even in this challenging environment we saw free cash flow conversion on net income exceeded 100%. Our results this quarter really highlight the significant improvement in our operating model. Our ability to generate positive through cycle cash flow allows us to continue invest in our network and pursue incremental investments that will further strengthen our business. Importantly, our cash and short-term investment balance at the end of the second quarter was $2.6 billion. This industry-leading cash and liquidity position provides us ample flexibility going forward and we remain committed to distributing excess cash to shareholders. With that let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Foote : Thanks a lot Kevin. Concluding on slide 15 we are we happy to see the volumes recover from the May trough as the economy strengthens. However, while these trends are encouraging the ultimate path of the recovery remains too wide to accurately predict at this point. As for CapEx we are still expecting the full year to be at the low end of our initial $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion range. We will never reduce or defer any spend that impacts safety and we will continue investing to maintain the integrity of our network. We are, however, evaluating our capital spending programs to maximize efficiency and prioritize high return projects. We're applying the same discipline approach to our capital budget that we do to our operating expenses and making sure every dollar is spent productively while actively seeking out and eliminating wasteful spending. It's this mentality that has generated CSX's industry-leading cash flow profile and strong liquidity position. Not only does our transform cash flow profile provide additional operating flexibility during these periods of uncertainty but it allows us to continue investing for the health and growth of the business throughout the cycle. CSX is a better company today due to the actions taken over the past few months. No matter what path the recovery takes from here we will remain laser-focused on serving our customers and making this company stronger than it has ever been. I'm proud to work with such an exceptional team of railroaders and I'm more confident than ever that the best is yet to come for CSX. Thank you and I'll kick it back to Bill. Bill Slater : Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time I would ask everyone to please limit themselves to only one question. With that we will now open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Good afternoon. I wanted to see if you could offer some more thoughts on the structural changes to cost and how we might think of those? I guess the simple framework I think of is just kind of the schedule and what would your train schedule look like if the volumes came back to pre-COVID levels. I don't know if that's the right framework or if there are other things, just want to see if you can give more of a framework of the structural cost take out and how that looks when volume comes back. Thank you. Jim Foote : So Tom, I think probably Jamie is -- probably the best, can give us a little bit of the color behind everything he's been working on so hard for the last three months. Jamie Boychuk : I know absolutely. Thank you for the question Tom. As Jim mentioned and both Kevin we've seen a bit of a rebound obviously on our volume levels here over the past six weeks. We have being up 25% from our low point during the COVID period here and if you take a good look at that this business has come back with us only using 15% more locomotives and 14% more [real estate]. So we have, we use this time during COVID almost like our practice hour to be prepared on how to run trains differently, on how to really adjust our network. We're using more distributed power as Jim had mentioned in his opening. We are doing more of a train mix. Our auto network which practically disappeared throughout the COVID period has come back strong and we are moving it in a different way than we ever have. We are mixing the auto network with our manifest and in some areas with our intermodal network and reducing those train starts, road starts that we see out there is going to be a good lasting effect as we move forward. Are we going to have to continue to add some assets? Absolutely. It continues to improve and go above the pre-COVID volume. Definitely we'll be putting some assets back in and bringing some more people off furlough but I've always said that every asset we bring back in we'll learn it to keep and we're running the network we're starting to get our mojo back I guess with respect to our main line speeds where we hit 21 mile an hour here today which is a number that we're happy with. So we want to get that fluidity moving. And also in our yards we sees that won't come back. We have made sure that we've reduced the proper shifts in some of our diesel shops as well as move to work some of our Q type work which is some of our heavier semi-yearly work to certain facilities. It's working really well. We'll continue to do that which will continue to help us drive those savings and particularly on some of the areas of engineering. So if we take a look at not just this being the costs on the transportation side it's very successful in making sure that we get good work blocks out there. Our engineering team even though we're putting in still the same amount of ties and rail as we did last year we're doing it with $17,000 less per mile and we\u2019re doing it over $3 less per tie installed. So these are items that we're going to continue to move forward even as the volume continues to get back to pre-COVID levels and we feel quite confident that we're going to be able to absorb some of the cost or some of the volumes as it continues to come back. Tom Wadewitz : Great, thank you. Jim Foote : Thanks Jamie. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ken Hoexter : Hey, great. Good afternoon. Jim, can you maybe talk about given the speed of the volume rebound that you're seeing and carloads now down only mid single digits. Thoughts on employees may be little bit more details on what you did with the restructuring there did you eliminate layers where there shift in operations and maybe the pace of return of some of those employees and then I guess in a bigger picture you're just thoughts on returning to possible operating ratio improvement as we get into the back half of the year. Thanks. Jim Foote : That's a nice three question one question. I like your style. Yes. Again in terms of the structural changes that we made during the last couple of months here, I test the team with taking a look at everything that we do and seeing if there is a better way to do it. It wasn't just a exercise headcount reductions but it was an opportunity to see if during this more difficult period of time we could assess organization and figure out how we could eliminate layers and get things done more effectively and as a result of that we basically aligned in the areas where there probably should have been a long time ago and the organization is stronger and better performing as a result of that. Jamie, can offer a jump in little bit here more on calling back people -- more people in the field as we move forward. Our number one priority here is to make sure we deliver an excellent product to our customers. It would be when we saw that the dramatic yo-yo effect of our volumes over that six-week period there where everything just dropped off and then bounced back it's not an easy way to run a railroad and you've got all kinds of work rules etc. associated with how long it takes people to come back to work and so we're just now as Jamie said getting the railroad back up running with great fluidity and velocity. And now we will focus on getting back to what this team is now known for being exceptional operators and as we move forward in terms of the third part of your one part question the operating ratio is, it's an equation and we need to get the revenue stream back to where we expected it to be and we think based upon sequential increase week after week after week in the carload volumes which you see just like we do. Things are beginning, things are grinding their way forward and we hope that that continues and if that continues then we'll get back to where we think we should be which is showing everybody that we can run a railroad as efficiently and as lean as anyone else in North America. Jamie do you want to just, anything else that I missed? Jamie Boychuk : Yes. Just look at it when it comes to the headcount we make sure we have enough people. The most important part of that recipe really is working with Mark and his team ensuring that any customers who we get a heads up on who are starting to pick up on some of the traffic flow that we've got people where we need them and we start positioning people ahead of time as much as we can and we've brought in hundreds of T&E employees back. They're out there working for us on the front line moving the freight making sure that our customers get the service that they expect out of CSX but of course it's not easy as Jim mentioned in six weeks to go from your all-time low during this COVID period to a 25% volume increase and be able to pick it up is everything we said that we were going to be able to do at CSX and we've been able to accomplish that. So as more business at some point comes along again we work really, really close with our marketing team and we have got a good number of employees still on furlough that we want to find work for them and we'll continue to bring them back as we see the business level start to come. Ken Hoexter : Great two-part thank you. So thanks for your time and thoughts. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Hey good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question. I guess Jim or Mark can you give us some color on where you see the recovery coming right now? I think from our outside perspective it seems like a lot of consumer oriented freight markets are maybe rebounding a bit faster. Could you talk about that and maybe the dichotomy of what we're seeing on more core industrial trends or maybe that's not the right way to describe it right now. Mark Wallace : Sure. So it's Mark. So thanks for the question Brandon. So interestingly over the course the last few months as our employees have been working from home and not spending time in airports and hotels and out there meeting with their accounts, we made it a key priority for our sales and marketing teams to remain close to our customers in order to sort of understand what they're seeing in the marketplace and how we could continue to service their needs and I think the general consensus throughout the quarter from customers has been that the outlook remains unclear. Having said that I think as Jim said earlier we and our customers are certainly have been pleased and encouraged to see the volumes recover off the trough from May but I still think it's too early to say that we have an accurate view on the trajectory of the volumes or the shape of the recovery in the second half. Now getting to your question I think in merchandise obviously encouraged to see auto plants reopen which has helped other markets like steel and plastics and auto parts for example interestingly even our [Oregon food] business during the quarter which traditionally is a pretty stable business in a recession was impacted given the declines in ethanol as nobody was driving into the office every day. Our beverage business was impacted given some of the shutdowns in Mexico and those supply chains were impacted and our feed grain shipments were low given also some food processors were running low capacity levels. All these markets now are starting to see some good volumes across the merchandise portfolio and we'll obviously continue to watch them very-very closely. I'll just also touch a little bit on intermodal. In April and May, they were obviously tough months for us both for domestic and international but we started to see volumes rebound nicely in June especially on the domestic side as the economy began to reopen and we saw inventories being replenished, some of the retailers and we also saw strong volume surges for our e-commerce business as individuals stayed home but shopped online. So that was encouraging. We think that strength will continue and we're encouraged with the international businesses as previously announced some of the blanks sailings have been reversed but there are customers direct quote from them they remain cautiously optimistic for the back half of the year. And then just rounding out the portfolio with coal, the outlook remains challenge both for domestic utility and for export. So as Jim said earlier, Brandon, virtually every one of our markets and customers were impacted by the pandemic. There remains a lot of uncertainty around the pace of the recovery and the continuing impact of COVID-19 on states and businesses, coupled that with what's going on with the upcoming election in November and other geopolitical issues that all shapes our view that while we're encouraged with the increases that we're seeing today we remain cautiously optimistic about the back half. Brandon Oglenski : Appreciate thorough response. Operator : Your next question comes from Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good afternoon. So just given that the wild swings in volumes, are you guys seeing any challenges or choke points as the traffic comes back whether your own network or with any of the interchange partners? It just seems like the service metrics have deteriorated across the industry recently. So just curious what you're seeing from a fluidity standpoint and if you think some of those clients we've seen recently are just temporary blips? Jim Foote : Allison, it's Jim. I think I can't speak for the other industries but I can our experiences as like somewhat alluded to in my earlier answer, when we have that kind of really quick drop in and had to respond appropriately by reducing our workforce normally in a more traditional economic downturn scenario don't expect your employees they have to come back to work or don't expect them to come back to work so quickly. And in the normal scenario you're always worried, well Jesus these guys are all for 6, 8, 9, 12 months, are they going to be available for me to come back to work when the economy rebounds and I need to start recalling employees. So that was our principal concern working our way through this kind of maze and difficult period of time as to what is really going on here and so that was our concern was where are these guys going to be 12 months from now and I need to get him back to come back to work. Well, as we've now seen we had this short period of time and in that circumstance meaning we called people back. They have quite a lengthy time to actually return to work. When we call them and say okay business is back surprise, surprise then you come back to work tomorrow and the guy goes well, I got a couple of weeks here before I really got to markup and return and then there's a process to the seniority system where displacements occur. So it's just a work in progress for us to ramp up and get the trains fully staffed, so we can get our velocity back to where it needs to be our on-time our originations and arrivals where they need to be and that's taken us a little while and yes it shows in the metrics but we think that we are in a pretty good place right now and again I can't speak for the other railroads but I would imagine they have the same practically identical labor agreements that we do. They kind of probably struggled through this as well. And I just think now that everything is kind of smoothing out, we didn't see any kind of major congestion points throughout the North America like we sometimes do. So I think everybody's working very, very closely and effectively. There is a certain like mindedness now in the operating structure of the North American railroad where everybody kind of thinks the same way and acts the same way and as we said in the past the scheduled railroading model as it is implicated across North America is a good thing for the industry because we all know how to move trains now more effectively and efficiently than we put in the past. Allison Landry : Okay. Thanks so much. I mean it basically sounds like the takeaway is that you think this is mostly transitory. Is that fair to say? Jim Foote : Yes. [indiscernible]I think we are in good shape right now. Allison Landry : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Hi, thanks. I had a very quick follow-up first Kevin you've been helpful in the past more recently in helping us think about OR in terms of a six handle etc. I wonder if you could do the same for the third quarter is another six handle kind of in the cars because of the volume declines or can we get back to the five handles given the revenue growth is much more, a decline is much more benign and then Jim you also talked about, I was hoping you could talk about the underlying growth initiatives that you guys have been working on pre-COVID. How they're tracking in terms of truck back to rail conversions? You obviously have a little bit more of a track record in terms of good trip plan compliance and truckload rates are taking up. So I was hoping you can give an update there as well. Thank you. Kevin Boone : Yes. Amit, this is Kevin. I'm not going to give out any handles today. I thought it was appropriate last quarter but given where we are today and we're not guiding, I'll probably defer on that one. I will say as the volume comes off the bottom you're going to see a lot of operating leverage in the model. I'm very, very confident across all the expensive line items. If you look at it on a expense per GTM say we're going to see improvement across every area there and look as the volume come, if they come back stronger than what we anticipate that'll continue to improve the ORs. So we see, we just did [indiscernible] in the first quarter if anything our cost structure we've improved at this last quarter. So we pretty feel very confident once the volumes returned that we'll be back where we were. Jim Foote : Yes and as in reference to your growth initiatives as Kevin just talked about as the volume of the business comes back and I just talked about the equation here being the operating rationale being revenues and expenses. It's only appropriate that we let Mark answer the question of how he plans to grow the business here in the next couple of weeks. Mark Wallace : Jim thanks. So Amit, I think the journey continues on all our marketing efforts that we started these little less than a year ago now it seems like a long time but we haven't been at it that long but our clearly first priority at CSX was to fix the service product by and large mission accomplished there. I think we got the best service product going into this pandemic in the industry and we're very pleased with that and so, it allowed us to really focus on growing this company and really looking at all the marketing initiatives that we just haven't done in the past and the team's been hit hard at work looking all those things, peeling back the onion with our customers books of businesses, looking at opportunities, looking at business that maybe once was on CSX that has lost that had gone away over the years business that traditionally never moved by rail and moved by other modes of transportation, reaching out to those customers and explaining to them the value of CSX. I think part of the big benefit to as we've been going through this pandemic is as we talked to different shippers we offer a very competitive truck like solution and we're cheaper than the truck by and large. So in a time when companies are looking to save money during this pandemic, we become with our service a very interesting service option for them. So they continue that journey we're only 9 months or 10 months into this and we're very-very pleased with the lot of the progress that has been made across the portfolio, everything from metal and forest products and aggregates and a whole bunch of commodities where we've seen a lot of truck conversions happening and that as I said that journey continues and the work continues but so far our marketing team has done an outstanding job identifying a lot of those opportunities and we've got a great sales team that are actually going out and converting them. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Thanks very much Mark. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Hey thanks. Afternoon guys. So I don't know if this is for Kevin or Mark on the yield. So Radford car was down 7%, I think yields [indiscernible] fuel were down about 5%. Can you give us a sense of the price verse mix component in the quarter? And then I know mix as a tough one to forecast but directionally does mixing more or less negative in third quarter out to second and any thoughts Mark on the [indiscernible] with the benchmark grades if that goes down any further and any sort of help on the yield side? Thank you. Mark Wallace : Lot of questions in one here today. Just kidding Scott. I'd be happy to answer those. I'm doing -- let me attack the pricing side comes to the heart of your question, I think and obviously this was a tough economic environment this past quarter but our pricing philosophy has not changed in terms of continuing to price the value of the service product which we think is really good. I was extremely happy in the quarter despite the tough environment that we were able to secure several significant longer-term deals with great pricing in the quarters. So the team is doing despite the environment the team is continuing to go out and get the price increases that we're looking for and I'm very-very pleased with the work they're doing. On the merchandise side, we saw positive pricing year-on-year. Inflationary plus pricing really good pricing area. Intermodal again increases year-on-year and then coal well, we can talk about that at another time but clearly a bit of a challenge especially when the export side and then on the domestic side as well. With respect to RPU Scott, I think the big story on RPU and the quarter was a fuel surcharge just given what happened with fuel in the quarter. If you look at our intermodal RPU was down 8%. If you exclude the impact of fuel surcharge that was about a 5% to 6% impact there. So we'd be down to 3% on intermodal for RPU and merchandise excluding the impact of fuel surcharge merchandise RPUs would actually be up. So a lot of mix issues as we've talked about. You and I and the rest of it everybody else always mix plays, ongoing impact in any given quarter just with the different RPUs and the different screens and the various commodity groups that we move. So we're always going to see that but clearly the big story this headline story this a quarter was the impact of fuel surcharge. So not going to give much guidance going forward but hopefully these things moderate here would hopefully that we will see a little bit less volatility on that side of the business going forward. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Chris Wetherbee : Hey thanks. Good afternoon. Kevin, you ran through I think a couple of cost that were it sounded a bit transitory from a second quarter perspective. I think severance costs around management restructuring which may actually go from I guess a negative in Q2 potentially a positive as we move forward. I think COVID steps down a little bit. Number one do you mind just kind of running through those again so we understand what sort of its some of the discrete moving parts are between 2Q and then 3Q maybe back half and then when your previous comment about sort of costs on a per GTM basis kind of improving sequentially as things volume comes off the bottom, would this be incremental to that? I just want to get a sense of maybe some of the magnitude there. I'm not sure it's a lot but I just want to make sure we understood it. Kevin Boone : Yes. I'll go through a little bit of it. So I called out the $60 million in total on a year-over-year basis. Part of that was the COVID supplies which I called out around $10 million this quarter. Quite frankly we did everything cost. We prioritized speed over cost to get these supplies out to the field and protect the employees. So we experienced some pretty high costs on that. That will be coming down. We think it's about $2 million going forward on a run rate basis which I said in my opening comments. On the severance side we said that was about $10 million with about $25 million annualized savings related to that. We had some equipment impairments within the quarter call it mid single digit on the equipment impairments and then obviously real estate gains on a year-over-year comparison basis was down significantly about $26 million so and then I also called out depreciation was up this year following late 2019 equipment study that we went through essentially making the depreciation up year-over-year which obviously has a lot of different components within it but doesn't necessarily reflect the lower capital base that we have today. In terms of going forward there's a lot of things that we've done and I spoke to this a little bit a lot of other initiatives that we're working on currently that will have that you'll probably start to see show up in the third and fourth quarters and quite frankly in the 2021 take a bit of time. When I think about leases, buying those out, getting out of leases that we worked with Jamie very closely to identify that we don't need any more. Those take a bit of time to get out of and see the savings. The procurement team has done an amazing job working on with our suppliers. We're fortunate enough to be in a position today where we have we're strong balance sheet. Suppliers want to work with us. That provides leverage we're working on cost savings that have a longer tail that can hopefully have a multi-year savings behind them. So those things will start to show up which I'm very excited about. But there's, we have probably over a list of 30 different areas which we're going through that are non-labor related that we think they're great opportunities. Vehicle spend, utilities we've done a great job on the fuel sourcing side. We think there's big opportunities there over the longer term. We've gotten really, really efficient. We're doing a great there but we can source our fuel a lot better too and Jamie and his team are really helping us there think creatively on that side and then I also mentioned the management labor that will obviously have some impact in the following quarters and in the next year. So we're pretty excited about those and now that we can get through the quarter we have we're all going to meet again next week and go through the list and hopefully it continues to grow. Chris Wetherbee : Great. Thanks very much for the color. Appreciate that. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Jamie just want to ask about train size and weights as it applies to CSX maybe the Eastern network in general. We're hearing a lot of that from western and Canadian peers. I mean could you provide some context as to how much they grew sequentially as volumes fell if that was one of the levers you could pull and are there any upper limits to what the network might be able to handle either from an investment perspective or perhaps a physical with great crossings and do you think that's really a difference or perhaps a constraint when you look at some of the peers operating with a lot bigger train size and weights during this pandemic? Jamie Boychuk : Yes Brian. We did see some good gains with both of our tonnage and length here in the past quarter hitting some records for ourselves pushing ourselves over 7% higher on our tonnage and around 4% on our length. We've only given a small piece of that back through the 25% of volume that we've seen. So we expect to see that continue forward and that is a, it is a big item that we talk about when we continue to design this network and we continue to look for those structural changes is that we'd like to continue to see our train length grow and depending on which quarter you're at, there's lots of opportunity on that end. So we're not going to give it all back. I can tell you that right now and we will continue to as I mentioned earlier with the auto network and how we were putting that together with our intermodal network and our merchandise network that gives us those opportunities to continue to grow our footage and our tonnage on our network and we have got a great network out there that has long sidings, that has double track, that is not an issue at all with respect to our network. We do have some grades in areas that may be more of a challenge in some areas but that's where distributed power comes in. And in some areas if we use a third locomotive instead of adding a train start and pushing a little more footage or tonnage we will continue to do that. Some other things, I guess to your second question somewhat, we have found some more opportunities on the network with respect to some quarters that we can do some small investments on which we are. I'd use an example of a trip that I was on a couple of weeks ago and Kevin joined me on that trip around the railroad. We found an area where we were back hauling cars millions of miles really back hauling automobiles that were coming off of St. Louis. I would have to go all the way up to Toledo to come down to Cincinnati because we had a subdivision in Indiana sub which was not cleared for autos. This past month our engineering team has done a fantastic job or I guess the past two weeks in clearing way for undercutting bridges and allowing the auto network to go direct now from St. Louis by Indianapolis down to Cincinnati again saving millions of auto route miles. So we continue to find those kind of opportunities out there. The more and more we get out on the network the more and more we work with the local people who are out there to ensure that we don't miss on these opportunities. Those are lasting structural changes that we will continue to see across our network. Brian Ossenbeck : All right. Great. Thanks Jamie. Operator : Your next question comes from David Ross from Stifel. David Ross : Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. I wanted to ask about the service levels in slide 10, both the trip plan performance and intermodal take down a little bit a little bit more on the intermodal side. Was there also a difference between that quarter average say on that 94% intermodal versus how it was the beginning of the quarter versus the end of the quarter? Is that 94 consistent or did it go from kind of a 96 to a 92 as you move through the quarter and volume came back and how does that relate to taking share back from truckload especially as rates are improving and the truckload side? Jamie Boychuk : Well, I'll take it on the first part and I'll pass it over to Mark to talk a little bit about customer side but on our trip planned side that exactly what happened is your example we're towards the growth when we started to see this large pickup on our business when we went to this 25% increase in volume in six weeks, we definitely saw a little bit of our deterioration I guess really in some of our trip lines across the board. We're in a much better situation now but it is a enormous task to turn this big ship in six weeks to absorb that kind of volume. Operating team I would say has done an amazing job Marcelo Estrada who runs our intermodal business has done a great job making sure that trains that did arrive late to some of our ramps were offloaded faster by utilizing some of the assets we had at that end but to your point some of those percentages have dropped and we're starting to see that rebound come back but definitely very-very large volume swing. Mark Wallace : Yes. I'd say just on the sort of truck conversions like there's good news bad news. Yes to Jamie's point we saw some of the quick time performance numbers fall below where I think we'd like to see them for intermodal and we were sort of 99% and again full visibility to our customers, we provided that last year in October. So they see exactly how we're performing to these trip plans. The depths of this crisis sort of in May volumes were down pretty substantially and so it wasn't too much of an issue and you're doing okay there so but as certainly as volumes have picked up since the trough in mid-May, the service levels have improved quite substantially and continue to prove every day. So as these volumes come back were our trip plan performance it's continuing to improve really nicely and so I think if you talk to our channel partners they would say that we were there for them even during the trough and we continue to be for them be there for them especially as these domestic volumes are rebounding and coming back. David Ross : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Long from Stephens. Justin Long : Thanks and good afternoon. So I was wondering if you could talk about your active locomotive count. I am sure that's something that fluctuated throughout the quarter just given the volatility that you mentioned in volume. So can you just give us a sense on how that progressed over the course of 2Q and how you're thinking about the active locomotive count in the back half of the year? And then also along those lines would love to get your latest thoughts on the locomotive overhauls that you plan to do this year and longer term. Jamie Boychuk : Yes. Absolutely. Look our locomotive fleet year-over-year Q2 was down over 650 locomotives. We have obviously brought back some of those locomotives. We were, we did hit some all-time lows down in the 1800 locomotives when we had a business decline that was pushing down towards 28%. Coming back to where we are now we're just into the above into the 2000s and we will continue to monitor that. We monitor it really daily when we look at a locomotive fleet. We have as Kevin mentioned over a thousand locomotives sitting in storage and we do have some locomotives that are ready to go in different areas. We position them properly. Now when we are very selective of what locomotives we put in storage. We made sure that we put down those that weren't, that were higher fuel burn that didn't give us the best performance and we tucked those really towards the back of the storage area as we continue to rebound and bring back some of the locomotives but that's where it's important that we continue to do a rebuild program. We believe in that rebuild program. We're finishing up what we committed to this year and next year as well, 30 plus locomotives that we're going to continue to rebuild into next year. I mean the fuel efficiency you get from those locomotives as well as the reliability. At CSX we found early on that we had a tired fleet and we needed to do something about it. We had well over 4,000 locomotives three years ago to where you see where our numbers are today and at CSX in the past we just continued to buy locomotives and just add them to the fleet and never retired anything. So we've taken the opportunity over the last three years to make sure we got the most efficient reliable locomotives out there and that's what we're pushing across the network now and particularly on the distributed power and that technology wasn't really utilized at CSX when we first got here and this team has done an unbelievable job wrapping arms around that and understanding the importance of that fleet and one last point with our locomotive fleet is we're very lucky that the majority of our fleet is AC locomotives which is more reliable. We've put down the majority of our DC locomotives. We did that a while ago and where we finished off changing out some of those to the AC fleet we had stored which allows us to pull more horsepower per locomotive and again that reliability. Justin Long : Great. Very helpful. I appreciate the time. Operator : Your next question comes from Jon Chappell from Evercore ISI. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Kevin, you mentioned the elevated cash balance and you've been able to add to that board without really adding significant stats. So you're still very net debt we are getting in a good position there. started buybacks in June it looks like which is probably earlier than you had anticipated the last time you spoke to us in April. Can you just give us some cadence around how we should think about capital return in the second half of the year? Is the third quarter going to be maybe look like a measured pace like June or could we see a return to the type of buyback pace of prior? Kevin Boone : Yes. I don't think we're sitting here thinking we're out of the woods yet. So I think the approach is going to continue to be very, very prudent. Jim and I talk about that a lot every week but also opportunistic at the same time. I mean clearly on a long-term, medium-term basis we don't need $2.6 billion of cash on our balance sheet. We need something well south of one billion to really run our business. So we have a lot of excess liquidity right now. Certainly makes me feel good at night to go to bed and have that cash balance just given all the uncertainty in the world today but we'll use it effectively over the next few quarters and talk closely with our board as well on the strategy around that. Jon Chappell : Okay. Thanks Kevin. Operator : Your next question comes from Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : Yes, hi guys. Hey one thing I'm curious about on the wage inflation or said another way your cost per employee which I believe was down pretty sharply in the second quarter. I know there's moving parts with employees furloughed employees coming back but essentially could give how we should think about that part of the equation going forward? Jamie Boychuk : Yes. Look there was a few moving parts to that in the second quarter. One when you look at our headcount number it included 300 on the reserve boards on average through the quarter and obviously the cost related to those employees is lower than what you would see on average and we no longer have those reserve boards when you look into the third quarter. So you'll see some normalization there. Also I highlighted the incentive comp and that will also have an impact in the quarter as well and would expect that to normalize a bit here. Sequentially when you look at the headcount probably something more flattish into the third quarter on average, same average that you saw in the second quarter that I would expect the overall per employee cost to go up slightly here particularly what the mid-year union wage increase as well. Jordan Alliger : Thanks very much. Operator : The next question comes from Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : Hey Mark much earlier in the call you spoke about your efforts to reconvert some freight that the carload business had loss over the years and that some freight, that has always moved on trucking hasn't moved in the railroad. As the trucking market seems to be moving to an inflationary pricing backdrop pretty quickly here, can you take a step back and let us think about where you are in the sales cycle and some of these efforts that may have been disrupted by COVID and its impact on your business and your customers business and it just really did you size this up as a needle moving opportunity for CSX and investors over say a two-year timeframe? Thank you. Mark Wallace : Yes. Thanks Bascome, listen I certainly hope so. I think as I said it's been this pause I would say has been sort of a refreshing time period for people from working at home to sort of step back and reevaluate things and where we are and what the priorities are and where we're focusing and look at opportunities opportunistically going forward and I think we are seeing the opportunity to look at a lot of those conversion opportunities and we know there's a huge market out there for us to protest to be able to go out and tap in and address that maybe just because for various reasons over the years CSX is ignored or just didn't want to move it or wasn't focused on those opportunities and I think as we are looking to grow and looking for opportunities with a better service product, a lower cost basis which opens up the opportunities for us to play in some markets that traditionally we couldn't before and to price them. I think maybe this is a sort of a defining moment here and we'll see. We are extremely excited by the opportunities going forward. Now you got to understand the environment we are in. We're in a very tough situation given the current economic environment with COVID-19 and the economy where it is but certainly regardless we're still seeing great opportunities and I think those opportunities will continue and when the economy does recover and industrial production does resume back at full strength and the consumer economy is back at full strength and businesses is roaring again, I think you will see those efforts pay off big-time. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good evening everyone. May be shifting gears and actually looking out a little bit. I don't know if you guys have paid much attention given everything going on but the Investment America Infrastructure bill that's kind of going through the house right now has a few kind of rail provisions in there. Some of which kind of it include things like mandating two-person crews and launching congressional investigations into kind of PSR and the impact of PSR or something. So just wanted to get kind of your thoughts on that if you spend any time with your folks in DC and then and maybe labor just your latest conversations on going to one-person crews and maybe kind of sizing the risk that if you do have some kind of political change in DC it could potentially kind of undo some of the gains you've seen on PSR over the years. Jim Foote : Well, as soon as how it's a Washington question I think it's appropriate that I say I'll have to answer the question in a politically correct manner because I don't want to tell you what I really think of it. Everything comes out with a wish-list that's put forward by a well-known people with agendas and I don't know that politically billions and billions of dollars of capital investment over years and years and years on how to run the railroad appropriately and safely is going to be undone with some political mandate but we're certainly not focused on that but again I have been around a long time and there is I'm sure somewhere in some state house somebody's drafting up a bill right now to put the firemen back on the diesel locomotive. So we're aware of the situation. We follow all these developments in Washington and elsewhere but it's just a part of doing business but it's not something that distracts us. Ravi Shanker : Makes sense Jim. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask a question on overtime. You referenced some substantial reductions there this quarter as you have in prior quarters. So was CSX pre-PSR organized in such a way that it was more reliant on overtime and what do you think the remaining opportunity is there and would you expect that to have a knock-on benefit on safety? Thanks. Jamie Boychuk : I think the overtime we've mentioned I think over the past couple of quarters how important it was for us to get it in control which we have and we've hit out some great numbers across the board and it's also an area where we're able to use to flex as well. So even though I know Kevin threw out some numbers which were some very good percentages that we were able to drop, there are some areas as the business started to come back as fast as it did. We're able to flex ourselves and utilize a little bit of that pent up over time if you want to say by bringing it down. So is there more opportunity? Yes, absolutely there is on our engineering end. I know Ricky Johnson is working really hard with his engineering team to continue to bring down the costs particularly with the amount of time that they're getting out on the railroad to ensure that we're bringing those numbers down. On the mechanical side we've done an unbelievable job which Kevin had mentioned with respect to where our overtime is at and yes we'll continue to drive down those numbers but ultimately we'd like to get those overtime numbers down. So then when there's the time where we need it for a small surge we're able to utilize those employees on overtime if we get into an area where we need to do some hiring, we're able to use that as a bit of a bridge for us to get to that point. Overtime and safety, I don't really there's really a lot of correlation for me on overtime and safety. Safety is as Jim had started out the opening is for forefront for us. The number one most important piece of railroading and how we start all of our discussions around the railroad and we will continue to be. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thank you for the time. Operator : Your next question comes from Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much, good afternoon everyone. I wanted to focus on a little bit of the structural change that's been precipitated here by COVID-19 and really focus on two elements and love to hear your commentary on both. First of all is whether your capital intensity is something you're relooking at or you are reexamining. Mark you talked about getting into new areas you haven't been in before but are you looking as well to getting out of areas where you have been and that have been insignificant and structural decline particularly in coal, could we see some line divestiture that would come about as a result of significant decline in coal and the second part of this structural change is how well you and the railroads have done both in the global financial crisis and now this one whether you reexamine your capital structure and whether additional leverage is something that you could contemplate going forward given the consistency that you've been able to provide from a financial perspective through some of these very difficult times. Jim Foote : Well, let me start maybe some of you guys want to jump in there with some brief comments. We're not in the, we don't have a railroad that's up for sale. We're very comfortable with our network. We are in the business right now of looking for business. We are open for business which [takes] every piece of business that we can get after. Our strategy is to grow this company. Maybe that wasn't the case when the cost structure was what it was before but based upon our levels of efficiency what we think we can do in the marketplace we're not interested in divesting and so our network is rock-solid. In terms of financial reengineering so to speak based upon what we've been through, I think for a company like CSX that has dramatically changed its financial profile and dramatically changed its cash flow, I think what was important to the rating agencies and others was to watch us work our way through various different in the economic scenarios and I don't think you could probably draw up a better stress test for a railroad to see how you're going to perform in difficult circumstances then what we were going through not only associated with the pandemic but what we've gone through before that with basically an industrial recession. So you take the industrial recession you throw in there the pandemic on top of that, you start figuring out what's going to transpire in the fall with the elections and all we do is keep kicking out cash day after day after day hour after hour. I think yes, that we have proven to the world that we had transformed this company into a very-very strong and stable financial company that and right now we have no obviously no reason to do that. Kevin just told that, we are having a hard time finding places to store the cash that if we decided that we wanted to level up further we've already said we've proven to the world that we have the capability in the world to do that. So I think it's a, I think again proof is in the pudding, people ask us what are you going to do two and a half years ago when we started on this adventure. This is what we told everybody we were going to do and now we again we've proven it. Walter Spracklin : Appreciate the color Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from David Vernon from Bernstein. David Vernon : Hey Jim or Kevin, I just wanted to hop on this issue of kind of [indiscernible] in relation to volume, it looks like and from the commentary earlier I sounded like we've just fallen below a watermark where it's too difficult to provide cost or it's happened too quickly. I'm trying to get a sense from what level of RTM do you think you need in the network to where profitability would be kind of stable on a year-over-year basis or is that not the right way to think about it? Kevin Boone : Profitability stable from an OR perspective on year-over-year basis? David Vernon : Just in terms of like an EBIT level. So volume was down 21% or so operating profit 35% or so and clearly it sounds like there was some deleveraging some volume. What I'm trying to get at is how much volume do you need to get back and does it matter if it comes back as coal or intermodal or merchandise is just RTMs like is it 45 billion RTMs like what's the magic number where you feel like that de-leveraging doesn't happen? Jim Foote : Yes, I mean I feel a lot better today where volumes are down mid-single digits versus the 20s that we're looking at. That's certainly helpful, so I think we're in a much better place right now and as I mentioned I think you're going to see some, you'll see across the board improvement on a cost per GTM level as we move in the third quarter assuming these volumes continue to recover from what we saw in the second quarter. So I'm very confident there and remind everyone it was just a quarter ago where we were traditionally what would be seasonally the worst quarter for us posted [58.7%] and I would I think we'd all agree here around the table today that all the things that we've done in the past three, four months have made us a better company and probably provided more leverage as the volume comes back. So I am more confident sitting here than I was when we reported in April that [58.7%] that we can really leverage it. It's just waiting on the economy to improve and going after it. So we've got a lot of initiatives that we'll continue to work on that'll hopefully continue to improve that. Kevin Boone : To answer your other question an RTM is not an RTM, it's not an RTM. I mean that's just basic railroading, yes, we had a lot more coal in the first quarter than we had in the second quarter. We'll probably and then we'll have in the third quarter. So they're not all the same. David Vernon : Yes. I guess the is that going to create a little bit of an added headline here a coal stays weaker than or like how should we be thinking about the mix impact of where kind of volume fell out of the network? Kevin Boone : It's only been going on at CSX for the last 10-15 years. So I mean, it shouldn't be a revelation that it's going to have an impact on the third quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Seidl from Cowen. Jason Seidl : Thank you operator. Hey good afternoon gentlemen. I wanted to talk a little bit about peak season and how we should start thinking about it and what types of conversations you've had with some of your partners out there and also taking into account that July seems like it's going to be a stronger month than June which is seasonally a little bit different than historical averages. So would love to hear some commentary around that. Jim Foote : Sure Jason. So typically we have really two peak seasons at CSX. We have sort of the labor day late, early September, late August peak season as you know kids are going back to school and we're seeing goods coming in from Asia and around the world, getting ready for all the fall activities. Halloween and Thanksgiving and all that kind of stuff and as people are going out and buying new goods for the back to school and all that kind of stuff so. I think clearly we've seen some good domestic intermodal volumes here over the last a couple of weeks as inventories have been replenished at some of the retailers. I think it's really wait and see if we see that sort of that bump up here call it around labor day. We'll see what happens with back to school. We'll see what if the states reopen, how the reopening process is, how the COVID cases are. So it's really in my view and our discussions with our customers are, we're cautious and we're watching it and it's I think you heard some of that from one of the channel partners who reported last week. It's a wait and see game. So we're there and we will be there and we'll have the crews and the locomotives and everything to be able to move that freight when if it does come and we'll see. So then the key, the other sort of traditional peak that we see is really around Thanksgiving or the e-commerce peak as people prepare for Christmas and order goods online. Again I think we'll probably see a peak, I think the peak may again depending on whether people are back at work, whether people are what the status of are the shopping malls open are people comfortable going to the shopping mall, if the COVID cases are still sort of concerning and people are cautious about venturing out then I think you may see that e-commerce type of peak a little bit sooner as people stay home and sort of order stuff on the web. So we'll see what happens but again as we said many times all this is really a wait and see period here for us as we move into the back half of the year. Jason Seidl : I think that e-commerce peak has been happening since almost April at least in the societal household for sure? Jim Foote : We have seen some good volumes on the e-commerce business. I mean clearly people are not venturing out and they're at home and they're ordering toilet paper and other things on the web. So our e-commerce peak and our volumes have been pretty strong in that area. Jason Seidl : Okay. Well, I'll keep our fingers crossed for the outlook for after labor day then. Gentlemen appreciate the time. Jim Foote : Absolutely. Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Hartford from Baird. Ben Hartford your line is open. Ben Hartford : Hey sorry about that. Thanks for getting me in here. Jamie, just wanted to get your quick take or clarify some comments made earlier about the safety performance. I think Jim had said that it was largely a function of lower volumes which makes sense in terms of the uptick in kind of the index whether it's personal injury rate or train accident rate but you're obviously undertaking some safety engagement initiatives as well, so what should we look at that as almost exclusively a function of lower volumes and so we're seeing incidences pop up on a per unit basis as a result of that or do you think that there was some slippage in safety performance on an absolute basis whether it was from service or some other factors that's leading to some of these initiatives that we're seeing in the third quarter. Jamie Boychuk : Really, I think what Jim was mentioning more than anything was these are ratios. So if I take a look at the incidents that occurred they are decreased. There's less injuries. There's less accidents but it's based off of a per mile and/or per hour work. So as we had 1,000 plus employees really almost 1,300-1,400 employees at one point furloughed those hours disappear. So it creates a bit of a headwind when you take a look at how we do our FRA ratios and on the injury side we were at 0.86 which is still top line in the industry versus a 0.81 in 2019 and on the accident side we were at 2.19 this year versus a 2.47. So we did see an improvement on the accident side. It's the injury hours that are different but I mean look at that that said heading into the future, I think every railroads has got a little bit of a headwind with respect to engineers who went on the ground to work as conductors because they have seniority flow back rights. So they're doing jobs that they weren't used to doing. Retraining was something that we weren't able to do in most circumstances because of social distancing. So we were doing the best we could to provide distance training and/or working with the employees to ensure that they're obviously were qualified they were just doing jobs that they hadn't done for a number of years. So I think that's a headwind that we'll probably see across the entire industry but absolutely this past quarter the man hours that were removed from the furloughs is what would have affected our ratio. Ben Hartford : Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Jamie Boychuk : All right. Well great. Thank you so much for spending your some time with us this afternoon and we look forward to seeing you all in the near future and be safe. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the CSX Corporation Q3 2020 earnings call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Slater, Head of Investor Relations for CSX Corporation. Bill Slater : Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Kevin Boone, Chief Financial Officer and Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations. On slide two is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on slide three. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim Foote : Thanks Bill and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. The last six months have truly been surreal. On last quarter's call, we discussed the largest and most rapid sequential volume declines in CSX's history. Now, just three months later, record sequential increases. Think about that. Volume declines and increases twice as steep as the largest moves we experienced in the great recession in a span of just a few months. Managing this historic volatility is incredibly difficult and I am extremely proud of the dedicated men and women of CSX as they continue to deliver against these challenges. Their hard work allowed us to efficiently absorb the record rebound in volumes while maintaining high level of service. This level of execution requires a commitment and coordination of the entire organization. Throughout this period, it has been inspiring to see CSX employees band together to reassess every aspect of the business and figure out where we can be even better. We are already seeing the benefits of these efforts in this quarter's results and will continue to do so in years to come. Now let's go to slide five for an overview of our financial results. Second quarter EPS declined 11% to $0.96 and our operating ratio of 56.9% remained in line with last year's record results. Maintaining this record efficiency level despite the combined headwinds from the pandemic, significantly weaker coal markets and approximately 250 basis points of unfavorable margin impact from lower real estate gains is truly impressive. Moving to slide six. Third quarter revenue declined 11% on 3% lower volumes, due primarily to reduced industrial activity as a result of the pandemic. Merchandise revenue declined 7% on 5% lower volumes with all end markets experiencing volume declines. Intermodal revenue was flat on 7% higher volumes as growth in both domestic and international volumes from inventory restocking and a tightening truck market were mostly offset by declines in fuel surcharge revenues. Coal revenue decreased 36% on 27% lower volumes as the coal business continues to be negatively impacted by reduced electrical demand, lower industrial production and lower global benchmark prices. Other revenue was down 12% due to lower affiliate revenue and declines in demurrage charges. Turning to slide seven. We cannot achieve any of our long term goals without first operating safely. In the third quarter, we realized new quarterly record lows for both train accidents and personal injuries as well as a new quarterly record for low personal injury frequency rate. While CSX continues to lead the industry in safety metrics, we can never be satisfied if even one of our employees gets injured while at work. The team is working to be even better by identifying and eliminating unsafe practices and conditions across the railroad. We continue to increase employee training and engagement with the goal of improving critical rules compliance. Turning to slide eight. Our safety focus is part of CSX's broader commitment to ESG and driving positive social impact. Rail is the most sustainable mode of land transportation and we are working hard every day to further these inherent benefits and ensure CSX is the most sustainable railroad. We made great strides in reducing our emissions and fuels consumption, including setting another fuel efficiency record this quarter by consuming only 0.93 gallons of fuel per 1,000 gross ton miles. And we have also set ambitious new long term emissions targets to continue this positive momentum. Earlier this year, we were the first U.S. Class I railroad to have an emissions reduction target approved by the Science-Based Target Initiative, setting a goal of reducing emissions intensity 37% by 2030. In addition to improving our emissions profile, we are focused on helping our customers meet their own emissions reduction targets. Not only does every shipment on CSX consume 20% less fuel than it did a few years ago, but our best-in-class service product uniquely positions CSX to help customers further reduce emissions by converting freight off the highway and onto CSX without sacrificing the reliability of their supply chain. We are honored by the recognition received today, including recently being named one of the Top 20 Most Sustainably Managed Companies in the World by the Wall Street Journal, but continuously push ourselves to be even better for our employees, our customers and the communities we serve. On slide nine, let's review our operating performance. Despite the challenges presented by record volume increases, the railroad continues to run at a high-level. Planned changes enacted in the second quarter drove strong productivity gains across the system. We further balanced the network and set a new quarterly record of 93 distributed power trains per day, averaging over 100 distributed power trains per day for the last two months of the quarter. Yard productivity also improved by blocking cars further upstream, reducing touches in the yards and finding new ways to be more dynamically share work between yard and local trains. Slide 10, these productivity gains are further highlighted, which compares current volume and asset levels against the pre-COVID levels from March 1. In total, volumes ended the third quarter above the pre-COVID levels, while asset counts were lower across the board. Looking at train starts, we are currently handling 3% more volumes with 11% fewer starts than we required on March. On a year-over-year basis, train starts were down 15% in the third quarter compared to a 3% lower volume. Additionally, since the May trough, we were growing volume twice as fast as we have increased the train starts required to serve this growth. No matter how you frame these results, the strong operating leverage highlights the durable nature of the changes made last quarter and is a testament to the team's success in taking advantage of the challenging volume environment to pull forward lasting efficiencies. I am sure you might have some questions for Jamie on this later in the call. Let's turn to slide 11 and our hourly trip plan performance. Carload trip plan performance of 73% and intermodal of 74% slightly trailed previous quarters due primarily to the timing lag at the beginning of the quarter when we began to step up to handle the surge in volumes. Trip plan performance improved throughout the quarter and we exited the third quarter near 80% trip plan performance level for carload and 90% level for intermodal. I will now hand it over to Kevin to review the financial results. Kevin Boone : Thank you Jim and good afternoon everyone. What a year it's been so far. Just three months ago, we were reviewing second quarter results, where we experienced record declines in customer business activity. We rapidly adapted and focused on driving efficiencies and structural changes that would serve us well as volumes returned. As you can see from our third quarter results, CSX was able to deliver, generating very strong operating leverage on a sequential volume increase of over 20%. As we sit here today, we are positioned for growth with a strong balance sheet and free cash flow profile. We also made the strategic decision to continue to invest in our infrastructure at levels exceeding plan. As we leverage these efficiencies, we took advantage of slow business activity. This will position us well to absorb future volume as growth returns. As you can see in the income statement, revenue was down 11% in the quarter. And volume growth at intermodal was offset by economic headwinds and merchandise combined with weak coal demand. While merchandise and coal markets remain challenged, revenues improved sequentially each month through the quarter. Partially offsetting the ongoing revenue headwinds, overall expense was down 11% on a 3% decline in volume. Walking down the expense line items, labor and fringe was 10% lower, reflecting significant efficiency improvements and lower volume-related costs. As Jim highlighted, we took the opportunity during this pandemic to make structural changes to the train plan. As a result, crew starts were down 15% year-over-year, compared to a 3% decline in volume. These improvements were made across the line of road, yard and local train plans. Fewer crew starts results in fewer active trains. The active locomotive count was down 14% year-over-year in the quarter. The smaller fleet combined with fewer cars online and fuel and freight and car repair efficiencies helped drive a 19% reduction in the mechanical workforce. You will recall, the overtime was a key cost lever for us in the second quarter. As volumes recover, we can flex back up using overtime where it makes sense, without adding headcount. Even with a small increase in overtime expense versus second quarter, we still reduced overtime year-over-year across all operating departments, by a total of 15%. We were also able to maintain significant reductions made in the second quarter through our engineering contract labor expense in our intermodal terminal workforce, even as volumes increased sequentially. You will note, the average headcount was roughly flat versus the second quarter, as the increase in the team headcount was offset by the impact of our management restructuring as well as the cycling of the emergency reserve boards from last quarter. MS&O expense decreased 7% in the third quarter, despite cycling some significant prior year impacts that nets to $40 million in headwinds. These include $65 million in real estate gains as well as non-railroad asset impairment. Adjusting for these impacts, MS&O would be down 15%. With fewer active locomotives and ongoing freight car repair efficiencies, locomotive support costs were down 24% and car material expense was 36% lower in the quarter. In addition, as volumes grow, we are absorbing it and driving efficiencies at our intermodal terminals with cost per container down over 25% year-over-year. We are focused on reducing cost across all areas, including optimization of utility contracts to reflect current consumption levels and increased use of efficient lighting, minimizing the use of external and contracted labor where possible and leveraging technology to reduce redundancies. These and other initiatives will continue to help control costs, as volume returns. Real estate gains were minimal in the third quarter and we continue to expect minimal sales activity in the fourth quarter. Looking beyond 2020, we continue to manage a pipeline of future properties that we will monetize when conditions are favorable. As I have mentioned before, I am also excited about additional opportunities to leverage our real estate and generate recurring revenue streams. Fuel expense was $104 million favorable, a 47% improvement year-over-year, driven by a 36% decrease in the per gallon price, lower volume, recycling of prior-year net expense related to non-recurring state fuel tax matters and record fuel efficiency. Ongoing fuel efficiency gains are enabled by a relentless focus on utilization of distributed power and energy management software, combined with train handling rules compliance. Looking at other expenses. Depreciation increased $10 million or 3% in the quarter. Equipment rents expense increased $3 million or 4% due to higher intermodal related equipment cost and inflation. Turning below the line. Interest expense was essentially flat. Its higher net debt balances were mostly offset by a lower weighted average coupon. Income tax expense decreased $37 million or 14%, primarily resulting from lower pre-tax income. Closing out the income statement, CSX delivered operating income of $1.1 billion, reflecting a 56.9% operating ratio. Turning to the cash side of the equation on slide 15. On a year-to-date basis, capital investment is roughly flat. We remain committed to investments that prioritize the safety and reliability of our core track, bridge and signal infrastructure. We use this opportunity to negotiate better materials and outside service costs, utilize track time to drive efficiencies and reinvestment savings into the network to take advantage of the lower train activity levels. We have spent a lot of time evaluating our non-infrastructure related capital and have made progress prioritizing high return projects, while also eliminating projects that are no longer needed long term. Capital allocation remains a focus as we identify and prioritize investments that will drive high returns in the future. Through the third quarter, free cash flow before dividends was $1.9 billion down 30% versus prior year, reflecting lower operating income, but also including impacts from lower proceeds from property dispositions. Free cash flow has continued to be a key focus for this team. Even amidst a challenging environment, free cash flow conversion on net income remains nearly 100%. Our cash and short term investment balance remained strong, ending the quarter at $2.9 billion. As I have referenced previously, I expect this balance to normalize below $1 billion over time. As you saw with our announcement today of another $5 billion share repurchase program, we remain committed to ongoing return of capital with flexibility to remain opportunistic. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Foote : Great. Thanks a lot, Kevin. Concluding on slide 16, we are continually assessing the pace of economic activity and we will respond to the prevailing environment by delivering customers the highest levels of service and reliability in the most efficient manner. We were encouraged by the speed at which volumes recovered from the trough, particularly the strength in the intermodal market. Fourth quarter volumes to-date are up year-over-year and we all hope for continued positive economic momentum. As for capital expenditures, we still expect to be at the low-end of our initial $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion range. This ability to confidently invest in our business throughout the cycle is a direct result of our industry leading free cash flow profile and is a testament to the work done to transform this company. We also remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders. We recently affirmed this commitment by expanding our recent purchase program by $5 billion bringing our total buyback authority to more than $6 billion. We entered into this pandemic period in a position of strength and confident that CSX would emerge a stronger company. I am proud to say that by staying true to our core values of operating safely, operating efficiently and helping our customers succeed by providing high level of service, we are a better company today. Thank you. And I will now turn you back Dollar Bill. Bill Slater : Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time, I would ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question. With that, we will now take questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Allison Landry : Thank you. Jim, so you talked about the trip plan compliance improving throughout the quarter and it sounds like it ended at least fairly close to where you were in the past few quarters. But what is the take from here to get those numbers up further? And then maybe, specifically if you could address on the carload side, where do you think you need to be ultimately to start to chip away at the opportunity to convert the merchandize volume from the highway? And then do you think this is something that could start to accrue in 2021? Or is this more of a 2022 and beyond story? Thank you. Jim Foote : Well, Allison, it's a perfect question. Let me just say and then I will turn it over to Jamie and Mark to follow-up, in terms of trip plan compliance. The surge of volumes was a challenge, but we are going to get back. Number one, we are going to get back to where we were and we are going to get back to where we were as quickly as we can. And then we are going to get better and we are going to get better and we are going to get better and we are going to get better. And Jamie can talk about some of the details associated with that. Jamie Boychuk : Absolutely. Look, as we continue to analyze the plan and we made our changes throughout the last few months, we wanted to make sure that everything we gained with respect to our train footage and train tonnage, road starts, that we didn't lose any momentum on that side. And as Jim had said, the traffic was really, at times it was all over the place and it was coming at different bubbles. We weren't sure exactly where it was going to end up. Working really close with Mark and his team, we were able to pull off some pretty amazing results, making some large reductions. If you take a look at just our train, year-over-year, our train length is up 13%, our train tonnage is up 12%. We are able to do that with like 350 less locomotives. So there's a lot of assets that we were able to pull out as we were making these changes and really, it's about exercising our people and getting them up to speed on running a network that's a little bit different than what we were used to, making that 18% reduction in road starts and longer trains, heavier trains. In some areas, some of the execution wasn't perfect, maybe what we were used to at the time. If I take a look at some of the areas, where we missed on our trip plans, it was only within a few hours. It wasn't like it was days. And really for us, service is all about reliability. So it's really important for us to get that reliability to the customer and we are working on it each and every day and we will continue to push that forward. And I will let Mark comment on the other. Mark Wallace : Yes. It's a great question, Allison. And everything Jamie and his team are doing to continue to deliver great service for our customers is really helping us win share in the marketplace with our customers. As we sit down and we open up their books and look for opportunities to gain share in lanes where maybe they haven't traditionally used our rails, they have been more truck focused or in some lanes in order for us to gain more of their wallet share, we are seeing a number of these wins even during Q2 and Q3. So as the service continues to get better and it will, we are going to find more of those opportunities. We are excited by them. We are growing a lot. We have seen a lot of good wins in forest products and metals and even in bulk markets like ag. We are seeing some great truck conversion wins. So the team is focused on it. We are identifying them. And thanks to the service product that Jamie and his team are delivering to us, that's making those opportunities easier with those conversations with our customers. Allison Landry : Thank you guys for the great color. Operator : Our next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brandon Oglenski : Hi. It's actually Brandon with Barclays, unless there has been a big M&A transaction on the bank side. But Jim, I just wanted to ask you, there is a narrative out there with a lot of investor focus at other railroads and with the sectors doing really well. But you guys have already gone through your PSR and if you look at your former employer, obviously some pretty big valuations north of the border. So I guess what do you want investors to measure against the next few years to hopefully regain some of that relative valuation premium to reflect your cash flow today? Jim Foote : Well, we don't measure ourselves necessarily against the other railroads. I guess if they thought we have already gone through, but that's only because we are so far ahead of them right now, all they see is our tail lights. And so yes, we are benchmarking against what we think are excellent operating companies out there and also looking at how we can continue to expand our services and help Mark out in any way he can possibly do to continue to grow our profile and grow our revenue base. And that's what this company has been about since the first day I got here. You can't really sell anything until you got a good product and we have created a fantastic and excellent product. And now we are going to continue to sell it. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you, Jim. Operator : Our next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. First of all, I am glad Brandon is still at Barclays. I got worried there for a second. Congrats guys, Jim, Kevin, Jamie and everybody on the strong operating results. I was hoping you could give us maybe some high level thoughts as we enter into 2021, specifically about the point at which you guys just have to add back costs more meaningfully given the recovery in revenue. It's obviously pretty amazing to see close to a 20% sequential increase in revenue and headcount be flat to down, MSO to be down pretty materially sequentially. If you can just talk about the runway on that type of performance in terms of the revenue versus cost performance and just how incremental margins can trend relative to the 80% that you guys achieved in the third quarter? Thank you. Kevin Boone : Hi. Amit, it's Kevin here. We are not going to get in to the 2021 guidance at this point. But, when we think about -- Amit Mehrotra : No. I am not asking for 2021 guidance. Kevin Boone : Yes. I got it. Amit Mehrotra : It's more like the mismatch. Okay. Yes. Go ahead. Kevin Boone : Yes. When we think about, to your point, incremental margins, clearly what we were able to do here in the third quarter versus second quarter shows the power, the leverage we have in the model. Certainly, if we see volume increase at a good pace next year, we will have to add some headcount. That will be a good new story. It won't be one for one. Maybe I will let Jamie talk to that a little bit, but we are preparing for that. We are preparing for growth around here. But we have done a lot of things structurally, when you look at our management workforce, you look at our G&A cost, that will certainly leverage in the next year. So a lot of work that we have accelerated next year that I would fully anticipate that we take advantage of going forward. The fortunate part is, through this pandemic we invested in our network. We have a lot of capacity. I think that actually differentiates us in the market today from what we have heard out there. So we have the ability to grow and grow at the volumes there. And so that's what we are all talking about right now as we look out to 2021, what that might look like? How do we resource for it? But still keeping an eye and capturing all the things that we have done over the last six to seven months and not losing those great efforts that we were able to achieve. Amit Mehrotra : So it sounds like -- yes, I am sorry. Jim Foote : As Kevin noted, I mean we have got a network that we can still bring on 20% to 30%. We are quite comfortable with continuing to bring on business, as we move forward. But I mean, look at the plan. The plan itself is running well. We continue to analyze it. We continue to execute and we will analyze and execute and continue to work very close with Mark's team with all new business opportunities that are out there. We have got a number of locomotives in storage that we can pull out. We are going to be doing some hiring. We have got some hiring classes out there with some T&E employees. And I think it's important that we stay ahead of what we see coming forward as well as working very close with our union groups and making sure that we are hand in hand with supplying the service that we said we would. And look, I have said it time and time again and I think we have proved it. We don't bring on assets unless they earn their keep and we sweat them. So that's what we are going to continue to do is to stick on the same model that we have been working towards. Amit Mehrotra : Is the comment on 20% to 30% volume growth, a capital, a CapEx comment in terms of not needing to add CapEx? Or is that also a comment about not needing to add a significant amount of OpEx to -- yes, go ahead? Kevin Boone : As I said, Amit, look on the CapEx side, we have got a great plant out there. We have got long sidings. We have got a double-track. We have got a good mainline. We have got good yards. So yes, absolutely, we can continue to absorb business on our mainline as Mark and his team brings it off. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good afternoon. And congrats on the really strong results. Great to see. Maybe I don't know, Jim or Mark, if you could just talk a little bit about pricing? What you are seeing in the marketplace? Obviously, your competitor is focused on and region focused on yielding up. Yet you still seem to be taking share. Maybe you could talk us through a little bit because obviously with down 8% on our revenue for car, it's tough to see on the mix impacts overall. You can talk a bit about what's going on in pricing and business wins? Mark Wallace : Hi Ken, hope you are doing well. So let's go back on the different markets. Merchandise RPU down 2%, fuel surcharge was a 3% headwind this quarter, to that intermodal RPU down 6%, fuel surcharge 4% and coal RPU down 12%, fuel surcharge was 3% headwind. The rest obviously, the delta there mix and price for coal most of that was due to price just given some of the export benchmarks that we saw and the softness in the domestic utility markets. Now, obviously mix continue to play an overall driver of RPU. This quarter like it always does, there was a negative mix overall. We saw that in metals and equipment and chemicals. There was positive mix in some like coal, export coal. We had favorability due to the thermal exports declining faster than the net exports. And minerals also saw some larger declines in shorter haul Northern aggregate business. That was just basically giving some of the budget cuts and some of the project cuts, because of COVID-19. So mix is always a bit of an issue for us, as you know. We are probably, Ken, going to see continued 7% to 8% gap between volume and revenue going forward into the Q4. I would expect that to sequentially improve into Q1 and beyond. Pricing, our pricing philosophy has not changed and price continues to be a main focus for the team as we deliver on sustainable and profitable growth. We are partnering with our customers to create solutions to help them grow and price to the value of the service product that Jim and his team are delivering. And I said it before and I will say it again, we are not sacrificing price for volume. Ken Hoexter : Wonderful. I appreciate the thoughts. Thanks Mark. Operator : Our next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is open. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Mark, I have got, I guess, a question for you or a question, if you will. How are you thinking about, I guess, you had kind of two different dynamic where the consumer and retail side has been super strong and trucking and intermodal tight and industrial has been kind of slower rebounding. What's your thought on industrial view? Are you optimistic that you are seeing signs of that picking up? And what is the customer seeing in the industrial side? Are they seeing a lot of tightness in truck that really encourages conversion to rail? Or are they not seeing such a tight market, given that the industrial side maybe hasn't improved like the retail and consumer side? Thank you. Mark Wallace : Yes. So it's a great question. And so we are seeing a tight, obviously it's a tight truck market out there. Things are, on the intermodal side, clearly there is capacity has been constrained, replenishments have been going on. There has been some driver shortages in several markets like Southern California, Chicago, et cetera. We have seen some good pick up in some truck conversions with our intermodal businesses, as Jim highlighted. Our intermodal trip plan performance has been quite good. Our service has been quite good. So we are happy with that and I think that will continue obviously. The consumer is still very, very strong. We expect a robust peak season around Thanksgiving time usually when we see that e-commerce peak to Christmas time. We expect that to be very strong. Actually, it has been strong through the pandemic. Just as people have been staying at home and ordering stuff online. But we expect it to pick up even more robustly going forward, as we approach Thanksgiving. So looking for that to continue through Christmas. And then overall intermodal, we are quite happy with the business and speaking with our customers, we expect that to continue deep into Q1. So good side there. I think on the merchandise side, on the industrial side, the tighter truck market obviously has allowed us to sit down with our customers and have different conversations. They are looking in these tight times now and their business levels are down to save some cost. Obviously transportation costs, for them, is a significant headwind. And so as we all know, the 12% to 15% discount that rail offers given with our good service product has allowed us to go and sit down with our customers and they can't get trucks. The truck market is tight. The spot rates are up. And so we are seeing conversions there. And we hope that continues and hopefully that traffic that comes to us remain sticky even post things do improve and the truck market eases up a little bit. If we are able to show the power of rail and keep performing like we know we can, hopefully a lot of that traffic will stick on CSX going forward. Tom Wadewitz : Great. Thank you. Operator The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Group : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So Kevin, on the MS&O costs, I know they are lumpy, but anything unusual or one-time-ish in this quarter? Any thoughts on how to think about MS&O in the fourth quarter, up or down? And then I was just wondering with the buyback, any thoughts on timing? Are you guys considering an ASR? And does this change your leverage targets in anyway? Thank you. Kevin Boone : Yes. Let's start with the MS&O. No, I wouldn't call anything extraordinary unusual in the third quarter. Usually what's unusual or what the analysts like yourselves like to call out with the real estate, which was almost de minimis in the quarter. So nothing there and obviously we had a year-over-year headwind, when you look at real estate gains. We had some significant gains last year and didn't have that this year. When we look to fourth quarter, we always have seasonality. This is around a number of areas in our business. When I look at engineering, the extra costs related to the winter, vacations start, the capital teams once they go on vacation, on to vacations, start to hit OE expense. We have G&A seasonality in the fourth quarter. So I would expect some year-over-year improvement in MS&O into the fourth quarter when you exclude the real estate from last year there. So we will see an uptick in MS&O sequentially, but still year-over-year improvement excluding the real estate gains from last year. What was the follow-up question? Scott Group : Just about the buyback and timing and leverage targets and all that. Kevin Boone : Yes. I think we are going to evaluate the buyback program. Jim and I talk closely. I think as we get more visibility, stability in the markets here, as we get more clarity around the pandemic and the implications there. Clearly $2.9 billion of cash is not what we need to operate our business. So I would expect that to trend down in the next year. So you could expect us to be back in the market. Scott Group : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Brian Ossenbeck : Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Kevin, one more for you. How are you viewing the opportunities in the land portfolio with gains pretty much minimal here for the rest of the year? And maybe if you can elaborate on some of those recurring revenue streams that you are evaluating? As you look at this book of business, are there more ways to grow in the future and convert traffic off the halfway with maybe leveraging some of that land for the industrial development projects? Kevin Boone : Absolutely. We are in great conversations. I actually just had the opportunity to hire a new head of our real estate group. I am very, very excited about what she is going to drive here at the company. She has hit the ground running here over the last few weeks. But she is working really closely with Mark's team on the industrial development side and identifying areas where we might be able to locate whether it's warehousing, other opportunities, whether it's us investing in those assets or partnering with others that know how to do it. So it's a great opportunity for us. In terms of the real estate sales, I mentioned it on my prepared remarks, we have a great pipeline. These things, we are going to sell when the time is right, when we can maximize value. But there is still a robust pipeline. It will probably be lumpy from here. But I am pretty excited about what we have in store over the next few years there. These things tend to take time to get to a close, but we are working pretty hard on that area. And then just on the recurring revenue side, it's something that I have asked the team to really focus on over the next six months. Whether it's electronic billboards, whether it's more fiber, anything we can do to leverage our real estate portfolio. These are great, great opportunities. And once you sign these contracts, they continue. You get revenue every year after year. So, it's really, we are one of the largest landowners in the Eastern United States. We should leverage that as much as we can. And so, I have challenged the team to go out and do that. And I think they are doing a good job so far. Brian Ossenbeck : All right. Thanks, Kevin. Appreciate the update on that. Operator : Next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Your line is open. Chris Wetherbee : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon guys. On slide 10, you have an interesting chart on operating leverage. And it really shows how much the resources have flattened out even as volume has continued to improve kind of coming out of August and into September and October. Conceptually, is there a point with volume growth that you feel like there will be a step function higher in some of these resources? Or can you continue to maintain, do you feel like you have capacity with the resources that are operating right now even as volumes are kind of ticking up, Jim, as you mentioned here in the fourth quarter? Jim Foote : Well, clearly, it's a two-part question, which I think Jamie answered a second ago. We have got a ton of capacity and availability to bring on more business from a physical infrastructure perspective without spending any capital to do that. But you are not going to grow the business forever without having to add additional employees, mainly because we have tons of locomotives in storage and all of that. So the question is, with your operating performance. When you get to the point where your train length gets to the point where long enough or heavy enough where you need to split that train. And when you split at train, you need to have the additional employees to utilize in order to be able to operate it. And so we are moving in to a new level now. But what you have seen over the last few years and what was highlighted in great detail in the last few months is, today we can do things from a staffing perspective the railroads and the peers couldn't do. Listen, I have been doing this a long time. If you would had this kind of traffic surge across the rail network in North America four, five years ago, we would be now talking about gridlock across all the major cities in the country and we wouldn't be doing anything. And now with the common mindset of how you run a railroad, we are able to respond, we are able to pivot, we are nimble, we can add capacity, we can shrink capacity, we can right size our business and we can do that much more effectively and much more logically and thoughtfully. And God, I hope we get to the day sooner the better. But we got to start hiring more and more people because the business is growing and growing and growing and Mark is just not going to mile of the park every single day. But in the meantime, we are not going to add back assets, as Jamie said, when we don't need them. But the minute we do, we talk about that on here five times a day, the minute we do, we will put them on so we can move the freight. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Bascome Majors : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, I want to go back to an earlier question. Can you refresh us on your comfort level with leverage, given some of the uncertainty on either tax policy, economy, et cetera? With that buyback, what are the guardrails of the upper ends that you are watching for to perhaps tap the brakes once you start buying stock again? Kevin Boone : Look, as I talked about, we have $3 billion of cash on our balance sheet. So I have got to get through that before we ever even would think about leverage. Plus, we are generating significant amount of cash at this point. So when you look at the algorithm that we can create with that and it's quite compelling where we are on the leverage standpoint, we are in a great position. We didn't go under stress during this significant decline in the second quarter. We had access to capital, which is what we always want to have with our strong investment grade rating. So that's important. And you want to be at a point where you can always have the ability to be opportunistic. And so I think where we are today allows for that flexibility. If the opportunity arises, we can react and leverage the opportunity when it's there. So, I think we are quite comfortable today with where we are. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is open. Justin Long : Thanks and good afternoon. So headed into this year, you had talked about some irregular year-over-year headwinds. Kevin, I know you had called out D&A, lower gains on sale, real estate sales, other revenue. I know you are not giving guidance on 2021, but just from a high level, are there any unique items like that that we should be modeling? Or do you think next year, it's more of a clean year where we should see the underlying operating leverage of the business play out? Kevin Boone : Yes. I mean, we will obviously get more into that on the next call here. But depreciation would be a similar headwind to what we have right now. But I would also point out our depreciation relative to our CapEx is probably the smallest gap in the industry right there. So probably not the step-up that we saw this year on the depreciation side. We don't have any significant life study that created a headwind this year. Real estate taxes will continue to be a headwind in the next year, probably around the same level it was. Maybe a little bit less of a headwind going into next year. Inflation, we think inflation remains relatively modest. No significant pick up there, which is good. Outside of that, as we get into it on the next call, we will highlight any other things that come up. Justin Long : Okay. And based on your comment about D&A being pretty close to CapEx, it sounds like your expectation for 100% free cash flow conversion isn't going to change in the near term? Kevin Boone : We are very focused on our free cash flow conversion. Justin Long : Okay. I will leave it at that. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is from David Ross with Stifel. Your line is open. David Ross : Good morning, gentlemen. Lots of good stuff to talk about. But I want to talk about one of the lingering pains in terms of coal. What's the latest on inventory levels and outlook? I think Kevin your recent comments at an industry conference about maybe getting flat to up comps in 2021. So any more color on coal would be helpful. Kevin Boone : Yes. Sure, David. So you want to just stick to domestic coal? Or are you interested in export as well? David Ross : Give it all for me. Kevin Boone : All right. Perfect. We will start with domestic. That's the largest part of our coal business. So the stockpiles right now, to your question, are at or below sort of averages, both in the North and in the South. We have seen a good summer for burn. It was kind of hot both in North and South. So the stockpiles did diminish a bit. Gas prices, net gas prices, we saw them creep up to $2.50 or so. They came back down. Now they are back up to the mid to high twos. We would like to see them above $2.80, really the economics work for the utilities to start to burn more coal. I am really encouraged by sort of the November contract and the forward curve into 2021, as we see it above $3, which is quite encouraging. So hopefully that continues and we can expect to move more coal going into the new year and in Q4, in the back half of Q4. On the export side, starting with met. Met, right now, it's actually about 75% of our export portfolio. It used to be about 60%. It was about 60/40, 65/35. But now it's about 75% met, 25% thermal. Most of that met is going to Europe, about 55%, 30% to Asia. The benchmarks, as you know, have been challenged. We saw some restocking in the quarter in India and Brazil. Unfortunately the Chinese quotas on Australian coal have been a headwind as that's keeping the benchmark prices low and it's offsetting some of the outputs for our U.S. coal. So we have had some issues there coupled with monsoon season and obviously the COVID situation has really impacted industrial production worldwide. But mostly, the met side of the business has really been a price story, more than a volume story. Different on the thermal side, it's really been a volume story. Our thermal coal, about 75% of that thermal coal goes to Asia, mostly India, some to Morocco as well. No longer any coal going to Europe, which used to be a big outlet for us. But we have no thermal coal going to Europe these days. API2 has been a headwind. It was under $60 for the quarter. India, the COVID situation in India has really impacted a lot of the volumes there. However, things are picking up and we should see some increased volumes in the fourth quarter and we will see what happens as the COVID situation plays itself out going into next year. At the beginning of the year, we provided some guidance on our export coal. We said we were going to be somewhere around 30, low 30s million tons for 2020. My best guess right now is, we will be right at 30 million tons for the year. David Ross : That's helpful around the world color. Thank you very much. Kevin Boone : Yes. No problem. Operator : Our next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jordan Alliger : Yes. I know you have talked about sort of the lasting efficiencies and the structural changes. Maybe I missed it a little. But I was wondering, if you could perhaps give some further example of what some of these changes are that has allowed metrics such as cars processed per hour do so well? Or even frankly, just keeping headcount flat while volumes sort of surged here sequentially? So I know you talked about the structural changes. I am assuming that with the operating plan and things along those lines. But to the extent you can provide some additional color around that would be great? Kevin Boone : Thanks for the question, Jordan. I guess some of the easiest ways I can put it is, we are constantly analyzing the plan. So this is, when you think about the cars switched per man hour, I go out with a number of my team members and we take a look at different terminals and we question what we do and how we do it and change the way we do things. Just because that's the way it's always been done, doesn't mean that's how you do it. And those are kind of the guidelines when you think of scheduling railroading. So some yards you may have switched cars one way. We have been able to find different ways of switching cars that made it more efficient. And I mean that's an ongoing process that we are always going through. When you think about a network as complicated as CSX can be, we have hundreds of terminals and yards and different areas where we switch boxcars. We probably have some of the greatest opportunity to make those changes and continue to make those changes as we move forward. And then when you think about the service plan with respect to growing our train size. Well, we said it earlier that we were blessed when we got here 3.5 years ago that we have a plant that was built beyond what it needed to be. And it wasn't necessarily being run in a PSR method. So we have been able to increase our train sizes, move traffic better. And when you think about our train miles, we have reduced our train miles significantly, just by moving traffic in a better pattern. So as we continue to find those opportunities and they are still out there, we still find them each and every day. The team is evolving every day with respect to how our plan works and how scheduled railroading continues to develop those different efficiencies, there is more and more opportunities we continue forward just to find those opportunities to move things better, quicker and more reliable for our customer. Jordan Alliger : Thank you for the color. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I know you spent a lot of time on the sustainable operations and you have the slide, you added the ESG recognition. Mark, as you are talking to customers and when we think about this, is this just a nice to have for us right now, maybe some investors open up a new investor base? Or is this really starting to move the needle in your conversations with the customers as it relates to their total freight wallet? Or are those conversations still just service price? Mark Wallace : Excellent question. No, I think ESG has really gone from a talking point to having a real world impact now, especially with our customers. And so several of our customers in several negotiations, sitting down and really peeling back and showing them everything that we have done at CSX over the last number of years. We have been a leader in this ESG space for a very long time. And as Jim said in his opening remarks, we are very proud of our leadership position there and being recognized by the Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Sustainability Index and others and we are opening up having those discussions with customers and showing them that clearly our safety performance is a big discussion there as well. And I can tell you, one of the major, major contracts that came up for bid this year, one of the big factors was they really want us the business was around ESG and safety. And Jamie and I spent a lot of time with this customer talking about these things and it's having a real impact. I would tell you also, as customers look and especially some of the big shippers out there, retail shippers, as they look to their efficiency targets and their targets to emission targets, taking trucks off the highway, given all the efficiencies that Jim talked about are real. And if they can move more traffic on CSX and take trucks off the highway, that clearly leads to them achieving a lot of their efficiency metrics. And so real world impact, real world negotiations and it's paying off specifically in many deals that we have looked at this year. Jon Chappell : That's great to hear. Thanks for the insights, Mark. Mark Wallace : Absolutely. Operator : Next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open. David Vernon : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the time. Mark, I wanted to talk a little bit about intermodal and what you have seen in the pipeline over the next three years is going to put you guys in less of a position to maybe take what the truck market gives you and more of a position to maybe improve the product, either at an infrastructure level or channel level as you think about what you guys are investing in the intermodal side? what is it that's in the pipeline that you are excited about that's going to get you maybe a little bit better than market growth in that market? Mark Wallace : Yes. So let me talk about the market and then I will ask Jamie to talk about some of the efficiencies that they are working on in the terminals, because his group has the intermodal terminals. And so listen, we really like, we love the intermodal business. We think there is a lot of growth. And as I have said before, this intermodal space is one where we can continue to grow faster than the economy repeatedly every year. And so we are doing a lot of different things, working on a lot of new different products with customers, looking to take more share off the highway, really talk about the benefits of intermodal. We have lot of customers out there and we are working with them and the different shippers on the benefits of converting that freight. E-commerce is obviously having a very big impact on our business. And we like that business and we think it's going to continue to grow here in the future. And so we are thinking differently about things that we need to do going forward and position ourselves to capture a lot of that e-commerce growth in the future. With that, Jamie, do you want to talk about the efficiencies in the terminals? Jamie Boychuk : Yes. Our terminals, again, we have got terminals that were, I think, probably over built for the time when they were built and we are actually getting to utilize them to a maximum. I have got an unbelievable intermodal team led by Marcelo Estrada and Scott Marshall and their team. They have been able to, over a number of years here, put automated cranes and technology with XGate, allowing truck drivers to flow freely in and out of our terminals, giving us opportunities to use GPS cranes to operate autonomously in some areas. So we have been able to bring our dwell times down over the past couple of years from up over 24, 26 hours down to 15 to 14 hours in some circumstances of origin dwell. That's significant. When you turn your traffic over in these terminals, you gain space. You are able to handle more. And the traffic volume just come our way. We haven't hit a bottleneck. We are definitely inviting more and more come through the gate and looking forward to it. Operator : Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good evening everyone. Kevin, maybe, just to start off with you. You obviously have the high quality problem of apparently having more cash than you know what to do with. So maybe you can share some of your thoughts on the M&A environment. You have seen some of your peers going to make investments in infrastructure assets, both rail-related and adjacent. So do you have any opportunities out there on this? And kind of do you expect to move on that anytime soon? And Jim, maybe as a follow-up on the ESG question. Obviously very exciting and very encouraging to see that come up so much. But do you get the sense that shippers are looking to move from truck to rail on a structural basis? Or are they seeing rail as somewhat of a stop gap until we get to electrified trucks? I am trying to figure out how do you make these ESG gains sticky. Jamie Boychuk : All right, let me answer the second question first. Absolutely, it's significant. It's a significant change when major, major customers, users of the logistics supply chain globally begin to make public commitments to reducing their carbon footprint. To be able to walk in the door and say, I can help you do that. In fact, I might even be able to make you get to your targets about it like a decade early because I am 75% cleaner than all these trucks you got running around out there and I am just as reliable. The good news was that we couldn't do that if there was ESG 10 years ago or whatever, we weren't reliable enough, you wouldn't be able to have this kind of conversation. So the timing of our service offering coming together with a real, not just PR, but a real commitment globally to people that want to be able to do this is creating a lot of opportunity for us in all lines of our business and we want to be as environmentally responsible as we can be. And so to the extent we move coal, people don't like that, but to the extent that we can be a huge player in other lines of business and be a facilitator for improvements from a client perspective, that's a great news for us. I will let Kevin follow up a little bit. But on the M&A issue. We have got a tremendous amount, as I said earlier, I can't remember what's the reason for the question was, but from an M&A perspective, as it relates to rail, to the extent that we now have a common focus and a common purpose across the rail network as individual entities, it is opening up great opportunities for us to work together to further become more effective and efficient as we interchange traffic with one another, as we do business with one another, as we understand our systems and we get to exchange for information with one another better than we did before, all with the sole purpose of being able to grow the business on a network basis, it creates the capabilities for the individual companies to achieve a lot of the benefits and the synergies, that before everybody thought, well, the only way you can do that is go out and spend a couple of hundred billion dollars to buy some other railroad. You know, we don't look like it. We are much, much smarter than what we used to be. And so we are eagerly pursuing all of those kinds of opportunities today with the sole purpose because it makes us better competitors individually, as individual railroad companies and as an industry. Kevin Boone : Yes. And just add to that, Ravi, I think you are right in terms of our cash position today. We are in a position of strength. It gives us a lot of opportunity for us to invest in our business. It's been exciting as we have gone through our capital program, we are still going through that for next year and the years ahead, we are finding some really good opportunities on some really high return investments. And so that's going to be the first priority for our cash going forward. But as we sit here today, I would point out, we just finished a quarter where, if you look at it, intermodal for the first time, contributed the most to our revenue profile and coal was the least in our history. So on a percentage of our revenue, coal was the least it has ever been and intermodal has been the best and we did 56.9%. Here we are in a position of strength. It gives us a lot of opportunity to invest in our railroad. And we will look at anything that will strengthen our franchise over the next few years. So I am excited about looking at those opportunities and driving value for us. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital. Your line is open. Walter Spracklin : Hi. Thanks very much. Good afternoon everyone. So, I want to turn, Mark, if I could to ask you about volume visibility. I know when the pandemic really hit in March, that visibility tightened up quite a bit and was difficult to see directionally which way volumes were going, other than down in the early period. And then Jim you mentioned, obviously the big rebound. Mark when you look at and speak to your customers now, how would you characterize that visibility? I know you touched a little bit on coal, you touched on intermodal with some of the opportunities there. Can you go through a few of the others and just directionally indicate whether that visibility is improving as you go into 2021? Or is it really a coin toss here as to which direction it goes kind of on a broad segment-by-segment basis. Mark Wallace : No. Thanks, Walter, great question. I think clearly the visibility we had when the bottom fell out sort of in Q2 when the economy shut down, they didn't send notes to us or emails to us and saying, we are closing. It was kind of overnight, things just tanked. As things are coming back, our job has been, even while the pandemic was going on, the sales and marketing team were working from home, we needed a priority to stay close to our customers, check in on Zoom and Teams and all the fancy video conferencing technology. Everyone had laptops and computers at home and phones and we made it a priority for them to stay close and really figure out to the best of what they could tell us and then we can relay that information to Jamie and team. But it was a challenge for them to even know. Things were so dynamic, things were changing so rapidly. It was very tough to pinpoint them. And when the volumes came back, it was a snap back literally within days and weeks. And so it was very hard. Our auto business was effectively, you know, you would open up the morning revenue report and it was zeros and then a week later boom, the plants are reopening. And they said, we are going to one shift for probably for a month and then we will tell you when we are going to go to two. And then a couple of days later, they say, look, we are going two or three right away and it was like go wide. So we had to react pretty quickly to that and it was a challenge. Two weeks ago, we had our fifth customer engagement forum. We did it usually customers come here to Jacksonville for a day or so where we talk to them about what's going on in their markets and their business and share ideas. We did this by Zoom meeting and we spent a lot of time. Jim was there, myself and Jamie and really listening to a lot of their questions and their views on what we think is probably is going to happen, likely to happen. And I would say, most are cautiously optimistic as we head into the back half of Q4 and into 2021. There is visibility on some markets. And clearly intermodal, we know what's happening there and we have got some pretty good visibility. We talk to our channel partners in the ports and our international steamship lines and clearly they are seeing a lot of strength in those markets and the best visibility they have now is, we see continued strength and replenishment beyond Chinese New Year and deep into Q1, as I said earlier. So from that perspective, good. Coal I talked about a little bit earlier and while we started to clearly the markets are dynamic there and we will see what happens with natural gas domestically. But the world markets clearly have an impact on our export business. And for merchandise, I mean, lot of people are watching what's going on? There still remains many risks, right. The pandemic, what's going to happen with the pandemic. There is other geopolitical factors that we are monitoring extremely closely. The election is coming up in a couple of weeks. Government stimulus, as I said, the effects of the pandemic and on their workers and everyone is watching that. I mean we are heading into the fall and into the winter and people are concerned if the cases spike again, will they be able to continue producing. And then the health of the overall economy and what's that going to look like as we head into the end of the year and into next year. So visibility is murky. It's been a challenging year, probably something that none of us have ever seen in our careers before. But our job is to continue to stay close and provide as much clarity as we can to Jamie and the team so that we are prepared to handle the freight when it comes back. Walter Spracklin : Okay. That's great color. I appreciate it, Mark. Operator : Our last question is from Jason Seidl with Cowen. Your line is open. Jason Seidl : Yes. Thank you, operator. And guys, I appreciate the opportunity to back clean-up here. Jim, you mentioned something that intrigued me. You mentioned about railroads now working more together than they have in the past. I was wondering, if you can give us some examples of what you guys are doing now? And also, do you see more of that in the future as some of your other partners go more through the life cycle of PSR? Jim Foote : Jamie might be able to jump in with a little bit. Exactly. Again, we basically or have had a group of individuals that work together for years and years and years and built this model that more efficiently and effectively and reliably runs a railroad company. And they are now in one way, shape or another, having a significant influence on how those companies operate. And we think of ourselves, obviously, as standalone entities. But we want to work together from an industry perspective so that we can grow the business. It's not about forcing unnatural gateways to move traffic farther and out of routes or maybe you can make an extra $12.50 per car by hauling something 500 miles longer. And at the end of the day, when you have business practices like that, you drive all business off the railroad and it moves by truck. So at the end of the day with a narrow focus like that, you are shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, cut and cut and cut and cut and shrink and shrink. So we are all about growing the business and to grow the business by working together as a network, 50% of the business originates on somebody else or terminates on somebody else. So I am not an island. And so I think that's the MO going forward and it's not a foreign concept. When you talk to the other railroad executives, whether it's me or it's Jamie or it's Mark or whether it's anybody else in the organization, there is a much greater sense of urgency and a much greater focus on customer service than I think there has been in the past. And hopefully that not only continues, but hopefully we will begin to get better and better and better at that, so we can become more relevant in the transportation market place and grow what today, the overall share of our transportation spend is very, very small. So we want to get bigger. Jamie Boychuk : Just, I would say, Jim nailed it down. When you have a partner that thinks like you and acts like you, it sure makes it a whole lot easier to do business with them. Always, we had issues over the years with interchange points. Traffic will get locked up there. Customers didn't have visibility between railroad and railroad. So as we continue to have partners around us, who are getting better and better at what they do, it makes a big difference for our customers and it helps to grow the industry. So it's exciting to work with some of the western roads, who are really starting to come around and work with us. And of course, the Canadians know the game. So it makes a big difference when we can all flow together. Jason Seidl : Well, I appreciate the color and time as always, gentlemen. Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation on today's call. And you may now disconnect your lines. Jim Foote : Thank you, everyone, for participating.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the CSX Corporation Q3 [sic] [Q4] 2020 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Slater, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. Bill Slater : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Chief Financial Officer; and Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim Foote : Thanks, Bill, and thank you to everyone listening in today. I want to begin by recognizing all of CSX's employees for continually responding to the challenges of 2020. Our results are a testament to our amazing people and the strength of our company. The core principles instilled over the last few years allowed us to act decisively with coordinated effort and alignment across the company. Over the course of the year, we reexamined every process from the ground up to identify and eliminate unnecessary steps across the railroad. And as a result, uncovered significant opportunities to build upon the progress made during our transformation. These changes will provide benefits for years to come. Now, let's turn to Slide 5 of the presentation and our fourth quarter financial results. Operating income grew 5% to $1.2 billion and the operating ratio improved 300 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 57%. Our reported earnings per share were $0.99, but I want to point out that this figure includes a $0.05 per share charge related to the early retirement of debt. For the full-year, despite lower overall economic activity and historic demand volatility, CSX produced a full-year operating ratio of 58.8%, exceeding our initial guidance of a 59% operating ratio. Moving to Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue declined 2% on 4% higher volumes as intermodal revenue growth was more than offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue and declines in coal. Merchandise revenue and volume were flat as revenue growth in chemicals, ag and food, metals and equipment, and fertilizers was offset by declines in other markets and lower fuel surcharges. Intermodal revenue grew 6% on a 11% higher volumes to new quarterly record levels. This performance was driven by a combination of strong demand for transportation services due to inventory replenishments and volume growth from East Coast Works. Coal revenue was down 18% and 9% lower volumes as the coal business continues to be negatively impacted by lower domestic utility demand, industrial production and global benchmark prices. Other revenue was down 6% as increased intermodal storage revenue was more than offer by a higher reserve for freight and transit and lower demurrage charges. Turning to Slide 7, we remain committed to being the safest railroad. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a new quarterly record low number of personal injuries and full-year record lows for both personal injuries and train accidents. While our efforts to build a culture of safety can be seen in the annual performance trends, we can always be better. We have launched new near miss and workplace hazard reporting programs that encourage employees to report potential safety concerns. We are also working to increase awareness of incidents and trends by conducting joint terminal tours with CSX management and local labor representatives. This proactive approach to reporting and communications, it's helping drive increased employee engagement as we identify and eliminate unsafe practices across the railroad. Turning to Slide 8. We have previously discussed how the use of autonomous car and track inspection technologies is helping us meet our safety goals, and we will continue to invest in new programs to improve safety. However, we have a much broader vision and the increased use of technology in our business. Technology is foundational to our growth. We are actively investing in new technologies across the railroad, but a barely scratching the surface of what is possible. We are making our intermodal yard smarter and more autonomous. We are piloting programs that will further fuel efficiency, such as allowing us to optimize speed across the full trip of a train. And in the field, we're getting rid of paper-based processes and converting to digital ones that allow faster communications that are data capture, it improves safety compliance. As we look to the future, we are upgrading our dispatch system to lay the groundwork for enhanced network performance, through dynamic real-time routing decisions. We see opportunities to implement predictive analytics in our maintenance programs to both reduce mechanical failures and more systematically identify areas of track most in need of investment. Additionally, beyond these significant operating benefits, we are investing to improve our customer experience and create easier and more streamlined processes for our customers to do business with CSX. Every action we take is designed to make CSX smarter, faster and more reliable. Turning to Slide 9. We remain committed to sustainably managing our own business, as well as helping our customers reduce their emissions. In 2020, customer shipping with CSX avoided more than 10 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. To put this into context, this figure is roughly equivalent to the emissions produced powering all the buildings in New York City for almost a full-year. We remain focused on furthering these environmental benefits, not only by continuing to improve the efficiency of our own operations, but also by providing a reliable alternative to trucking that allows our customers to meet their emissions goals without having to sacrifice the reliability of their supply chain. We have set ambitious long-term goals in order to remain leaders in sustainability. And we are committed to expanding the benefits rail offers as the most sustainable mode of land-based transportation. Let's turn to Slide 10 and look at our operating performance for the quarter. Clearly, the simultaneous rapid increase in both volumes and COVID-related employee absences impacted the network, but overall, the railroad is running well and we were still able to drive incremental efficiencies. Locomotive productivity achieved a new quarterly record for GTMs for available horsepower and we set a new fourth quarter record for fuel efficiency, a 0.94 gallons per thousand gross ton miles. On Slide 11, our improved efficiency is further illustrated, which compares volumes and asset levels against the pre-COVID and prior year periods. As volumes return, our revised operating plan is aligning us to operate at a sustainably higher level of asset utilization. This is reflected both in the sequential trends, where volumes have increased at twice the rate of asset redeployment, as well as double-digit productivity gains we have maintained between year over year volume and asset levels in the second-half. While our team did an excellent job of working during this period to make the network more efficient, our number one priority remains providing our customers a high-quality service product. There is still significant leverage built into the operating plan. But as volumes grow, we have been and will continue to add crews and locomotives as needed to serve our customers well. Turning to Slide 12, our carload trip plan performance was 75% for the quarter and intermodal trip plan was 84%. Like all transportation and logistics companies, we have faced challenges from both the rising number of COVID cases along with broader supply chain disruptions from volatile demand, inventory shortages and imbalanced freight flows. This team has done an admiral job navigating this environment. But we expect these trip plan figures will return to and then exceed our results from the beginning of 2020. While our performance is still at industry leading levels, we hold ourselves to a higher standard. I'll now turn it over to Kevin for a review of the finances. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. After a challenging year, we are all excited to turn the page to 2021. That said we accomplished a lot this past year, which sets us up well, as the economy recovers from the impact of the pandemic. While many markets remain challenged, we did see an improving business environment in the fourth quarter and as a result delivered both volume and operating income growth for the first time in 2020. We manage costs through the year and made sustainable improvements to the train plan which will drive operating leverage as volumes return. We once again delivered a quarterly record operating ratio. Excluding real estate gains, this marked the third quarterly record in 2020, an extraordinary accomplishment by this entire team. This past year, we focused on what we could control. Navigating the uncertain and volatile business environment, while successfully driving efficiencies across the business. Our goal in 2021 and beyond is to leverage the growth ahead of us, by sustaining these efficiency gains and driving further improvement across the business. Looking at the fourth quarter income statement. Revenue was down 2% as continued volume growth and pricing gains in our intermodal business were offset by the ongoing effects of weak coal demand and lower fuel recovery. Merchandise revenue was in line with the fourth quarter of 2019, but we have seen positive momentum as revenue improved 5% sequentially and from the third quarter, above normal seasonality. Total expenses were down 7% in the quarter on a 4% increase in volume, walking down the expense line items, labor and fringe was 11% lower, reflecting the benefit of the train plan optimization and an 8% reduction in total headcount. Throughout 2020, our operating team continued to refine the train plan in response to the dynamic volume environment. These improvements enabled significant efficiency in the fourth quarter, as crew starts were down 11% and while overall volumes were up 4%. Lower crew starts in the quarter also translated to fewer active trains and, as a result, reduced the need for locomotives. The smaller fleet drove a 14% reduction in our locomotive labor expense. We were also able to hold the line on the significant reductions made earlier in the year to our engineering contract labor expense, as well as our intermodal terminal workforce, even as volumes continue to increase sequentially. Lifts per man-hour, a key measure of efficiency for our intermodal workforce improved 23% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Moving forward, we are preparing for growth. The current environment remains challenging and unpredictable with COVID related mark offs, significantly impacting pockets of our network. We wish the best for these employees and hope for their speedy recovery. Moving forward, we will hopefully begin to see improvement from current levels. We continue to focus on crew availability and are currently accelerating our first half hiring efforts to be prepared in the event of stronger demand. We expect headcount will likely exceed attrition in the first half of the year to provide flexibility, should demand surprise positively, particularly in the second half. We will manage it closely and adjust accordingly, as we monitor the trajectory of the potential volume recovery. MS&O expense increased 4% or $19 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for the $20 million headwind from real estate gains, MS&O expense would have been roughly flat, as efficiency and volume-related savings were offset by inflation and other items. The improvements to our train plan, I mentioned before, also drove savings, including lower crew travel and repositioning costs, as well as lower locomotive materials and contracted service expense. Real estate gains were minimal in the fourth quarter. Looking beyond 2020, we continue to manage a pipeline of future properties that we will monetize when conditions are favorable. Our base case is for real estate sales activity to be roughly flat. As I've said before, we will also continue to pursue opportunities to leverage our real estate to generate recurring revenue streams. Fuel expense was $77 million favorable, a 36% improvement year-over-year, driven by a 33% decrease in the per gallon price and record fourth quarter fuel efficiency. We continue to invest in technologies that will drive further improvement in fuel efficiency, widening the advantage over truck and demonstrating our continued commitment to sustainability. Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $3 million or 1% in the quarter. This reflects a larger asset base as well as the impact of a road and track depreciation study. Depreciation expense is expected to be a $10 million to $20 million headwind in 2021. Equipment rents expense increased $4 million or 5%, as higher days per load across all markets resulted in increased freight car rents. Turning below the line. Interest expense was flat, as higher net debt balances were offset by a lower weighted average coupon. Other income decreased $48 million, reflecting a make-whole charge related to the early redemption of $500 million of long-term notes that were set to mature in 2023. Income tax expense increased $24 million or 11%, due to higher pre-tax income, as well as the cycling of certain state and federal tax benefits recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019. Closing out the income statement. CSX delivered operating income of $1. 2 billion, reflecting a fourth quarter record 57% operating ratio. Turning to the cash side of the equation on Slide 15. On a full year basis, capital investment was relatively flat even during the pandemic, we remain committed to investments that prioritize the safety and reliability of our core track, bridge and signal infrastructure. This commitment will not change. And by level loading the maintenance spend, we are improving the safety and fluidity of our network without requiring a step-up in core infrastructure spend going forward. Capital allocation remains a focus. And we have a healthy pipeline of high return investments, we expect to invest in this year. In 2020, free cash flow before dividends was $2. 6 billion, down versus 2019, primarily reflecting lower operating income but also impacted by lower proceeds from property sales. Free cash flow generation remains a key focus of this team. Even during 2020's challenging environment, free cash flow conversion, while net income was about 95%. We expect to stay above 90%, even with slightly higher CapEx and an increase in expected cash tax rate. Our cash and short-term investment balance remains strong, ending the quarter at $3.1 billion. Our expectation remains that this balance will normalize over time as we continue to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Foote : Great. Thanks a lot Kevin. Concluding with Slide 17, we expect to return to growth in 2021 for both CSX and the U.S. economy. While much debate remains around the pace of this growth as we've transitioned from COVID headwinds to potential stimulus fuel tailwinds, we believe CSX is well-positioned to grow volumes faster than the prevailing GDP growth rate in 2021. Merchandise volumes should outpace industrial production growth as we convert additional truck volumes off the highway and onto CSX. We expect intermodal volumes to grow even faster than merchandise as the business continues to benefit from the ongoing inventory restocking and a tight truck market. And following an extremely challenging year, we expect the coal business to begin recovering from 2020 trough levels. As volumes increase, we will drive incremental operating leverage by efficiently absorbing the additional cars and containers into our revised train plan. We still have significant opportunity to add volumes onto the existing trains and we'll have train starts as needed to maintain high levels of customer service. We project full year CapEx of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. This spend reflects ongoing investments in our core infrastructure, combined with several high-return growth investments for technology and sales and marketing initiatives. We will continue to evaluate attractive growth investment opportunities as they arise. But from a network perspective, we still have ample line of road and terminal capacity. Lastly, we remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders. We will repurchase shares through our ongoing buyback program and we will look to be opportunistic with share repurchases as we utilize our roughly $6 billion of buyback authority. The actions taken in 2020 have positioned CSX for success and we are taking the necessary steps to ensure that we are prepared to handle the expected growth in 2021. This past year has proved that although we have accomplished great things during our transformation, our team is still finding opportunities to push this company to new heights. I enter this year as excited as I have ever been for what the future holds for CSX. Thank you and I'll now turn it back to Bill for questions. As you may have noted at the beginning of the call, Mark Wallace is unfortunately not joining us today as he's dealing with a non-COVID personal health issue. The rest of the team will do its best to answer any marketing questions you may have. Bill Slater : Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time, I would ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question. With that, we will now take questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now conduct our question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is open. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. Well, Jim, I guess maybe we can start there, unfortunate for Mark, he's not here, but you guys do sound like you have some confidence that merchandise, I think you've said, will grow in excess of industrial production and intermodal even better than your merchandise outcomes. So, I guess, are there any specific examples you can give us where you're winning in the network and delivering this new service product that we've heard about for a couple of years? Now how's that translating into confidence this year? Jim Foote : Well, in many respects, the conversion of trucks up the highway back onto the rail system has been -- we've talked about it for many years where it's our existing customers today, where we're doing a lot of work with them already in their boxcar fleet. And so we know them very well, but we've never really had an opportunity to take a look at their book of business from what they're doing on the other -- on the doors on the other side of the plant, so to speak, where they're sending it out in truck. And now that our service product has become more reliable, we've been able to capture more and more that wallet share. And that applies whether it's in force products, whether it's in pulp board, whether it's in metals, whether it's in chemicals, you name it, we've been able to do that. And I think that's clearly the strategy that we will continue to pursue, along with looking at ways through our transflow opportunities, where we can reach customers' business that before we didn't have the capability to handle because we didn't focus on kind of the last-mile business if we didn't directly connect to a customer's location. So it's a combination of different factors that spread out really across the entire spectrum of merchandise, and again principally because our service now is as reliable as a truck. And we - obviously, maybe it's the easy way, but let's go to our customers that we already know and do business with and shake the tree there. And there is a ton of opportunity for us. And again, similarly, in our intermodal franchise, where we're getting more businesses, we're looking at lanes that before we couldn't compete in because we had somewhat of a disjointed network, and we've worked hard to rationalize and improve the service on the network and that's bringing us additional business. So we've been building on this for a number of years, and we expect it to continue to pay benefits in 2021. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you, Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Your line is open. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good afternoon. Jim, maybe you could just talk a bit about the missed business opportunity, given COVID. Kevin kind of threw out some thoughts that there was missed opportunity. Can you quantify your thoughts looking back and maybe what that means as how fast you bring employees back into 2021? Jim Foote : In terms of missed opportunities, we have \u2013 we, CSX are no different than anybody else in the country. And our employees have been impacted by the virus to the same degree as everyone else, if not more, in the transportation sector, because they're essential workers and they're out there on the frontline in and out every single day, making sure the goods get across the country and we can take care of people that are -- have the luxury to sit home and ride this thing out. So if we've missed any opportunities, it's been as the surge of traffic came back in the third quarter, just about the time the virus began to tick up. And then clearly, it took off with the Thanksgiving holiday. So we're aware of that. We're prepared for that. And maybe we've missed something along the way. I think what Kevin was more and more concerned was and Kevin is not be able to express his opinions on this. We think that based upon all the work we've done for the company to make sure that we can grow this business. And with the potential for a rebound in the economy and with the potential for maybe stimulus and with the potential for maybe additional transportation spend by the government, we don't want to miss out on something if it comes along, we want to be ready to handle it. So we're planning, we're preparing. We're making sure -- clearly, we have track capacity. Clearly, we have assets in terms of locomotives, et cetera. What we want to make sure is, we have the employees. And this is not like we can go hire some guy off the street and put them to work the next day. It takes five, six months to train these people to get them ready. So we're aware of the curve that we want to make sure that we're managing to the curve. And so, I think that's what Kevin was referring to, in any missed opportunity, was to make sure that we're prepared to handle growth when it comes. Ken Hoexter : Thanks, Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Amit Mehrotra : Thank you, operator. Hi, everybody. Kevin, I guess, with the dynamic of intermodal growth outpacing merchandise growth this year, do you think yields can be up in 2021 versus 2020? And then if you can just also talk about the magnitude of OR improvement? How should we think about OR improvement, given the benefits of higher volume, but then obviously, some of the adverse mix that comes with the intermodal outpacing merchandise? Kevin Boone : Yes. I think, as I mentioned last quarter, we had the greatest contribution from our Intermodal business, which has traditionally been viewed as a least profitable segment of our business. But yes, we put up a record OR. I think we again proved that in the fourth quarter. You saw the intermodal business, obviously, having the strongest growth. And again, we were able to deliver record OR performance As we go into 2021 as with any year, there's normal inflation costs that you have to offset and overcome as you want to improve your margins going into next year. We have labor inflation a little bit higher than what we saw in 2020. We have health and welfare costs ticking up a little bit more than what we saw last year. But really inflation, when I look over the long-term average, it's probably a little bit under that long-term average, so not a huge significant headwind. But really, the variable here is going to be the growth. I'm very confident if growth exceeds our expectations that we'll drop that through at a very attractive incremental margin. Our goal here is to be prepared for the growth to grow operating income. That's really the goal of what we're talking about around here. It's exciting to talk about and prepare for growth. And so that's what we're looking at. I mentioned in the first-half of the year, we'll accelerate our hiring to make sure we're prepared for whatever environment comes in the second-half. And Jamie will quickly adjust accordingly if things change on us, which as we know, this has been a dynamic environment and we just want to be ahead of the curve and be prepared for it and be able to deliver. I think we all say, shame on us, if we can't deliver the growth when it comes. And so that's what we're talking about here internally. Amit Mehrotra : Could you just answer the yield question in terms of whether you think yields will be up year-over-year in 2021? Kevin Boone : Yes. I think when you look at the first half of the year, we'll have some fuel surcharge. Fuel will still be a headwind really in the first quarter, will start -- that will start to moderate as you get in the second quarter. So, second half of the year, you'll see a little bit less fuel surcharge headwind. Coal in the first half of the year, probably on a yield basis, will be a little bit of a headwind. Obviously, that market\u2019s pretty dynamic, particularly on the export side. But see some support going in the second half of the year. So, I would say, definitely expect second half to be improved over first half, but that always goes back to mix as well as we see some of our higher RPU business, whether it's chemicals or other areas, see continued strength, that certainly helps the dynamic there. But the coal dynamic should moderate first half of the year and really not be as much of a headwind going forward. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good afternoon and great job on the quarter. Without specifically focusing on where the OR can go in 2021. I sort of wanted to ask a longer-term question. I mean, it sort of seems feasible to do a 55 OR this year. But, I mean, it just seems like you guys are pushing the boundaries of what we thought might have been either remotely possible for an Eastern rail. So I would just love to hear your thoughts on how you view the potential for the longer-term profitability of the business. I mean, obviously, you guys are gaining share. And Jim, you highlighted a number of efficiencies that will come in the future from technology investments. So any thought there? And then just sort of lastly, Jim, if you could sort of tell us what you think about the difference between a long-haul and a short-haul railroad as it comes down to, it's a long-term profitability and if there are truly already any structural differences? Thank you. Jim Foote : Great, Allison. Good one question. So, a couple -- three years ago, it was just only a couple of three years ago when we were in New York talking about how we were going to take this wore out, beat up, run down railroad and have a 60% operating ratio in a couple of three years, and everybody said, you guys are crazy, can't be done. And now I think you said you want double nickels here win next year. We're trying to grow operating income and earnings per share, so that we can reward our shareholders and not just get singularly focused on these operating ratio. So the operating ratio pretty much will be what it is. Obviously, you saw what we can do when we get our hands dirty and we get focused on what needs to be done in order to run the company better. I truly believe, as Jamie and his team get in collaboration with Mark and the sales and marketing team, collaborate on how we need to get this company running more -- even much, much, much more reliably and faster in the future in order to provide a better quality product to our customers. The necessary result, the ultimate result of all of that is that we take a lot of crazy unnecessary activities out of the system that we do today, and that drives down the cost. So without focusing on a specific reduction in the operating ratio, I firmly believe that we will continue to drive efficiency, but as we \u2013 and we'll do that as we focus on \u2013 and we'll focus \u2013 as we focused on driving \u2013 building a better product for our customers. In terms of in terms of short-haul railroads with \u2013 versus long-haul railroads with \u2013 in the operating ratio. Again, every railroad is slightly different. Every railroad has its nuances. Used to \u2013 we used to have some really, really, really nice long-haul routes across Western Canada back in the day when I used to work there. And it was very nice to ride along and take a look at the moose and some greenfields and a little bit of this, a little bit of that, go for a couple of thousand miles. But there weren't any customers. Here, we're like winding around and maybe got a little shorter haul, a little more challenges. And in \u2013 we're stopping all the time because we've got customers all over the place. So they come \u2013 it comes with what it is. This is \u2013 there's a lot of business activity in the east that we have the opportunity here to take advantage of. And that's a good thing. And another part of my history goes back to my days at the Chicago Northwestern when we built the line into the Powder River Basin coal fields subsidiary called Western Railroad properties, which is about 200 miles long, hit an operating ratio that started with a four handle. So every piece of \u2013 every railroad property is different. Every railroad property is unique. Our goal is to have the best quality product and do it in the most efficient way. And if we do those two things, the thing that happens is we make a lot of money doing it. Allison Landry : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Your line is open. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good afternoon. I wanted to see if you could give a sense about -- I think, Kevin, you said you're going to add headcount above the pace of attrition. I know there's a lead time to have T&Y, get them recruited and get them trained up and on the system. So I would assume you have pretty good visibility to what that number is. If you look at the next quarter or two and wanted to see if you could give us a sense is that sequentially 1% increase or 3%, or just kind of magnitude? Is it a big step up, or is it something that's pretty gradual and is that something we should think about in terms of our margin modeling in first half of the year, or is it just kind of small, so it doesn't really affect how you do with incrementals or margins? Kevin Boone : No. This is \u2013 and maybe I'll hand it over to Jamie to talk a little bit about his strategy and what he's really planning for here. But no, these aren't in order of magnitude, huge step-up in our hiring process. A lot of it to get ahead of the attrition rates that we see coming ahead in 2021. And really, I think we're pretty confident that, again, we're going to have the operating leverage that we've continued to deliver. So I wouldn't expect headcount to go up more than the volumes that we're going to see and the revenue increases, and we'll adjust the model accordingly as I think we have more visibility, hopefully, going forward on where volumes are trending. We've seen a lot of volatility in every market out there. And hopefully, the volatility starts to diminish here a bit as we move to the second half of the year. Jamie? Jim Foote : Yes, thanks. Look, if I was to look at percentages, when you think about it, our attrition rate is somewhere around 8% per year, so what we want to do is kind of front-load that attrition rate, keep a good eye on our discussions with Mark and his team to make sure we're ahead of that business that might be coming our way as we progress through the year, which then allows us to backfill the rest of that attrition towards the back end of the year. If the business doesn't come, we'll be in a situation where we can at least attrit out to the end of the year and go from there. So, as Jim said, it takes four to six months to make a conductor. So, we don't get ahead of this now and the business comes along, we're going to be leaving it on the ground, and that's the last thing we want to do. Tom Wadewitz : So, the headcount increases sequentially early in the year. And then if the business is in there, the attrition could kick in and it could fall back off. Is that essentially what you're saying? Jim Foote : Absolutely. That's how we're setting it up. Tom Wadewitz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Your line is open. Justin Long : Thanks and good afternoon. Wanted to ask about comp for employee. Kevin, any color you can provide on what you're expecting there over the course of 2021? And then maybe for Jamie, I was wondering if we could get an update on the number of locomotives in storage today and what you're anticipating for that utilization rate going forward? Kevin Boone : Yes, I'll take the comp per employee. Look, as I talked about in my opening remarks, we're going to see a little bit of more labor inflation this year. We'll see the management increase take effect here, January 1, which is a little bit different than what we've seen in previous years. So, that will be effective in the first quarter. But overall, I think historically, we talked about this 3% increase and without knowing what really incentive comp can move around quarter-to-quarter. All those things, I think a 3% kind of range is a good starting point. Jim Foote : And look, on the asset side, in particular, locomotives, we started this back in 2017 with almost 4,000 locomotives, our fleets down $21.50, I think, today, right around that area. So, we've got hundreds of locomotives still in storage ready to pull out when needed. But we're also continuing to invest in our locomotive fleet. I mean our CapEx coming up this year. We're going to continue to rebuild locomotives. We've got 67 in the plan this year, and continuing to do that as we go forward. It's really important that we continue to invest in the assets that we have. And that allows us to put trip optimizer, distributed power, fuel savings, as well as reliability. So, we're comfortable with the assets that we have now. We just want to continue to invest in rebuilding what we have going forward. Justin Long : Okay, great. Thanks for the time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Group : Hey, thanks afternoon guys. So, Kevin, any color you can give us on M S&O costs that you expect for the year? I know it's volatile, but any color there? And then on the OR, I know we're not getting guidance, but almost always the full year OR is better than fourth quarter. Is there anything wrong with that line of thinking right now? Kevin Boone : The first quarter, better than the fourth quarter. Scott Group : No. Meaning, if you look at a full year, it's almost always better than the fourth quarter you just had. And the fourth quarter\u2026 Kevin Boone : Yeah. Again, I think we gave relative revenue guidance because there is a little bit of uncertainty, I think, as you get into the second half, hopefully, some of these initiatives that Jim talked about will take hold and we'll see the economy strengthened through the back half of the year. I think we're real comfortable just saying that we're pretty confident in the incremental margins that we've been able to deliver, and we'll continue to do that, particularly if we get stronger revenue growth than we expect there. So that's the opportunity. On the MS&O, when you look at the fourth quarter, really, we're able to deliver what we thought we're going to do when we guided in the third quarter. Real estate sales going into 2021 will be flat, so not a real big factor or driver on those costs on a year-over-year basis. We do expect inflation to hit us in 2021 there. But again, it's an area where we have a lot of focus, and we'll continue to try to find opportunities to take out costs. So I think expect some normal inflation impact to that line item, but nothing real impactful there moving into 2021. It will move also with volume. So if volume is a little bit higher than what we expect. You would see some variable costs move up with that as well. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Your line is open. Chris Wetherbee : Yeah, hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess, one last question about service. We think about the second half of the year, obviously, service was a little bit more challenge still quite good, but down from where you were in the first half of the year, and when you think about sort of headcount and maybe resources. Is there a level, I guess, number one, on the service, or a level where you feel like you're comfortable or maybe you need to address it to move the needle-moving back up? And then second, when you think about maybe a little bit of the front-load from a headcount perspective, does that have an impact on the service, or would you expect that to have an impact on the services as you move into the first half of the year? Jim Foote : Yeah. Let me just make a general comment and then Jamie can answer you into details about where we are in terms of headcount. I think the railroads are not unique in the second half of the year. This phenomena with everyone trying to keep up with this unprecedented volume is creating issues whether it be in foreign ports, whether it be in ocean vessels, whether it be in the West Coast ports, the East Coast ports, the railroads, the trucks, logistics service providers, you name it. Everybody is dealing with a situation where volumes are unprecedented and volatile. At the same time, when we have hundreds, literally hundreds of employees are sick or in quarantine. In one day, it's on the west side of the railroad. The next day, it's on the east side of the rail. The next say, it's in the north side of the rail, next day it\u2019s in Florida. And so for us to be doing the job from a service standpoint right now, I don't think anybody is saying, they're having problems because the railroads are screwed up. We're doing a really, really, really good job of managing our way through this. And I'll let Jamie talk in some more detail about what it is we're doing. Jamie Foote :  I think, Jim, really nailed it with respect to some of the pockets we're seeing and why some of the levels aren't where they were historically. But you really look at some of the stuff that we have gained though as well. When you look at \u2013 to a 19% all-time record train length increase year-over-year, the fuel efficiency, everything else that we've been able to keep and maintain and continue to move forward as we talk about 2021. I can tell you today, as we see -- Jim said, hundreds and hundreds of employees are off, that's correct. And as we start to see 100 employees less, let's say, today than we were a few weeks ago, yes we're starting to feel that we're getting even more fluid. So as those numbers come down, we feel like we have the right number of people out there, if we -- if everyone returned to work. Now I wish, I could predict where the next pocket was going to be and try to send people that way, but it's difficult to do that. So yes, we're going to hit some bumps and bruises, I think, over the next quarter or so. On some of our service levels, but we are pushing. And is there a limit where we're happy? No, absolutely not. We've got -- if anyone wants to ask the question, is there anything left? What else are you going to continue to do, it's normally a question we get asked. Well, our dwell and velocity isn't where it needs to be. That's an opportunity. So as we continue to maintain all the hard work that we've done with the new plan, and the team that I've got out there working hard day in and day out on dwell and velocity and what's going on in the terminals, we're going to get that much better. And as business comes back and as we do some hiring, it helps us move the new commodities that we have come online. But really, what we have today is just a matter of dealing with the pockets that are out there. I can tell you, it is a daily exercise in trying to understand how some terminals we work around 40% of our employees being off on COVID. It doesn't just normally hit a small percentage. We do have it across the property. But we have some pockets where 40% of our employees are gone for a period of time. We've got a great team that moves into there, helps out. We work ourselves through it. We work around it, which is great about the network we have as we can do that, and continue to move the product. Look, we will see our numbers continue to improve as we move forward. But again, it's -- sometimes it's a daily exercise depending on where we're having our COVID issues. Scott Group : Got it. Thanks for the color guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Bascome Majors : Yes, good afternoon. Kevin, you talked about your excess cash balance and looking to normalize it overtime, is that something you're targeting for this year or could that be more gradual? Just any thoughts on how you want to manage your liquidity and balance sheet with the cash flow you expect to generate this year would be helpful? Thanks. Kevin Boone : Yes. I think, look, I would expect something lower by the time we exit this year. So yes, I think that's probably a this year event. We'll watch it closely here. Certainly, as we get more comfortable with the trajectory of the economy and those things, we'll have those discussions internally here on what makes sense. We always want to be opportunistic. So we'll be there opportunistically in the stock as well. So it gives us a lot of flexibility. We're going to generate a lot of cash this year as well. So it's a good position to be in. It's a position of strength. And we'll do the best we can. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Jamie, maybe I'll take you up on the dwell and velocity one. They have deteriorated for while here. Obviously, volumes have been quite volatile. They have longer trains to help offset that challenge. It doesn't seem to be a headwind financially now, but we've also seen cars online come up quite a bit. So maybe you can dig in a little bit deeper and give us a sense as to what has been the challenge outside of labor and what you see sort of the opportunities, maybe a time frame as to seeing some improvement. And then, Jimmy, if you can comment on the growth opportunities you're seeing for the truck conversion side. That doesn't sound like any of the service challenges now or in recent quarters are really affecting anything, but maybe if you can just clarify that for us as well, if the customers are just needing capacity and you have it, and it's really just tough out there for everybody. Jamie Boychuk : Okay. I'll try to take a stab at -- you're hard to hear, but let me try to work down with respect to where we're sitting with some of our metrics. So, yes, our dwell and our velocity definitely has been impacted here over the past couple -- probably, a couple of months, but we've seen probably more of a deterioration really over the past month, if you take a look at some of our numbers. And again, a lot of that's COVID related. But for us, it's really important to show that as an opportunity as well. As we continue to move things faster and we get our dwell to where we know it can be and will be. Those are costs that are going to continue to come out as we look at our plan. Cars online, our target, we're a little bit above where our target -- where we really want it to be. But you got to think, when we started this back in 2017, we were over 150,000 cars online. Now, we're somewhere around 100,000, maybe 120,000 depending on where you're looking at it. We have done some things differently on that. There was a time, I would say, a year ago where we were shooting for a 90% fill rate, because we didn't necessarily understand whether the fill rate was correct? Whether the customers were ordering and not ordering. Mark and his team have done an unbelievable job working with us to understand that, that fill rate now, pushing it to 100%, gives us that extra business that Jim has been talking about, about knocking on our customers' doors to say, hey, why are you trucking when you got rail service, give it to us and allow us that reliability. That means at some point, you're going to have to bring on some cars online, as you take a look at fulfilling 100% fill rate. So that's what we're pushing towards in our model. We're comfortable with that. We're keeping a good eye on what those cars look like as they move around. And if anything, the opportunity, as we look at the car fleet we have, now as we start picking up that velocity, we're going to get more loads out of those cars that are out there, which is more opportunity for us to be able to spin the customer cars. Some of the highest numbers that we have year-over-year are private cars. So that's an opportunity there for customers to spin their cars faster and give us four or five more loads a year as we get quicker. So, yes, it's opportunity, opportunity, opportunity as we move forward with the plan that we put in. Jim Foote : Yes. And by doing all those things correctly in a coordinated fashion between operations and sales and marketing, that's what's driving this business from the highway onto the rail. Brian Ossenbeck : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is open. David Vernon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So Jamie, I was wondering if you could kind of help us understand that rate of resource addition in relation to volume growth. I think you guys are laying out a picture that says somewhere in the mid-single digits on volume. And I'm not asking you to confirm that as a volume guide. I'm just trying to get a sense for, if we're going to be at that level of volume growth, what level of resource do you need to add into the network from today's levels to kind of keep pace with that at the service level you want to provide? Jamie Boychuk : Look, when we talk about hard assets with respect to locomotives, we're in a good spot. We're going to need to use some more locomotives as some volume starts to come back. Yes. When you look at bulk business, definitely, those are per train starts. When you look at our car fleet, I'm comfortable that as our dwell continues to come down as we move forward, we'll need less boxcars. But we're going to make sure that we hit that fulfillment rate of 100%, right? That's a 10% difference when you really think about 90% was a target a year-or-so ago. Now it's 100% as we move forward with our customers, showing the reliability of being there with the car supply we say we're going to be. Yes, you're going to see a bit of an increase. But where we're at right now is a good spot. As we move faster, as I mentioned, we'll get that many more loads out of the cars that are out there, which is going to help that growth as we continue to move forward. And I think we've really touched on the people side of things. Front-loading is the right thing to do. It gives us that four to six months to do that hiring practice and deal with the attrition that we see out there and prepare us for what's going to happen towards the second half. Jim Foote : Yes, David, the hiring is really offsetting the attrition that we expect through the full year. But really front-end loading that so we can get ahead of it and react to any volume upside that could occur in the second half. David Vernon : Yes. I'm just trying to point, do we need to be at this 2019 to \u2013 can we \u2013 could we accommodate a 5% volume growth with the current headcount level, or does it need to be a little bit higher than that? And what's the proportion of which the headcount would need to be added back? Kevin Boone : Well, I think a lot of this, I think, is going to give us the ability to hit the hot pockets where we were low on crews right now and it's really redistributing Jamie, correct me if I'm wrong, \u2013 redistributing a lot of the employees to where we were going to need and where we see the growth coming. Jamie Boychuk : Yes. It's based off of \u2013 obviously, we look at our attrition rate and where it's at and where we expect those employees to attrit out. But this is working very close with the marketing team. This is very \u2013 as Jim mentioned earlier, the closer that Mark and myself and our teams work together, we know and have an idea where this business growth is going to come from. Could it throw us a curveball? Sure, it could. But you want to \u2013 as it stands right now, we're preparing in those areas that we need to, and we're going to make sure that we hire in those \u2013 to make sure we can capture that growth. And look at cars online, really, when you look at year-over-year, the percentage is 12%. But really, we're down 4% full year versus prior full year. So we're not talking about a big percentage points here. And it's really important that we give the reliability of getting that box card to 100% fulfillment, if we want those customers convert over. David Vernon : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good evening everyone. Thanks for confirming the view on coal improving from the 2020 trough levels. I wanted to get your views on how much of that is anticipation of the domestic market versus the export market? And as it relates to the latter, we're seeing shortages in certain regions of the world because of the bitter winter weather and some trade issues. Have you seen any uptick in your export coal opportunities given some of those issues? Kevin Boone : Yes. I think when you look at our coal business; fourth quarter was -- showed a little bit of strength versus previous three. So, we're exiting the year at a little bit better position than what we saw, call it, the middle of the year here. Going into next year, probably the strength that we anticipate will really be on the domestic side with a little bit of the utility stockpiles below normal levels. So, we see some opportunity there. You see the same benchmark prices on the export side that we see. They stabilize, which is a good sign. They're still well below the levels that we saw pre-pandemic, whether that's an opportunity from here, we hope so. I think the risk/reward is probably a little bit more balanced than it has been in previous years or particularly coming into 2020. So, you're probably referencing the China, Australia, spat they have on the coal side right now, not helping the global prices right now and so not really helping us. So, hopefully, that gets resolved, and we'll see some maybe net price upside here going forward, but that's a very difficult market for us to predict. On the thermal side, if you look at our business today in the fourth quarter, really, that export business is 75% med and 25% thermal. If you get some of these polar vortex impacting some of the global markets and get a cold wave here. Maybe that's an opportunity because we're delivering very little to Europe and other areas today. So, we're going into the year cautiously optimistic. I don't see a huge upside case, but see a little bit of stability and strength off of the fourth quarter. Jon Chappell : Sounds great. Thanks Kevin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jordan Alliger : Yes hi. Just one quick question. To the extent you have it, do you have the -- your economic thoughts that sort of underpin the commentary you made on volume, in other words, volumes greater than GDP, merchandise greater than industrial production. What's your economic guys saying around those two measures? Kevin Boone : Well, as I said, there's -- there are a lot of different views on what the underlying number is going to be. And so right now, we're not -- we're trying to find what is the most reliable number for us to look at. And also at the same time, as you know, everybody is adjusting their numbers and to a large degree, from -- they're adjusting them down. So, our guys don't necessarily have -- our guys have a -- I'm sure they have -- they have an independent view, but it's not something that we're going to put out there as what we think right now is something that we're willing to bet the pharma, and so to speak, and how we're going to run the company. We're trying to look at all the different viewpoints and as we move further into 2021, hopefully, things get clearer and clearer for us as we progress. Jordan Alliger : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl from Cowen. Your line is open. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Hey, gentlemen, my best to Mark, hope he feels better. I wanted to talk a little bit about your trip plan compliance. It looks like things are going in the right direction on the carload side. Talk a little bit about what you guys are doing there to improve that? And then is there really anything that the railroad can do right now to materially move the intermodal trip plan compliance, or is this all just, sort of, congestion needs to work through some of the ports and some of the inland facilities? Jim Foote : Let me start with the look at the trip plans on the intermodal side. Look, we have -- we considered probably on both ends, the most stringent trip plans out there with respect to always making sure that we measure both loads and empties, whether that's intermodal or on the merchandise side. And I'd like to say our times are probably some of the most stringent times out there where, on the intermodal side, you're arriving to the minute. Over the past couple of months or a month or so, UPS peak was amazing. It was a big, big quarter. I don't think that's a surprise. And as we felt some pressure at different ports in different areas, we got the opportunity to move even more UPS traffic than we expected to. So some of our international traffic may have -- that isn't as time-sensitive, may have taken a little longer to get off the port than we normally would to make sure we move the time sensitive traffic. But going forward, I fully look at our numbers with respect to the intermodal side, 90% above is where we should be getting. I mean, we're shooting for above 95% on that, and I'm confident that our team is there. And we're starting to see some of those numbers hit already as we've moved past some of that UPS peak. On the carload side, again, you missed by two hours on the carload side, that's it. It's failed, whether it's a loader or empty, and our connections are tight from terminal to terminal. And if you have some of those COVID pockets, we're 40% of your terminals off, and it takes you an extra six or eight or 10 hours to get a car to a terminal, that\u2019s a failure. We're not willing to change our standards and our metrics with respect to where they sit to getting to that last mile. So we're going to work through this, which we have. We've seen some improvement on the numbers. Not as quick as I would like to see some of those continue to move forward. But we do have the best metrics with respect to those who look at trip plans out there today. So we're confident that moving forward, we're going to see that number get up into the 80s. And our target will continue to be to push forward with that, which will allow that reliability for Mark and his team to go up there and continue to sell this product that we've built. Jason Seidl : That's great color, and I'm glad to hear things are moving in the right direction on the numbers, and everyone be safe out there. Appreciate the time as always. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good evening, everyone. So just to, kind of, wind up here, the -- am I expecting a bit of a tone shift from the OR here. I think over time, you guys have, kind of, clearly mentioned that you are going to be pursuing growth to a great extent going forward. But kind of as we think of that 3 to 5 year or algorithm going forward, again, you're starting to sound a little bit more like the Canadian rails who are saying, hey, we're going to -- OR is not the only thing as a standalone, we're going to be looking at growth and growing EBIT dollars here. So are you targeting sticking to a high 50s OR, but pushing the top line much higher from here? Jamie Foote : Well, we -- again, we've never said that we are singularly focused on one thing only, and that's trying to get the operating ratio down. And just in simplistic terms, if you want at a 50 operating ratio, we'd have a 50 operating ratio. We do it like quickly. I'm not sure what would be left to the company in the process.  But \u2013 so it's always a balance between trying to do things as efficiently as you possibly can. While you're delivering a good product to the customer, so you can grow the business. And that's always from day one, since I walked in the door here being the plan. And it just takes a while to get the railroad to run right because you can start to be able to generate some new business. So the algorithm going forward is the algorithm that we've had in place for the last 3 going on 4 years, focused on delivering a really high-quality, good, reliable product to the customer, which allows you to get more business. And if you do that, you drive a whole bunch of unnecessary costs out of the company and you increase efficiency. When you do that, you make a lot of money and you make a lot of money, shareholders are happy. That's our simple business plan. Ravi Shanker : Great. And maybe as a quick follow-up. We have a new administration this morning. Are there any kind of 2 or 3 things you're looking for from DC something you're watching out for either as a tailwind or a headwind? Jamie Foote : Government stability that too much to ask for. I would be \u2013 that would be a good start. So let's give them a couple of weeks to figure out whether or not we're going to have debt, and then we can start figuring out, if there's any significant real change in anybody's agenda. We're used to working with not only on the federal level. But we operate in 22, 23 states. Some of them are led by a Democratic Governor and some are led by a Republican Governor. So we're used to dealing with all kinds of philosophies in viewpoints as it relates to government relations with business. And so, it's not new to us. We'll just figure out what to do and how to interact, and then we'll get along fine with everybody. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Walter Spracklin : Well, thanks so much. Hi, good evening. Just to follow-up on that question with regards to Washington. And looking back, a swing in favor, swing of power in favor of the Democrat has not been a good thing from a railroad regulatory standpoint. And now that your ORs are trending where they are, Jim, do you see any risk that regulators start to put close attention on the returns you're getting now and introduce new risk of changes or more leniency or favoritism towards the customer here? Jamie Foote : No, not necessarily. I mean, again, there's a mix -- there's a remix. There's a mix on the STB that goes back and forth in terms of whether it's -- now, I guess it's two-three versus what it was before, maybe two-three, versus maybe what it was at one point in time. So, again, this is something we're always dealing with. We're not unique in the sense that we're a regulated -- or we have a regulator. And so, it's not like every airline railroad, telephone company, TV company, you name it, anybody that's got a regulator, all of a sudden is worried about the end of days. We just adapt, and we figure out what it is their concerns are. And we work appropriately with them. And we've been doing this for a couple of hundred years and doing it successfully. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Understood. And if I could, just a clarification question for Kevin here. On the question of yield, I know you answered that kind of on a segmented basis. If I lump it all together, am I right in interpreting what you said, that yield is going to be negative in the early part of the year and possibly turn positive in the back half. Is that the right way to look at yield? Because it's been so negative this year, it will obviously have a pretty big impact, depending on which direction we go on the magnitude of the yield here. Kevin Boone : Yes. Like I said, the revenue -- or the fuel surcharge will be a headwind in the first quarter. That will weigh on the yield similarly to what we saw in the fourth quarter here. That will moderate in the second quarter and then I think you'll see some improvement. I always have to caveat it with mix matters, right? And depending on what markets, hopefully, the strong markets, like our chemical business and others, continue to have some upside, and that will obviously be a huge impact to our yield performance. If the coal export market strengthens, as you know, our contracts are structured to participate in the commodity prices, if they strengthen. So that would be also an opportunity for us into the back half of the year. Offsetting that, I think, we are still very bullish on, as you heard us talk about on the intermodal side, it's a really good business for us. It happens to have a lower RPU, but we make good money there. And so we would -- Jamie is ready to handle more growth there, and we have a great team going after more opportunities. So, although, it's equal, where we see it today, which will change probably tomorrow. Yes, a little bit of headwind in the first quarter, probably strengthening into the back half of the year. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Ross from Stifel. Your line is open. David Ross : Thank you. Love the enthusiasm, operator. Kevin, I wanted to follow-up on your last comment there about intermodal, specifically related to intermodal pricing. Is the expectation for better than normal intermodal pricing, given what's going on in the truckload market, or is it going to be more of a cost recovery, low single-digit type yield improvement story? Kevin Boone : Well, we don't see real-time -- some of our partners see in terms of price. We'll generally see a lag there. There's also inflation adjusters that occur, they want a lag basis as well. So, again, it kind of fits with my commentary around probably second half, hopefully showing some improvement over the first half. Unfortunately, in strong markets, we don't get to reprice our entire book of business. Today, these things happen over time. We'll need the markets to remain strong and supportive. And so that yes, I think we're somewhat optimistic, but there's a lot of \u2013 time will tell. What happens going forward, if the economy can strengthen in the back half of the year that certainly will help the discussions our sales and marketing team are having. So they're out there selling the business hard right now. David Ross : Good. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session and concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q1 2021 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Bill Slater, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Bill Slater : Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Chief Financial Officer; and Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations. On slide two is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on slide three. With that, it's my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim Foote : Great. Thanks so much Bill and welcome to everyone joining us on today's call. I want to begin by thanking all of CSX's railroaders for the hard work and the exceptional efforts they've made to keep the yards open and the terminals open to serve our customers throughout the severe weather we experienced this quarter, an amazing job. We entered this year cautiously optimistic about the potential for an improving economic environment, and I am pleased to see momentum steadily building over the last few months. Throughout the quarter, we remained focused on laying the foundations to prepare for growth, and I'm excited about our prospects for the rest of the year. It's nice to finally have an economic tailwind at our backs. Let's begin with slide five of the presentation for an overview of our first quarter financial results. Earnings per share decreased 7% to $0.93, and the first quarter operating ratio increased to 60.9%, reflecting a spike in COVID cases early in the quarter, winter storm impacts, and fuel surcharge timing lag. Turning to slide six, revenue declined 1% on 1% volume growth as intermodal and other revenue growth was more than offset by merchandise, coal, and fuel surcharge revenue declines. Merchandise revenue declined 6% led by declines in automotive and energy-related shipments within the chemicals and minerals segments. These declines were partially offset by growth in the metals and fertilizers businesses. Intermodal revenue grew 11%, reaching new first quarter record levels. This growth was driven by strong demand for transportation services due to continued inventory replenishments and growth from East Coast ports. Coal revenue decreased 5%. Domestic coal revenue increased due to growth in utility coal shipments. This growth was more than offset by declines in export coal, primarily from reduced international shipments of thermal coal. Other revenue increased 42%. The largest driver of this increase was higher revenue from storage at intermodal facilities. Turning to slide seven, we remain committed to being the safest railroad. With fewer recent COVID cases across the network, we are able to increase the number of in-person interactions and training sessions. We resumed hosting safety summits across the network and are even expanding these summits to cover additional crafts beyond our T&E workforce. Our top concern is eliminating life-changing events, and through increased engagement on critical rules compliance, we\u2019ve seen a reduction in injury severity to start the year. Continued education and training will allow us to further reduce the total number of injuries by working with both managers and frontline employees on how to identify and eliminate unsafe behavior across the railroad. Additionally, we're finding new ways to improve safety through the increased use of technology. We are increasing drone usage to help ensure the safe movement of trains throughout our yards and are already seeing the benefits of this program in the positive train accident trends. We will look to expand these programs going forward as part of our ongoing efforts to identify and implement new tools to help us operate as safely as possible. On slide eight, let's review our operating performance for the quarter. Despite challenging conditions, the team did a good job of maintaining network fluidity throughout the quarter. Going forward, we are focused on driving velocity and dwell back to pre-pandemic records, and we expect to see improvement in both metrics throughout the year. We also remained focused on driving additional efficiencies across the network. We set a new record for distributed powertrains, averaging over 100 trains a day for the first time. Labor productivity also reached a new record. Even though we are adding headcount in the second quarter in preparation for the expected volume growth, we still plan to realize incremental labor productivity this year. Turning to slide nine. I wanted to take the opportunity to frame these recent operating metrics against where we started this transformation. Over this period, we have increased velocity more than 30% by reducing both line of road congestion and creating excess capacity within yards to limit how long fluid train sit idle. While dwell has also improved over this period, we view this metric as an area of opportunity. Even though CSX is currently -- has the lowest dwell in the industry, pushing this number back towards previous record levels will enable us to further reduce cars online and improve asset utilization. It is most important to note that this increased fluidity was enabled by redesigning the train plan to operate as a more balanced and efficient network. We are doing the same amount of work today with 1,500 fewer locomotives and dramatically improved locomotive utilization. These efforts have also driven significant improvements in fuel efficiency. Not only are we more fuel efficient, but we have retired older, less efficient locomotives and increased the use of distributed power and trip optimizer technologies to further expand the emission savings we offer our customers. Our train plant also greatly improves our crew productivity. One measure of this productivity is the total number of dead heads or the times we have -- or the times where we have to reposition crews using taxis or other vehicles because there isn't a return locomotive. The balanced plan reduced the number of dead heads almost 60% by better matching crews and locomotives in both directions. We have also increased the number of cars processed per hour worked by over 30%. This higher throughput is due to both a reduction in yard congestion, as well as, more strategic upstream blocking of cars. Anyway you look at the data, we have dramatically transformed how CSX operates, which has created the capacity to absorb significant growth for years to come. We remain focused on driving the network back to record performance levels as well as realizing the incremental efficiency benefits this will provide. Turning to Slide 10. I want to be clear that we are not done improving our network. The opportunities identified during the early stages of the pandemic last year continued to drive sustained efficiency improvements and the more streamlined network is well positioned for growth. While this quarter's trip plan performance was negatively impacted by the winter storms and COVID-related absences, intermodal trip plan performance will still improve -- was still improved for the quarter and is currently running nearly 90%. We expect to see similar improvement trends for the carload business going forward. We are committed to providing our customers with an industry-leading service product and are proactively adding headcount and prepositioning locomotives across the network to ensure, we are prepared to provide high-quality service while handling incremental volumes. I'll now let Kevin take us through the financials. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. The team is encouraged by the positive economic momentum. Underlying demand is growing, truckload capacity is tight and inventory levels are low. We are preparing the network for growth and focused on driving positive operating leverage. As Jim noted, we faced a challenging environment in the first quarter with winter storms and supply chain disruptions, creating headwinds both operationally and commercially. Looking at the first quarter income statement on Slide 11. Revenue was down 1%, despite a 1% increase in carloads. Double-digit gains in our intermodal business were offset by lower fuel recovery and declines across several merchandise markets. Other revenue was also up significantly, primarily reflecting increased intermodal storage fees. For the year, we expect other revenue of approximately $500 million. This assumes intermodal storage fees returned to more normalized levels. Total expenses increased 2% in the quarter. Walking down the expense line items, labor and fringe was up 2%, driven by higher incentive compensation as well as inflation and other costs. The year-over-year increase in incentive compensation was largely due to our annual bonus program accrual as we lap the impact of the pandemic. Our long-term incentive comp costs also increased year-over-year as our growth outlook has continued to improve. Sequentially, we expect incentive comp in the second quarter to remain relatively flat based on our current outlook. Partially offsetting these headwinds, efficiency gains remain strong as T&E employee productivity was up nearly 10% and train length increased 13% to a first quarter record. Total headcount was down 7%, reflecting structural improvements made over the last year. On a sequential basis, headcount was roughly flat, as increased T&E hiring was offset by improved labor productivity. Consolidation in our train plan has enabled a 23% reduction in locomotive maintenance headcount versus the prior year. We've also continued to drive efficiencies and yard support headcount, both through ongoing consolidation as well as technology. As you know, we are highly focused on ensuring we have adequate resources positioned to serve customer demand in a rebounding economy. We are actively recruiting and running important conductor training classes and as a result, headcount should increase slightly going forward. MS&O expense increased 2% or $15 million in the first quarter driven by a $15 million headwind from lower real estate gains, while efficiency gains were offset by inflation and other items. As we run a tighter trading plan, asset related efficiency gains continue to headline MS&O savings. Despite weather related headwinds and some proactive actions to pull assets out of storage in anticipation of higher demand, locomotive and terminal, productivity levels continue to achieve record highs. Real estate gains were minimal in the first quarter. However, as you likely saw last week, we announced the closing of an agreement with Virginia to sell certain interest in CSX-owned line segments. This project will generate meaningful value for CSX and enhance the safety and reliability of both passenger and freight rail service in the D.C. and Virginia area. The transaction will result in a significant gain of approximately $350 million in the second quarter this year. Cash proceeds of $525 million will be realized over time with approximately $400 million expected in 2021. Turning now to fuel expense, which was $2 million favorable year-over-year. Record first quarter efficiency helped offset the impact of a 4% increase in the per gallon price. We continue to invest in technologies that will deliver further improvement in fuel efficiency. Widening the advantage that rails hold over truck and demonstrating our continue commitment to sustainability. Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $1 million in the quarter, due to a larger asset base, partially offset by the 2020 road and track depreciation study, reflecting these effects going forward, we expect full year depreciation expense to increase approximately $20 million. Equipment rent expense increased $7 million or 9% as network fluidity impacted car cycle times in the quarter. Turning below the line. Interest expense improved $3 million or 2% due to a lower weighted average coupon. Other income decreased $2 million or 9% as favorable pension impacts were offset by lower interest on cash. Income tax expense decreased $12 million, or 5%, due to lower pretax income. The average tax rate increased slightly to 24.7% due to an unfavorable state legislative change. Closing out the income statement, CSX delivered operating income of $1.1 billion and a 60.9% operating ratio. Turning to the cash flow slide on 13. On the first quarter, free cash flow before dividends was $934 million, up 15% when compared to the first quarter of 2020. Free cash flow conversion on net income exceeded 100%. Finally, as you can see from the chart on the right, shareholder distributions rebounded in the quarter. Share repurchase activity returned to prior year levels, and the recent dividend increase is also reflected. We expect to continue to be opportunistic in our buyback approach going forward, and we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Foote : Great, Kevin. Thanks a lot. Concluding with slide 15, we entered the year projecting volume growth in excess of GDP and still expect to achieve this target. We will continue to attract demand throughout the year and based on the combination of the strengthening economic outlook and our focus on converting additional volumes off the highway, we now expect to achieve double-digit full year revenue growth. We will drive incremental operating leverage by efficiently absorbing this growth, and we'll diligently monitor our train plan to address resources as needed to provide our customers with high-quality service. Our entire company is aligned to capture this growth opportunity. And as always, our focus is first and foremost on our customers and finding creative ways to help customers meet their own growth targets this year. Now, is the time to capitalize all the work we have done to transform our network. Thank you. And now I'll turn it back to Bill for questions. And as you may have noted, Mark is unable to join the call again today. He continues to deal with a non-COVID personal health issue, but remains engaged in the business. The rest of the team will do the best to answer any marketing questions you may have. Bill Slater : Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time, I would ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question. With that, we will now take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have our first question coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ken Hoexter : Jim, can you talk about the pace of growth and the employee ramp-up as you need -- you talked about the hiring in advance? And maybe the pace of expenses we should expect as we see that ramp up versus the revenue recognition as we move through the second half -- in the second quarter? Jim Foote : Great, Ken. Good question, and I'll ask Jamie or Kevin to add a little clarity as well. But generally, and you well know how long it takes for us to hire. So, we've been at this since the beginning of the year and have been running people through their classes, which we couldn't do before because of the social distancing issues. And so, we've been running people through the classes and now getting them out into the field, and they're starting to come out. And while we're reasonably well positioned, our numbers clearly have been impacted in the -- were impacted in the first quarter, because we were struggling in certain areas across the railroad because of crude challenges. These people are becoming -- are coming on now and will be coming on throughout the second quarter at regular intervals, as we, again, expect to see volume growth continue to increase now into the second and third quarter. Jamie, do you want to give some more detail? Jamie Boychuk : Yes. No, absolutely. Ken, we're -- what we're seeing right now is, every week, as it stands, about 10 or 12 employees on the network that are qualifying as conductors, but we've really bumped up our classes. As Jim has mentioned, just over the past couple of months, we're training anywhere from 60 to 90 new conductors depending on the month, every two weeks, there's a new course, making sure that we follow all the protocol with those required within this COVID environment. And really, we're positioning the employees in areas where we need them. We still have furloughed employees around the company that aren't willing to leave the locations where they're at. And in our industry, when we hire somebody, you hire them for a certain location. You offer transfers, moves, temporary or permanent, but it's up to the employee to make those decisions. So we will continue to hire, as we said last quarter, 400, 500 folks here throughout the year. But really, we're going to hit that, I would say, as we enter into the second half. And we'll continue to hire if we see the business levels come to the point that we think they will, and we'll just keep adding those resources. So we've got a great position that really puts us in that spot where we're looking at growth. Kevin Boone : Hey, Ken, the only other thing I would add is, while we're going to add some employees that we saw over time at a quite high level in the first quarter, and we would expect that number to come down over time as a hiring, so largely offsetting some of the incremental costs there. Ken Hoexter : So, offsetting some of the incremental cost per employee? Kevin Boone : Yes. Ken Hoexter : Or is that incentive comp? Okay. Kevin Boone : That's right. You'll probably see the highest quarter in terms of cost per employee this quarter. Ken Hoexter : Great. Appreciate the insight. Jamie Boychuk : Some of that's definitely related towards winter weather, though, in this quarter. It was a very difficult quarter, as Jim had mentioned here with the polar vortex and the rest of it. So, you're going to see those numbers come down. Ken Hoexter : Great. Thanks for the insight guys. Appreciate it. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Allison Landry with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open. Allison Landry : Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the service metrics. I mean obviously, you had the challenges of weather in Q1 and supply chains are quite clearly still in disarray. But Jim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you're expecting to get back to pre-COVID levels and record levels. How long do you think it will be before you guys can start to see some second derivative improvement, at least in the velocity numbers and dwell? And do you think that with demand increasing and strengthening, that it's going to take a few quarters? Just help us think through that. Thank you. Jim Foote : In the intermodal area, as I said, we are back to our best industry-leading performance, I think, in terms of intermodal, in terms of our velocity is already up, but again what we look at very closely is the trip plan compliance number, which takes everything into consideration. It doesn't do any good if you get to train across at a super high speed and then it sits at the terminal and can't get yard and you can't get the box off and the customer doesn't get it when he needs it. So, everything has to come together, and that's what's reflected in this trip plan number. And in intermodal, there's zero cushion. It's not like, yes, we met the trip plan, but give or take a couple of hours. In intermodal, it\u2019s zero time. So, we're back into the 90, 90-plus on-time performance in our trip plans in intermodal today, which is we were doing a little bit better than that a year ago in January, late the year before. And I expect that number to continue to creep up quickly in the second quarter if we catch a break and don't have some other kind of crazy weather events or something else. And then in the carload business, where -- again, our numbers are in this kind of mid-60% on-time -- the trip plan performance range, and that relates to about 30% a couple of years ago. And we want to get that number back into the mid-80% range where it was, and my challenge there is to Jamie is to get it done sooner than later. I'd like to see our velocity and dwell numbers get back to where they were kind of by the end of the second quarter, if possible. And then the trip plan numbers will start to come together as the year progresses. That puts the operating guys under a lot of pressure and -- but again, we're just getting back to where we are because once we're back to where we were, we're going to get better from there. Allison Landry : Thank you. That is helpful. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is open. Justin Long : Thanks and good afternoon. So I wanted to ask about the OR. In the first quarter, I think intra-quarter, you talked about 100 basis points worse kind of year-over-year with your expectation late in the quarter? Just curious what changed, if anything in March relative to the reported number? And then going forward, the revenue guidance is very helpful, but anything you'd be willing to share on incremental margin targets as we look out over the rest of the year? Jamie Boychuk : Yes. In terms of the quarter, late in the quarter, we probably experienced a little bit more fuel surcharge lag than we were expecting late in that quarter. Also, probably a little bit of after effects of the weather kind of creeped into the last couple of weeks of March as well. And then finally, as we saw the prospects for additional volume acceleration in the back half and even into the second quarter, Jamie was proactive in pulling out assets to get ready for that volume. So we saw probably a little bit extra cost there, which we thought was the right thing to do given everything we're seeing out there. So that's probably the difference between what Jim talked about at the conference and what we ultimately saw this quarter. A lot of moving parts this quarter, obviously, with the impacts of the winter storms and then the revenue. Quite frankly after January, we were looking at a very, very good quarter. And then obviously, February hit us hard, and March was digging ourselves out of it. In terms of incremental margins, look, as we've said last quarter and the previous quarters, as we get volume growth and revenue growth, we anticipate dropping that through at a positive incremental margins. So it will matter the pace of growth that we see. And if we continue to beat our expectations, I would expect OR to continue to beat our current estimates as well. So it's somewhat dependent on the strength of the revenue growth this year, which we obviously expect some strong performance. And if it continues to get better, you'll see the leverage in the model as well. Justin Long : Okay, great. I appreciate the time. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is open. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good afternoon. Jim, I wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on perhaps your first quarter earnings is compelling, but there was another topic earlier today, you probably noticed. What might be the impact to you guys from a Canadian railroad buying KSU? Is it -- does that matter much? I mean, I don't think you've interchanged a lot of traffic with KSU, but how would we think about that? And I don't know if you have any broader thoughts on whether that potentially could be a catalyst for a greater focus in the industry on bigger consolidation? Thank you. Jim Foote : Well, we've certainly looked at -- thanks, Tom. We certainly had an opportunity now over the, my guess is the last month or whatever it's been to kind of have a understanding of the CP proposal. We've had a manner of hours to absorb the CN proposal. And other than what we've, kind of, filed with the regulator concern -- expressing our thoughts on the -- so far, just on the procedural aspects of the CP transaction. I'm going to have to reserve comment about what I think in particular to either one of those transactions, until I had a time to see what they put forth and see what we think the impacts of whatever they put forth to the regulator in terms of why they think their transaction is a good deal. You've known me for a long time, Tom, I've been around this industry forever now. It seems like and started out in the days when the industry was, some would say, collapsed, if not near bankruptcy facing the prospects of nationalization. And over that period of time, since deregulation, the industry has transformed itself back into a strong vibrant industry, and most of that would be associated or attributed to the consolidations that have happened and the efficiencies that have come from that and the dramatic reinvestment and service improvement that has come to the industry as a result of those consolidations, all of which were approved by regulators to make sure that they were in the public interest and good for the customers. So, I have a view of what I think is -- if it's good for the customer, if it improves the quality of service for the customer, and it's in the public interest, I'm clearly say, hey, let's take a look at it and figure out what it all means. But in all circumstances, the devil is in the details of any transaction. And so until I get an opportunity to review any proposals, but I just have to reserve comment on the transactions themselves. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. But it sounds like you think it can be a constructive thing for the industry just in terms of being open to consolidation. Jim Foote : As I said, I think it's been a tremendous benefit to the shipping community, what's taken place to transform the North American rail network. Tom Wadewitz : Great. Okay. Thank you, Jim. I appreciate it. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Brandon Oglenski : Yes, thank you for taking my question. I guess, Jim, I want to stay on that subject. I mean, strategically, I guess we've heard a lot of negativity, though, about the next wave of 'Class I mergers' if there ever is to be on ex-KSU, but thinking more about potential transcontinental tie-ups. I mean we've heard a lot of the negative input from certain groups when other deals have been tried unsuccessfully. But I guess we haven't talked about a lot of the potential benefits. I mean do you view strategically as that is the path forward for the industry looking out 10 or 15 years. Jim Foote : No, I can't speculate on what's going to happen 10 or 15 years. I'm trying to figure out what happened 10 or 15 hours ago. So, as I said, there's been -- I think that, in my opinion, it has been the transformation of the North American rail network into what it is today has been a positive for the shipping community. And I think that's the key thing that the regulators look at, and I'm sure the regulators are going to do another thorough review of this transaction and see what happens. Brandon Oglenski : All right. Thank you. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Afternoon guys. So, a couple of small ones for -- Kevin, can you just -- yields have been negative the last few quarters. How should we think about the direction of yields and pricing going forward? And then you guys have $3 billion of cash, another $400 million coming in and generating cash flow. Is there a potential for accelerated buyback or do you think this is the right pace going forward. Kevin Boone : Yes. As I mentioned on the buyback specifically, we will definitely be opportunistic if there's opportunities to accelerate that. And you could expect, given the visibility going forward that we'll be much more aggressive in that area, given the opportunity. So we have some flexibility in that. Clearly, as I've said, $3 billion of cash is not something that we're looking in a long term to keep on the balance sheet, and we'll move away from that. Second part of that question was, again? Scott Group : Just the pricing momentum and yields have been negative, when you think we get to positive, how should we think about that? Kevin Boone : Yes. We're going to lap -- on the fuel surcharge, we'll lap that headwind this quarter. So we'll start -- we'll see that, kind of, tick away starting in the second quarter. We'll see some positive RPU growth, as you guys look at it, starting second quarter. Coal will be more favorable as we lap easier comps from last year, really across the group. I will say, we were looking at this yesterday, is pricing renewals are above our average price. So we are seeing some acceleration there, which is good and would be expected in a tight trucking environment. And we're really looking ahead to more inflation potentially. So those are discussions that we'll continue to have with the customer. But I would expect the pricing environment to improve. Scott Group : Thank you. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Your line is open. Chris Wetherbee : Yes. Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe kind of sticking on the revenue opportunity for a moment. When you think about volume for this year, I guess, I'm trying to hoping maybe you can get a little bit more specific when you're thinking about -- I know you pegged the, sort of, GDP clause. But if you could give us maybe some parameters, after we've seen sort of the toughest comp quarter out of the way? Obviously, we've gotten through the weather. We know, so the run rate of opportunity is now. It sounds like maybe there's upside from a revenue standpoint coming from both volume and price, but I don't know if you can kind of break those two apart for us a little bit and give us a little bit of sense of what you really see for the volume opportunity for you guys for the full year. Kevin Boone : Well, we gave a revenue number. I don't know if we're going to parse it down into specific volume. I think you can assume that both, when we move into the back half of the year, will be -- start to be positive and more positive, certainly, in the second half of the year when you think about RPUs, just based on some of the comps that we're lapping from prior year. So, clearly, second quarter volume will accelerate significantly, given the COVID impact. Third quarter, you're kind of lapping some COVID impact as well. In fourth quarter, we started to see some recovery, particularly in the intermodal business. So from a pace, I would expect, obviously, second quarter to be the highest growth quarter. Third quarter probably follows that and then in the fourth quarter, it's probably a little bit more up in the air. We'll see how much the economy continues to accelerate from here. But the easiest comp is the second quarter, second easiest is probably third quarter. And -- but we still expect second half growth to be pretty robust from where we see it today. Chris Wetherbee : And just maybe one point of clarification, since the last time we spoke three months ago, sort of the incremental upside, do you feel like it's coming a little bit more from volume or price, or a little bit of both? I guess, that's kind of what I was getting at. Kevin Boone : I mean, clearly, volume will be, just based on what we saw last year, will be the bigger component of our revenue growth for the year, this year. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Kevin, I wanted to follow up on the incremental margin question. I certainly, hope incremental margins will be positive as revenue turns positive -- revenue growth turns positive. But we're talking about -- you guys are talking about feeling better about volumes. You just said pricing is better than kind of typical renewals. So you've been pretty specific in the past in terms of giving specific OR targets? I think, I'm not asking you to do that, but if you just look at the way your cost structure has evolved, it would imply 60% to 70% incremental margins, just all else equal, just based on the variable and fixed nature of your costs and pricing is getting better. So unless, I'm missing something, like why shouldn't incremental margins be 60%, 70% or better than that in the context of revenue growth, volume growth and pricing growth? Kevin Boone : Yes. I mean, first of all, as I was explaining before, I think the magnitude of the revenue growth is a factor here, right? The more revenue growth that we potentially project here, the better the incremental margins. That's just basic math on that side. So we are very positive on the outlook. Well, as the network improves, that will drop through. And I don't think anything has changed from what we saw in the first quarter, what we said for the full year in terms of our ability to convert revenue into margin -- into operating income. We're not going to probably get in the game of getting a point target because things are still fluid from a revenue perspective, another point or two in revenue growth above and beyond what we have expect today. We'll see more benefit to where we ultimately land on the OR, so.. Amit Mehrotra : Right. And maybe a better way to ask that question then, Kevin, if I could. I think you're talking about just the fact that you have regular weight inflation that doesn't make incremental margins linear as revenues come on, if I'm interpreting your comments correctly? So, is it right way to think about regular weight inflation kind of 2%, 3% off of your current OpEx base? And as revenue grows in excess of that, that will do much more significantly drop to the bottom line? Just help us think through the philosophy around what you're seeing. Kevin Boone : Yes, that's exactly right. There's fixed cost inflation that you have to offset every year, particularly on the labor side. And then we're probably seeing -- although inflation remains low on the material side, seeing some signs of that ticking up as well. So, once you offset all of the inflation with further growth, then you'll see a more meaningful impact of the next point of growth above and beyond that -- Amit Mehrotra : And is that $200 million to $300 million a year as kind of that threshold point? Or is it less or more than that? Kevin Boone : We're looking at about 3% overall inflation across our cost structure. Amit Mehrotra : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Fadi Chamoun : Thank you. Jim, I just want to kind of circle back on the M&A topic a little bit. So I mean, we're kind of seeing the merits of kind of end-to-end mergers being outlined out there, like from a shipper's perspective, improving the capacity, improving the service, potentially improving the cost for the carrier as well. Why wouldn't that kind of scenario apply to East West merger? It feels like when it comes to TransCon mergers, there's always this idea that they're anti-competitive mergers. And I'm just trying to reconcile, why would that be the case, within the supply kind of the same logic, if we put aside all dwell\u2019s new rules and all that kind of debate aside? Wouldn't, technically speaking, these end-to-end merger provide the same kind of benefit that we would see in these other proposed transactions? Jim Foote : Well, certainly, there's an ongoing dialogue right now about the merits of end-to-end transactions. And historically speaking, railroad consolidations that were viewed as end-to-end and didn't reduce competition, or did not reduce optionality to the shipping community were viewed as -- viewed favorably. And I don't know that there has been any change in philosophy on that point. So like I said, we'll all see how this begins to play out. We're in the early stages as everyone keeps being reminded of a long process, in some cases, maybe a month, and in some cases hours. So we'll see how it unfolds. But again, the overreaching, overriding principles, I think, are applicable today. Fadi Chamoun : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to come back to truckload conversion. Jim, you mentioned your 90-plus-percent compliance with the intermodal trip plan with basically zero cushion. It sounds like that's pretty truck like service. If -- are you seeing a material impact of the service on conversions? If not, what's left to really get more shippers over the line? And then when we think about making this longer term conversions. How are you trying to make these stickier rather than someone looking for capacity in a tight market? How do you make these conversions really longer term and beneficial for both parties? Jim Foote : Well, yes, in the intermodal business, yes, I mean we're setting records in terms of our volumes. And this is -- that's after a couple of years earlier of reengineering the intermodal network, and which positioned us to be a bigger participant in this transformation to the e-commerce business model that so many people are adopting. So because we fixed the railroad, because we improved the service and because we've done all these things, we're able to participate in this where I don't think we would have been able to do that so effectively in the past and it shows in our numbers. And I don't see that changing. If people want to move more boxes and buy more things online, we want to be more and more and more involved in that supply chain. And we'll continue to work in that area to the best that we can. The other area where we\u2019re constantly focusing on truck conversions is in the merchandise side of the business. And that's taking metals and plastics and steel and cardboard and you name it, that today, we move in a boxcar, and the same shipper and the same plant in many circumstances is load and truck out the other side of their production facility. And that just takes us more and more time of getting involved, working with the customer. And we continue to see -- we continue to win business in those areas. And again, that's because our service equivalent to what they're getting in a truck. And so we have to get back to where we were in terms of -- and that's reliability is trip plan compliance. We have to get back to where we were and then get even better. And the better we get in that area and the more focused we are and that will continue to grow that -- those conversion opportunities as well. Brian Ossenbeck : And just to clarify, has the sales cycle sped up on this? Are you finding shippers and customers more agreeable to have these conversations to the extent you can separate that from service improvements versus just being tied on capacity across the freight network in general? Jim Foote : Conversations in those areas are, yes. We're becoming more and more relevant in the supply chain. We're becoming recognized as being more reliable. And a lot of other factors are aligning as well is bigger -- our bigger customers want to do more and more things to become more environmentally friendly, we can help them with the reduction in our carbon footprint, so ESG plays in our favor, fuel efficiency plays in our favor. All of this, our willingness to do things differently than the way we have done it in the past are -- we're showing good results. Brian Ossenbeck : All right. Thank you, Jim. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Bascome Majors : Jim, I understand your reluctance to comment on transactions that happen to be been filed for approval yet. But you did mention that you have commented publicly on the procedural issue at stake here with the SDB. And I thought it was notable that CSX was the only Class I rail that suggested the waiver of the 2001 rules does stand up for KSU or ask that it did. Can you give us a little more information or context on that and why you look at that differently than, say, your competitors? Jim Foote : Well, maybe to one -- in one -- it started with the proposed CN/BN merger. And I just happen to be sitting in the room when it was put on hold and a moratorium was put in place and all these rules fell into place. So, I have some sort of knowledge about how and why those rules were changed. And at that point in time, the ruling body felt that the -- an acquisition of the KCS didn't merit some speculative array of new ideas before they would approve it. And the regulatory body has had 20-some-years to change the rules that they wanted to change the rules and they didn\u2019t. So along comes a transaction and I kind of view the law is the law. And that's what we said. We don't see any circumstances that would merit a change from what was decided back in the day for the reasons it was decided. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Jonathan Chappell. Your line is open. Jonathan Chappell : Thank you. Good afternoon. Jamie, maybe a question for you. You guys have spoken pre-pandemic through the pandemic about having spare capacity to take more business as your performance continues to improve. Obviously, the people's a different story altogether. But Kevin also noted taking some locomotives out of storage. So, how do we think about new capacity coming online as you do see this economic ramp and the favorable volume backdrop? And what does that mean for costs? And I guess the part B to that is, how do you balance the super strength in intermodal today with your desire to expand with better mix and merchandise? Jamie Boychuk : Look, on our capacity side out there in the network, I still feel confident that there's many sections of our network where we can continue to absorb 20%, 30% business. In some sections that as we work close with Mark and his team, where we are reaching out to customers and understanding where that flow is going to come from, which will require a few more train starts. We have -- and, of course, I'm basing this off of us just over, let's say, three quarters ago when we were looking in the midst of a pandemic, and we were winding things down and record low numbers with respect to all of our assets. That's what we're basing this off of when we start talking about what we're going to need to pull out. So, yes, we're getting ready with locomotives, still going to be less than where we were a year ago or two years ago, with where the volume was at, we'll still see record levels with respect to productivity out of our locomotives and our people. So it comes down to the mix of business that we're going to see. We're making sure that we're able to provide that service that brings the customers to us. So that's something that we're really working on. And when we think about assets of people, attrition was a higher rate that we -- than we really expected throughout the pandemic. Those people, I think, it's just like the trucking industry, those who decided they may have thought they were going to hold on and not retire for a while. Well, they retired, and they packed it in, and it was a little too much for them. So, yes, we're going to see some of these assets come back. They're not going to be at the same levels that we had seen before. So, I think, as Kevin had mentioned, we're still going to see some good returns on all of this business that continues to come back in. And, I'm sorry, the second part, I think you mentioned was on the intermodal side. It was -- what was that question? Jonathan Chappell : It was just balancing the equipment as intermodal\u2019s been incredibly strong, but you obviously have this desire to kind of improve the mix through merchandise growth. Jamie Boychuk : Yes. I mean, look, we -- where we can, we'll run intermodal with freight together and then in other areas where intermodal continues to grow. I still have room on the tail end of intermodal trains. Very few of my intermodal trains, as it stands, are sold out. We have cars and storage that we're able to pull out, and we continue to pull out as we see the need. Growth has been very strong, as Jim has mentioned. And our terminals are in fantastic shape. Scott Marsh and his team that take care of the intermodal side of the business, have done an incredible job turning the assets when they arrive. And we continue -- fully expect to continue to see that productivity get better as we move forward. Jonathan Chapel : Great. Thank you, Jamie. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. David Vernon : Hey guys. Good afternoon Jim. I appreciate you taking the time to share with us your sort of perspective on the historical sort of industry approach to consolidation. I wanted to ask you a question in a slightly different way. As you think about this opportunity to drive highway conversions on the CSX property. How would you think that an end-to-end merger might accelerate your ability to drive further highway conversions, whether it's carload or intermodal? And how is the Board thinking right now about the pros and cons of pursuing some sort of consolidation to help accelerate the highway conversion plan? Jim Foote : Well, yes, you can answer the question in a different way, but you're going to get the same answer. As I said to the extent that the rail networks work together and however you go about that in creating a better product for the customer. And then mergers eliminate the bottleneck in between that it speeds things up and makes the service product a lot better and more truck like. But that's not my job, that's my opinion. It's not my job to rule upon the merits of any transaction based upon the facts, and I'm sure the regulator will do a very thorough analysis and determine, again, as I said before, whether or not -- it's not anticompetitive and it's in the public interest. David Vernon : So -- but in your view, the industrial logic of that end-to-end merger would help you to drive highway conversions. That's kind of what I'm trying to get at? Jim Foote : Yes. Normally, one person in -- one person who is managing the supply chain the conveyor belt is better than having a one conveyor belt and having somebody take it off the conveyor belt and put the box onto the next conveyor belt for somebody else to run it. Normally, that seamlessness results in a smoother supply chain. And again, like I said, that's my opinion. But then somebody else has to look at it and say, Dave think it's a good idea. David Vernon : All right. Thanks for taking the question. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jordan Alliger : Yes. You mentioned the slides increased visibility onto the positive economic momentum. I was wondering if you could perhaps pinpoint some thoughts around that. Is it still focus primarily on the intermodal recovery, you're actually anticipating and seeing or expect the industrial side to -- is that the biggest part of the higher visibility, the insight into the industrial versus intermodal? Thanks. Jim Foote : Well, I think it's a number of factors. Again, in January, when we were trying to take a view out for the next 12 months, I said that it was difficult to predict. And that my crystal ball was a little fuzzy, trying to determine about at that point in time, COVID cases were out of control. At that point in time, there was just a speculation about what was going to happen with the chip shortages. And so then -- and a number of people were forecasting GDP growth of X, Y and Z. Was there going to be a stimulus package? Was there not going to be a stimulus package? Was there going to be an infrastructure bill? Was there not going to be an infrastructure bill? And then you added into my crystal ball effect that it turned into more of a snow globe in February. Well, some of that smoke has cleared and people have taken their -- most people have taken their forecasts for growth this year up. And we're starting to now see it, feel it, have conversations with real-life customers about what they think is going to happen for the second half of the year. So that's what I what I mean by having more clarity in terms of trying to me tell the management team here at CSX, how to plan forecast and how we're going to run the business for the rest of the year. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Jim, if I can just follow-up on the topic of highway conversions. I mean, when you look at the last three years, we've had two of the tightest truck markets in history. So this should be the time when you guys have more volumes that you can possibly handle on the intermodal side and yet kind of look over the last several years, kind of, intermodal volumes haven't really materially gone up. So I'm just trying to understand what's that hold up there? Is it just more resources and capacity on the rail side? And if that's the case, why don't you guys just put in billions of dollars into increasing capacity of the volumes are there? Or if not, does there need to be a material change in the service product to actually close that volume gap and drive material highway conversion to rail? Jim Foote : Well, again, let's focus on the intermodal side of the business. In 2017, we took off -- we demarketed about 8% of the intermodal business. In 2018, we demarketed about another 8% of the intermodal business. We then went into an industrial recession in a global pandemic. And throughout all of that, we're now producing phenomenal record volume levels for CSX. So not sure what you missed. On the merchandise side of the business, we're doing a really good job there. As I said, we're starting to convert business from the highway, which involves really no financial investment. It involves an investment on our part to make a commitment to the customer that we're going to provide them with truck-like reliable service, which we're now doing. And we're converting this. So I'm very -- obviously, I'd like to turn around 50 years of decline in the railroad industry in a couple of weeks and spending a couple of billion dollars, but I don't think that's possible. Ravi Shanker : Okay. Understood. And I'm sorry if I missed this in your prepared remarks, but what's the current kind of percentage of the workforce that's kind of impacted by the pandemic and kind of maybe kind of on leave right now pending either vaccination or kind of quarantine? I think in the past, you've said that in some locations up to 20% of your workforce was out of commission, kind of what's the updated number now? Jim Foote : Well, 20% would have been kind of like on a terminal specific basis, really on the western side of the railroad where we had kind of a cluster. Clearly, we don't have 20% of our workforce off sick. I think the number of employees who have contracted the virus is so far -- is around 13%. I think that's the right number. Yes, around 3%. Clearly, we had a spike. We had a peak just like everybody sells in the US coming out of Christmas. They gradually declined. Kind of going into March, the numbers were really, really low. I was feeling really, really optimistic. Everybody here in Jacksonville got their shots. And now the cases are spiking back up just like they are every place else. So, we're watching it. But again, it's a much -- in total of the workforce, it's kind of around the national average. We're a good indicator of -- we're at or slightly below the average -- national average for infection rates, which I think is fantastic when you think that all of our employees are out there and have been out there since the very beginning of all of this, ended January 2020 working -- going to work every single day. And we have less than the national average of infection rate, that's phenomenal work by our employees of taking care of themselves and their coworkers. Ravi Shanker : Understood. Thank you. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital. Your line is open. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much. I guess my question, Jim, is on the potential impact a kind of a surge here in demand conditions? I know railroads haven't always like surges, surges or a big decline study as kind of -- is a better situation to be in. But what's different now would you say and maybe Jamie chimes in here, but what's different about how your network, your organization is set up to be able to handle surges? And are we able -- can you do that without major sort of disruption and the customers feeling the effect of those surges as kind of we did when the weather was a little inclement there? Just curious in that direction. Jim Foote : Well, I think that what's different, first of all, is a mindset, a common focus amongst all of the railroads in North America in terms of wanting to move our customers' products more efficiently, effectively and then adjusting your workforce, so that it thinks differently, is more nimble, it's responsive to customer needs and wants to grow the business. So, I think, we have changed to a large degree, one positive that comes out of adopting a different business model is a completely different mindset amongst your workforce. We've got a long ways to go there. But -- and we're not afraid to how do we make sure that we don't get ourselves in a situation where we can't handle peaks in shipping volume. We were talking about at the end of last year, four months ago about hiring, because we want to make sure we're in a position to run our -- move our customers' freight in June, July and August. Nobody -- no other railroad guy would even talk like that before. They would, oh, God, we're not going to hire. We've got to lay off people. Things are bad. We got to lay off more people. We got to cut the workforce. We've got to do -- we\u2019ve got a furlough. We've got to park locomotives. Well, then the business would have surged back, and you wouldn't have been able to handle it. So, I think, we do a better job now as an industry of trying to look out in the future to make sure that we're in a position to be able to handle the peaks and valleys. I mean, think about what we went through in the last year. Just take the auto business as an example. Forecasted car sales are going to be very, very strong. We're going into January. Three months later, I looked on the morning report about how much auto traffic we were moving in, it was zero. And then we thought, well, this will never start back up. This is going to be a very slow startup. How are we going to handle this? And the next thing we know, we get a call saying all the manufacturers are going back to restart their plants three shifts a day. We were able to move, respond and be able to serve that customer segment in a manner that had very, very little disruption. We all geared up into January of this year figuring, all right, it's going to be another great year. And then guess what? All the plants are shut down again, because they can't get a computer chip. So throughout the peaks and valleys, we've been able to move and be nimble and take care of that very, very important customer base for us. And it's no different than take one of our very, very important intermodal customers that ship in boxes for the peak season. Well, the peak season started about three months earlier than peak season and then never stopped. So we've been there. Our terminals have been open now 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, moving as much as we can, record volumes. And so, we think differently and we respond differently. Walter Spracklin : That\u2019s great. I appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Gentlemen, good afternoon. Wanted to talk a little bit about the intermodal side again, clearly, you're taking business off the highway and that seems to be working. Where do you think you stand competitively with your Eastern partner? Do you think you're taking market share there? And just in general, growing the intermodal business. You mentioned you have room on the back of the trains. Is there anything out there in the marketplace right now, limiting your ability to grow? Is it drivers for the drayage side? Is it actual physical boxes? Is there anything standing in your way of growing even more than you are now? Jim Foote : Well, that's a very good question. In terms of what it is that CSX has controlled over, I would say very little. We have train capacity. We have a very good service product. Our terminals are fluid. We can handle more volume and we can do that. In terms of the environment in which we're trying to be able to do all these things, there's not an area that I can look at. It's not in disruption or is a mess, whether its steamships backed up at the ports, West Coast, East Coast, sideways and the Suez, whether there's driver shortages, whether there's chassis shortages, whether there's box shortages. The entire global supply chain is stressed that I think everybody in the industry in all of the railroad at all of our major channel partners are doing an amazing job of trying to keep up with things and meet the needs of the consuming public when you're seeing these big changes in buying and shipping habits. Jason Seidl : And in terms of your market share on the rail side? Jim Foote : I think, again, I think we're doing -- I think we're doing a really good job. I think that the industry on a whole is clearly up, and that's despite, as I said, all of the supply chain being really under a lot of pressure in some absolutely horrible weather conditions across the continent in the middle the middle of a pandemic. Jamie Boychuk : Just one thing to add on that is, I think we're really proud of the team with respect to what Jim had mentioned. We stayed open 24/7 through the polar vortex and everything else that happened out there. We were one of the only rails that never shut any gates. We were there for our customers. We supplied the service that we said we would, and we expect to be able to do that as we continue to move forward. Jason Seidl : Well that\u2019s we hear in the marketplace too. Appreciate your time guys. Jim Foote : Hello? Operator : Our last question coming from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much and thanking for taking my question. Jim, it's been a long call, but you mentioned something about the steamship backup, so they're still going on in the delays. I just wanted to ask you, all these inefficiencies, is it getting better on the East Coast ports for you? And can your system handle when these backups start to clear up and those volumes come to highway? How much business do you think you could be doing maybe not right now because of some of these inefficiencies that you are referring to in Jason's question? Jim Foote : Well, again, we're part we're part of a chain. We're a link in the chain. And it's easier to move. It's easier to move the chain when it's not kinked and there's no problems in it and everything is working smooth. So I think that all of us would be -- could move more. Listen, the port guys don't want to --they don\u2019t want to put boxes on the ground, because they don\u2019t have a chassis, because they don\u2019t have a truck to dray it, because they can't -- the railroads are backed up, because the railroads don't want to deal with somebody putting the box on the ground because of this. We all would like things to be smoother, and we would all benefit from this. And I think that right now, if you added up all the pluses and minuses, rail versus truck, I think the rail comes out on top. People want to -- people will talk -- people start talking about autonomous trucks and that's the solution and how do we do this and how do we run more and how do we become more energy efficient and how do we do -- I say put it on the rail. We'll just take 200 of those trucks, and we'll take it across country with a crew of two, and save you 75% in terms of your emissions and your fuel spend. So we're there. We're ready. We're growing, like I said, we're setting records. And hopefully, we can get in the position where we just continue to set record after record after record after record. But it all takes -- we got the capacity. We have the ability. We just got to keep getting in there and fighting every single day to get as much freight as we possibly can. Jamie Boychuk : And when you take a look at the driver shortage that's out there, a lot of the driver shortage is coming on the long-haul truckers. A lot of those truckers that like the long haul and wanted to move across the country, less and less of those are available. And when you look at drayage, when we bring it into town and we have someone who can dray it across town and go to bed every single night and be with their families, that seems to be the trend of what the new truck driver is out there, which again gives rail that advantage. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. This concludes today's -- Jim Foote : Thank you, everyone, for calling in today. I really appreciate your good questions and look forward to talking to you all soon. Thank you. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Bill Slater, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Bill Slater : Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Sean Pelkey, Acting Chief Financial Officer. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. James Foote : Great, thanks Bill, and thank you for joining us on the call today. This quarter's results highlight just how quickly volumes have rebounded as each of our three lines of business experienced record growth as we lapped the most severe economic impacts of the pandemic. I want to first thank all of the CSX's railroaders for their unwavering commitment to our customers as they worked very hard to deliver service in a very difficult operating environment. As we enter the second half of the year, our focus is squarely on continuing this growth. We have kept our yards and terminals open and freight moving throughout the recovery and we will continue taking the necessary steps to add resources and increase fluidity in order to help customers meet their own growth targets this year despite the ongoing supply chain disruptions. Let's begin with Slide 5 in the presentation and an overview of our second quarter financial results. Operating income increased to $1.69 billion and earnings per share rose to $0.52. These figures include $349 million and $0.12 per share impact from the sale of property rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia. Our operating ratio was 43.4 including an 11.7 percentage point impact from the Virginia transaction. Excluding these impacts, operating income increased 62%, earnings per share increased 82%, and the operating ratio improved 820 basis points. Turning to Slide 6, revenue increased 33% on 27% volume growth. Merchandise revenue increased 26% on 21% higher volumes led by automotive, metals and equipment and Ag improved markets. Intermodal revenue increased 42% on 28% volume growth setting a new record for average daily volume. Both domestic and international volumes increased significantly and continued to benefit from strong demand for transportation services as well as growth from East Coast ports. Coal revenue increased 47% on 44% higher volumes with growth across all core markets. Domestic coal benefited from higher utility and industrial demand in both export net and thermal coal volumes rebounded meaningfully. Other revenue growth was driven by increased intermodal storage and equipment usage as well as higher revenue from affiliates. Turning to Slide 7, we remain committed to being the safest railroad. In the second quarter we achieved a new record low number of train accidents driven by our focus on increased communication and education to reduce human factor caused accidents. Safety initiatives for the remainder of the year will focus on culture, communication, and continuous education. As an example, we've recently introduced a modified approach to operational testing for T&E employees. The new program is designed to be instructive rather than disciplinary to increase employee engagement and create lasting changes in behavior. Combined with face to face safety summits and expanded education of top causes of incidents, these new programs will further reduce risk and protect our workforce. Moving to Slide 8, let's review this quarter's operating metrics. The intermodal segment continues to perform well. Intermodal trip plan performance averaged 89% for the quarter and through this of our reservation system and the hard work of our intermodal team, we have kept all our intermodal terminals open over the last year as volumes surged. Carload trip plan performance improved sequentially to 69% for the quarter and we are focused on continuing this positive momentum throughout the rest of the year. We are also working to further improve network fluidity. Car dwell improved sequentially and remains the lowest in the industry. Velocity began to turn positively exiting the quarter and we expect to see further improvements in both metrics in the second half of the year. On Slide 9, I want to take the opportunity to highlight some of the actions we are taking to resource the network for growth. As I mentioned on previous calls, we entered the year planning to add community headcount in response to the expected growth and we'll continue adding through the second half of the year. Over the past several months we have increased the size and number of our new conductor classes and then also enacted new programs to improve availability of existing employees to ensure that we have resources in place to capture the rising demand and serve our customers well. We staged locomotives across the network as we prepared for the incremental volumes. While these assets provide additional flexibility to react to customer demand, we are maintaining a balanced operating plan and we are investing in the safety and reliability of our network. We demonstrated this commitment by maintaining our capital spend throughout the pandemic and we continue to invest with a focus on the long-term growth and sustainability of our business. We still have ample capacity across the network for growth and we are working to find new ways to improve the efficiency and impact of our capital spending programs. Turning to Slide 10, our focus on investing for the future extends through improving the safety, productivity and sustainability of CSX's operations through the increased use of technology, while we are driving further emissions reductions through our advancement of energy management software and the expanded use of fuel saving technologies. In addition to the almost 40% increase in distributed powertrains year-over-year, we continue to expand the number of distributed power equipped locomotives. We are adding that capability to approximately 100 locomotives this year in addition to including that in all the locomotive rebuilds we are performing. We are also expanding use of inspection technologies to improve the safety of our operations and then increase the efficacy of our track maintenance and repair programs. We are performing roughly 80% of our drone inspection flights this year and our increased use of autonomous track inspections cars with improving safety by better highlighting areas in need of repair. Lastly, we are providing our field employees with digital tools to replace inefficient manual or paper based processes to increase the speed of communication across the railroad. We have distributed roughly 9000 tablets to employees which are improving both safety and productivity by allowing real time information sharing and feedback. We are pleased with the success of these programs to date and we are only beginning to see the potential value these investments can bring. With more efficient network planning and dispatching we are changing our customers interactive CSX. We see significant opportunities to leverage technology to improve the pace and quality of decision making across our business. I'll now turn it over to Sean to run through the numbers. Sean Pelkey : Thank you, Jim. I'm pleased to be here today and I'm excited for the opportunity to continue serving this company at an important time in our history as we focus on culture, innovation and growth. Looking at the second quarter financial results on Slide 12, revenue increased $735 million or 33% versus the prior year. This reflects growth across every market as we cycle the impacts of COVID-19. Revenue per unit growth of 5% includes a 2% impact from higher fuel surcharge revenue, combined with favorable pricing and higher other revenue. Total expenses were 9% lower in the quarter. These results included a $349 million gain related to the sale of property rights to Virginia which was partially offset by the impact of higher fuel price. Excluding the property gain and the impact of fuel price, expenses would have been up 9% on a volume increase of 27%. Before I get into specifics by line, I would like to address the topic of inflation. The good news is, we have secured adequate inventory and supply commitments for critical materials and we've worked to lock in the vast majority of unit costs for 2021. Excluding locomotive fuel, expense inflation this quarter was just above 3% and we don't expect that to move much going into the second half. We are seeing cost pressures on capital materials for core infrastructure and are working to offset that through increased productivity, sourcing shifts and inventory management. We don\u2019t expect any change to the overall capital budget this year. Several of our supplier contracts are based on lagging indicators, so we will continue to monitor things closely going into next year and ensure inventory levels for critical materials remain adequate. Now, moving down to the specific expense line items for Q2, labor and fringe was up 18%. Higher volume and inflation together drove a $75 million increase in expense. Additionally, incentive compensation increased $60 million on higher projections for award payouts this year coupled with prior year downward adjustments related to COVID impacts. We continue to absorb growth on the network and sustain productivity gains. As we work to hire conductors, we've increased the use of distributed power and continue to optimize the plan. While total headcount is roughly flat from year-end 2020, the active T&E count is up approximately 200 this year, and we expect continued sequential increases in the third and fourth quarters. MS&O expense increased 6% or $23 million in the second quarter as higher volumes and inflation were the primary drivers. Locomotive productivity measured in GTMs per available horsepower hour improved 4% compared to the second quarter of last year. We expect this to improve even further going forward as velocity and cycle times recover. In addition, we are absorbing growth and driving efficiencies at our intermodal terminals with cost per container lift down 12% year-over-year. Fuel expense increased $103 million driven by average fuel prices that nearly doubled as well as higher volume. During the quarter we also recorded an $18 million benefit related to the settlement of the state fuel tax matter. Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $4 million in the quarter primarily due to a larger asset base. Equipment rent expense increased $9 million or 12%. The impact of higher volume on freight car rents was partially offset by higher net earnings at affiliates. As a result of the Virginia transaction, gains on property dispositions increased significantly in the second quarter. As a reminder, the gain during the quarter was related to the first phase of the transaction. Total proceeds are expected to be $525 million including $200 million already received, $200 million later this year, and the remaining $125 million expected next year. Turning below the line, interest expense improved $10 million, due to a lower weighted average coupon and lower average debt balances. Other income increased $5 million as favorable pension impacts were partially offset by lower interest on cash held. Income tax expense increased $204 million, mostly due to higher pre-tax income. The effective tax rate was 23.3% and was impacted by a state legislative change this quarter. Closing out the income statement, CSX delivered operating income of $1.7 billion. The reported operating ratio was 43.4%, including a benefit of approximately 1200 basis points from property gains. Now these results do not include any impact from the Quality Carriers acquisition, which closed on July 1. The acquisition will add approximately 6% to CSX's revenue, and is expected to be relatively neutral to operating income and EPS this year due to the impact of transaction and integration related expenses. Quality tracking revenue will be recorded in the other revenue line. On the cost side, about two thirds of the expense will be MS&O. About one quarter of it is split between labor and fuel with the rest hitting depreciation and rents. Going forward we expect to leverage the Quality transaction to accelerate rail growth by offering new multimodal products, extending our reach and further integrating CSX into our customers supply chains. Now turning to cash flow on Slide 13. As you know, free cash flow is a major focus for this team. Through the second quarter free cash flow before dividends was $1.9 billion up 35% versus the prior year. Just to put that in context, that's $300 million more free cash flow than we generated in all of 2017. Year-to-date free cash flow conversion on net income is 100%, and we expect it to remain near that level on a full year basis. The company's cash balance remains elevated at nearly $3 billion. Our expectation remains that this will normalize over time as we continue to invest in the business, and return capital to shareholders. Year-to-date shareholder returns are nearly $1.7 billion, including approximately $1.3 billion in buybacks and $400 million in dividends. We remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders with a balanced and opportunistic approach to buybacks. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. James Foote : Great, thanks, Sean. Concluding with Slide 15, we are maintaining a full year revenue outlook. Excluding the impact from Quality Carriers, we continue to project double-digit revenue growth for the year. As Sean mentioned, the acquisition will add approximately 6% incremental revenue growth on an annualized basis, and we expect the impact this year to be about half of that. We will achieve these growth targets by providing our customers with a high quality service product. As I said, we are taking necessary steps to ensure we deliver on this commitment. Our capital expenditure outlook remains at $1.7 to $1.8 billion for the year and we will continue returning cash to shareholders. Demand remains strong and so does our commitment to customers. We are resourcing the network for growth. We are driving operational improvements to add capacity through increased asset utilization. We are investing in our business for the long-term and we continue to design new and creative solutions through our customers to move more freight with CSX today, and for years to come. Now back to Bill for the Q&A. Bill Slater : Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time, I would ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question. With that, we will now take questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Allison Landry : Good afternoon and thanks. I was hoping you could maybe talk about the underlying pricing environment specifically what you're seeing on contract renewals even if just directionally from Q1? And then just, given the myriad of inflationary pressures and very tight truck capacity, do you think there is scope for a more rapid acceleration in core price when you see the cost cycle? Thank you. Kevin Boone : Hey Allison, this is Kevin. In terms of price inflation today, and cost inflation what we are seeing and I'm keeping close with Sean and staying close to that so we can be transparent with our customers and explain to them what we're seeing in the market, none of that is a surprise to them. They're seeing it in their business. They certainly understand the pressures that are out there in terms of labor and other material costs. What we're really trying to do is see if some of these things are transitory or whether they're really here for the long term and we'll continue to evaluate that throughout the year. When you look at generally our contracts we have a lot of those renewals that occur in the fourth and first quarter. They're concentrated in those quarters and really it represents about 70% of our annual contract renewal activity, so we'll continue to look at that. We're communicating transparent with our customers and expect to obviously achieve that cost inflation through our pricing. Allison Landry : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Amit Mehrotra : Thank you, operator. Hi everyone and congrats on the on the great performance. Sean, if I look at the underlying operating ratio in the second quarter of 55.1%, is there any reason that that moderates in the back half? I guess you have to add that, we have to add the Quality Carriers into the mix, that looks like it's maybe 100 bps of negative impact this year given it's half of the $600 million or so in revenue. But I would just, if you just take that and table it for a second, mix is getting better hopefully in the back half. Kevin just talked about 70% repricing towards the end of this year and maybe half of that towards the end of this year. I would just expect that the underlying OR [ph] ex-the Quality Carriers acquisition gets better in the second half versus the stellar performance in the second quarter, if you can just help us think about that? Thank you. Sean Pelkey : Yes, thanks Amit. So, when you think about the second quarter, not a whole lot of unique items in there other than Virginia transaction, and then I talked about the impact of the fuel tax settlement there. So strip those out and carry it forward to the second half of the year, what's going to impact the operating ratio in the second half of the year Quality, you're right, I think you're doing the math correctly there. We've got some hiring to do, so we're going to be bringing on some crews. If we bring on the crews and network fluidity improves and we're able to move the volume that will be a positive, but there'll be a cost to bringing those crews on. We'll also going to have some incentives here to increase the availability of crews. So that will be an impact. And then, probably the biggest variable is what does volume look like in the second half. We've been able to demonstrate here, albeit on a relatively easy comp that the drop through is pretty good, but the margins in the second half will be highly dependent on what the volume looks like. Amit Mehrotra : Right, but then on the labor side, I think they're 6% to 7% of the workforce that it fits every year. So, when you're talking about growth in sequential labor or headcount, is that a net number or gross number net of attrition if you can just provide a little bit color on that as well? Sean Pelkey : Yes, so I mean, we're going to continue hiring through the rest of the year and as long as we need to in order to move the volume and increase fluidity. I would expect sequential headcount is probably going to go up a little bit on a net basis, both in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Amit Mehrotra : Okay, makes sense. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Your line is now open. Christian Wetherbee : Yes, hey thanks. Good afternoon everybody. Just may be a question on the revenue outlook for the back half of the year. It sounds you are maintaining your outlook and I think, I guess when we think about volumes, do you feel like the network is at all constrained in order to take on incremental volume? I mean, do you think you're running kind of below what the demand environment would be able to sort of provide you? And then in that context, how do you feel about sort of service, are there some improvements that need to be made whether those heads coming back on or otherwise you are going to reach maybe full potential from the volume growth perspective in the back half? Kevin Boone : Yes Chris. Look, when you look at the transportation sector as a whole, we're not unique. Everyone is having their challenges. The fluidity out there is not very good right now when you look across all modes of transportation and those challenges we're facing the same challenges, getting trucks to pick up the boxes out of our yards, all those things create challenges for us so. Yes I'd say there was opportunity that we weren't able to move in the second quarter, that's probably a fair assessment. As we get more fluid, as we bring on crews, I suspect that that will generate opportunity. We're certainly having those conversations with our customers today. They want additional capacity and we're committed to do everything we can to react as quickly as we can to bring on more people, more capacity to serve those customer needs. We're already starting to have conversations around next year. So I'm communicating every day with Jamie when I'm having discussions with customers and what they need and so we can get out ahead of it with our resources. We can plan ahead, we can commit to delivering any other service that we expect to do. Christian Wetherbee : Got it, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Ken Hoexter : Hey, great, good afternoon and congrats on the solid results. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the congestion that's going on, so obviously you just had a couple questions on employees and ability to handle it. I believe we've seen the two Western rails kind of do embargoes on traffic. Maybe talk a bit about, we've seen your metrics kind of come down in terms of on time performance, talk about if you're starting to see any of that spread to the Eastern network, is there different congestion points that especially what's going on in Chicago that you fear is starting to create any larger backlogs? And then just on that note, your cost per employee really scaled, can you address kind of, if there's anything in that that we should look at going forward? Thanks. James Foote : Yes Ken it's Jim. I'll make a quick comment and then I'll let Jamie follow up with any details if things are necessary. We've been very, very, very committed to making sure that this railroad runs well. It has been an unbelievable challenge. I've never seen any kind of a thing like this in the transportation environment in my entire career where everything seems to be going sideways at the same time. Despite all that, we have been able to keep our terminals open in Chicago, and I hope we can continue to do that. In January when I got on this call, I said we were hiring because we anticipated growth. I fully expected that by now we would have about 500 new T&E employees on the property. No way did I or anybody else in the last six months realize how difficult it was going to be to try and get people to come to work these days. It is an enormous challenge for us to go out and find people that want to be conductors on the railroad, just like it's hard to find people that want to be baristas or anything else, it's very, very difficult. Nor did we anticipate that a lot of the people were going to decide they didn\u2019t want to work anymore. So attrition was much higher in the first half of the year than what we had expected. So even though we brought on 200 new employees, we fell short of where we thought we would be by now going into the year because we anticipated that there was going to be strong demand. We continue to expect there to be strong demand, and as long as there continues to be the forecast for demand, we are going to continue to hire employees, because you need employees to run a railroad. That's what we're managing this company to do, is to serve our customers needs, and we'll bring on the assets and put them into places where they need to be, so that we can move our customers' freight, simple as that. Jamie Boychuk : I mean, I think Jim's comments really nailed it with respect to some of the headwinds that we've faced here with respect to the metrics and where they sit. I'm proud of what this team has been able to do under the environment we've been at, quite confident that in the environment we're in that Kevin and his team is providing us with some great numbers of what we need to look for going forward into the next six to eight months, as far as we can in this industry, but we know we can do better on these metrics and that's what I think is the great opportunity as an operating team as we look forward. We've got the rolling stock that we need. We've got the assets that are sitting there. It's people to Jim's point and I think it was mentioned by Amit it was 8% is what we look at for our attrition, which means we're going to be hiring for attrition, but we're going to be hiring for above attrition as well. We need to get 200 trainees out there, we mentioned that our T&E count is up a couple 100. You know there's more numbers. We know what our number is and we're going to go after that and for us it's all about the reliability to the customer. So as the fluidity picks up, as dwell continues to drop, yes we see some benefits there with costs and the rest of it as we move along, but ultimately, we look at our trip plan performance which is getting better and better, particularly on the intermodal side. On the carload side the reliability is where we need it to be. So we're going to take the steps required in order to get that reliability where it has to be and Kevin and his team are able to go out there and sell the product, which is service, and that's key for us. Without service we're not any different than anybody else, so we've got to continue to capture that which allows us to grow and continue to push forward. So maybe I'll let Sean really touch on the cost per employee. Sean Pelkey : Yes Ken, just quickly on that. So if you're looking year-over-year there's a few things to think about, first is the incentive comp I called out. We've got inflation on the labor side and then we've got a little bit higher over time versus last year as we were obviously scaling down over time with the plummeting volumes. Just the other factor from last year, you remember we had those emergency reserve boards, so we had about 300 employees who didn't have significant wages along with their emergency status there. So looking from the first quarter we're actually down a little bit sequentially reflecting some normal seasonal trends. Ken Hoexter : Great, thanks Jim, Sean, and Kevin, I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Your line is now open. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good afternoon. This is a question I think for Jim, maybe Kevin as well. You've talked about, I think for a couple of years about the opportunity with carload shippers to gain wallet share versus truck. And I think you were developing some good momentum or had some good momentum in that before COVID. I am wondering, it's an unusual circumstance, but does it hurt your ability to continue that program and to kind of gain further share from these shippers given that the rail network is having these challenges? I mean, they're not, a lot of it's not in your control, but how do you think that affects the ability to gain share? And when do you think you kind of get back on track with that share gain for carload shippers? James Foote : Sure Tom. Many times we tried to explain why we're so confident in our ability to grow above traditional rates in our car load merchandise business was because we have if we can develop a product that's truck like we will have a cost advantage that gives the customer lower cost transportation solution, and it would be similar level of reliability. And as we were moving along as you said coming in starting in 2017 getting into the 2019, our reliability was significantly better than where it had been in 2017. Our car load trip plan compliance number was in the high 80%, mid to high 80% range. And so going in and having conversations with a customer who number one was skeptical about switching from truck to rail. We had a very good track record, and interesting product for him to look at. It's unfortunate and I now I have to sit here, much to my disillusionment and say our trip plan compliance number is 69. Is the 69 trip plan compliance much better than it was in 2017? Yes, so we still have the ability to have a good narrative with our customer base, about why it makes sense for them to switch, but it's just simply not as compelling as it was 18 months ago or 15 months ago, or just before the world went sideways on this, so but we're going to get back. That number would be much higher. As I said, the 500 employees that we hoped we would have had here by now, new conductors here by now, that number would have been much higher and we're hiring and doing whatever we possibly can do to run and improve the speed and velocity and reliability of our service and as we do we'll get back to having -- being in a position to having similar conversations with our customers as we did before. At the same time, and it ain't easy to find a truck right now. So it's unfortunate that we're not really, on the one hand we're not as good as we work, but on the other hand, if we -- when we get back to where we were, the opportunity right there is tremendous for us. So nothing has really changed about our optimism at all in terms of this strategy that will drive outsized growth for us as we move forward. It's just unfortunate, that as I said, the world went sideways on us here for a while. But we're coming back, we're coming back strong, and we'll be even better than where we were as we get more time to get things running right. Tom Wadewitz : Is that something that bounces back quickly, like you could be on track and 2022 or do you think the shippers have some kind of readjustment period to reengage on that, that share gain discussion again? James Foote : Again, I hope that our service metrics, as I said, I kind of said on the last call, we'd be in great shape by now, so yes, I expect those numbers to get back by the end of the year. And we position ourselves in the transportation community as it has an extremely good service product. So going into next year, again we're getting truck conversions now. Our intermodal growth to a large degree is coming from converting long haul over the road trucking to intermodal. Our growth in certain segments with certain customers in the car load side is coming at the expense of the truck. So we're still seeing that. I just think that the, again, we are not in, it's not as easy for themselves, the man or woman to go in and talk to a customer today about how great we are and why they should convert more traffic to rail than it was in the fall of 2019. It doesn't mean it's not achievable. It just means it's not as easy and we'll just have to work harder. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. Thanks for all the perspective. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Scott Group : Hey, thanks, good afternoon, guys. So, Kevin, it feels like for now we've got a favorable environment for coal. Maybe just talk about what you're expecting from the volume and RPU standpoint on coal going forward. And then just separately, Jim, just any thoughts on the executive order and how you guys think about reacting responding in any way? Kevin Boone : Yes, the coal market is similar to a lot of the other markets that we're, we talked about today is the same. Its demand is outstripping supply. You're having the coal mines trying to catch up. They've under invested, so they are catching up on some of their investments. They are having some of the same struggles we are on the people side. So we're seeing all that today. You see the underlying commodity prices, whether it's natural gas here in the U.S. or met coal prices internationally, and thermal coal prices internationally, they're all supportive of an uptick in volume and will start to lapse and continue to lapse some very easy comps into the back half of the year. So we do expect growth, but not back to the levels that we saw in 2019 and a lot of that is based on the supply chain continue to try to catch up with the demand. So we're already having discussions with our customers and what does it look like for next year and how do we continue to replenish inventories, particularly here on the domestic side, where inventory levels are very low. We're in a situation right now, where we're trying to keep inventory levels to above those critical levels, so they can continue to burn and serve their customers. But, the environment is quickly turned up, I had discussions last week, they didn't see this coming. They were surprised about how quickly the market recovered. And so we're all communicating and really trying to understand how they can do better, how they can on the supply side, and how we can deliver the transportation services so they can deliver to their end customer. But, very good outlook, when you look at RPU is a little bit on the international side that we'll see favorability, particularly on the met side, where our price follows the commodity price and domestic will be relatively similar kind of dynamics that you saw in the second quarter going forward, so good market there. James Foote : Yes, Scott on the executive order, I guess when we first heard about it, before it had actually been released, it seemed like the administration had for some reason sitting out the railroads and steamship businesses. Once the full information got out, and we were able to digest it, and find out that it covered everything and everybody, and especially tech, we got a little better viewpoint of what it was all about. And it appears to be pretty much not a lot of new items in it, but if any, but the agenda as it relates to railroads, the agenda that has been moving for a long at the Surface Transportation Board for years. So it was kind of like, what are the other things that\u2019s going on at the Surface Transportation Board, and we're just kind of listed along with every other regulatory move afoot in all industries. And, it's really my personal opinion, it's really unfortunate, when the supply chain, all of these essential workers who have been doing an amazing job now in during a pandemic, are kind of singled out as, our railroad is made up of all these employees that are out there working, and all of these regulatory ideas, which are really pushed forward by industry lobbyists, who want to change the rules and regulations, decided at this point in time when everybody's working so hard, that we should suddenly upend and take advantage of a difficult time to try and push forward a regulatory agenda. So it's not much new. I was somewhat disillusioned about what it really was but we're used to handling it in and then we'll move forward. Scott Group : Thank you for the time guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Fadi Chamoun with BMO. Your line is now open. Fadi Chamoun : Yes, hi. I was on mute I'm sorry. A question on Quality Carriers, if you can give us maybe your first impression, if we had some communication with clients, how are they perceiving this combination? And secondly, as we go into 2022, I think you mentioned for this year, it's going to breakeven on an operating income basis. But as we go into 2022, how are you thinking about the contribution of that business to operating income? Kevin Boone : This is Kevin. The quality integration of July 01 you could imagine we got our teams together and quickly after that our sales team along with Quality sales team, and their feedback so far from the customer has been overwhelmingly positive. They're looking for capacity in the market. We have several ongoing initiatives currently with customers that will offer that capacity that they're looking for. We're doing all of our diligence, making sure when we bring on the service, we communicate with Jamie and his team and that we can service that business to the standard that we expect. So there's -- we'll do it very carefully and very methodically, particularly in this market today. But this is a product that we knew that's going in because we did our diligence ahead of that, we surveyed our customers and we surveyed their customers and we asked them this is something that they feel is needed in the market. And the overwhelming response was, yes, we would like this in the market, they see the value. We will be thoughtful on how we bring it on. We have a lot of inbound customers calling us, looking to come up with additional solutions. And we'll bring those on. But it's been great so far. Our teams are working very, very closely together and we're working closely with others. And so they can understand the opportunities in ways that we're thinking about bringing in a lot more into the network. And I'll let Sean handle the financial side of it. Sean Pelkey : Yes, and Fadi, so in terms of the financial impact as we get into next year, the core trucking business has truck like margins. So you can expect to see that next year, but it's about the conversion that Kevin has been talking about, when we're able to drive some of that business that's moving over the road today over to the rail, and do it on existing trains, the incrementals on that growth should be pretty significant. We've got to ramp that up over time. We need to make sure we've got the equipment and all the piping in place, but you should see a ramp up in that next year. Fadi Chamoun : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is now open. Justin Long : Thanks and good afternoon. Jim, I wanted to clarify the comment you made earlier on the progression of car load trip plan compliance going forward. Are you saying that getting back to the mid to high 80s was possible by year end? And then from a resource perspective, we've talked a lot about headcount, but can you talk about your plans for redeploying locomotives in the back half of the year as well? James Foote : Yes, I'll let Jamie talk about locomotives, but in terms of my goal to get back to where we were, yes we hope that we could. Where we are right now would be challenging associated with being able to hire people, I don't know if that's achievable. That's my goal. That's what I'd like to see happen. And then I'd like to see us get better from there. I can't say right now whether or not until something changes dramatically in the hiring situation, whether or not we'll be able to achieve that. Jamie Boychuk : On the locomotive side, as we get faster, and we can improve our fluidity out there from even where we are now, we're going to need less locomotives. So the question isn't necessarily where our numbers at now. We are good with what we have for our locomotives. We still got hundreds of locomotives in storage. We've got a great rebuild program that we're continuing to do. We've got 60 rebuilt locomotives coming out here over the next three months, which will allow us to put down some more locomotives that aren't as fuel efficient. So we'll continue along that track and, nothing but continued opportunities, particularly on the technology side, as we continue to work with our zero-to-zero program through Trip Optimizer and Vitronics [ph]. There's a lot to gain as we continue to move forward on that front. Justin Long : Okay, great. I appreciate the time. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Brian Ossenbeck : Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask Kevin for you just for an update on the land portfolio, the industrial pipeline, how you think those things are trending? If those conversations have really changed, given the demand backdrop, what's I guess your timeline expectations for site development or something like that that would come from those efforts it would be more noticeable. And then just to follow up on the question of labor and resources, it sounds like that's the key getting labor, but it also sounds like it's pretty hard for you and for everybody. So maybe you can just give us a sense of your confidence in that. And then if there's any other levers you can pull across the network the different asset deployments that will help you get there if the labor doesn't -- ends up being as hard as it looks right now. Kevin Boone : Well, let me touch on the industrial development and how we're thinking about it. The pandemic really has changed the way how customers are viewing the supply chains and we're really what I'm posing the team to do is we need to be in our that conversation that they're reevaluating it. Are there new facilities, are there new warehousing, is there new production that they're going to want to onshore and how do we sell the opportunity to put that on CSX rail and they get well served. I think the customers understand the opportunity that that gives them in terms of options and be able to move their freight, particularly in an environment where our global supply chain can be challenged, that the freight, the railroads have been reliable and have continued to move freight throughout the pandemic. And they are increasingly seeing the value of that. So I'm excited about leveraging our real estate portfolio, we have a lot of ready sites that they can build on today. We're marketing that along with the real estate team closely and, seeing some traction there. So it's exciting. I think it's early, but I'm hopeful that we'll start to see a little bit more opportunity over the next 12 months as we get out and get in front of our customers there. James Foote : On the labor side, I've been working really closely with our HR department, Diana Sorfleet and her crew. Really the last eight months it's been difficult, there's no question about it. We've gone through some ebbs and flows with our applications have come forward, making sure we get the right people to work in new jobs. Just recently, there's a couple of things that we've done that's helped us. We've come up with a deal with our conductor SMART-TD for an availability agreement, which allows us to work closely with our conductors and make sure that their availability is better than it has been. So that agreement has been successful here over the past couple of weeks, since it's kicked in. And believe it or not, being a fourth generation railroader, I'm a believer that sometimes the best people you get for railroads that stick around are actual people from railroad families. I think there's a few others around this table in the same situation. We have put a referral program together, offering incentives to our employees to refer people to our railroad to work for CSX, and we went from a application of just a few 100 people to I would say, within a two-week period, well over 1000 applicants that we're going through right now to bring on as conductors. So the pipeline has gotten very strong and this program has helped out and of course the referrals will then help people stick around until they understand the job is, they know what it's about, and understand the lifestyle. So this program is really going to help us move forward as we continue to do our hiring. Brian Ossenbeck : All right, thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Jordan Alliger : Yes. Hi, I was just wondering if you could talk a little about the international intermodal front, the issues that are out on the west coast and some of the gating procedures in Chicago. Do you think that's, is that or will that lead as we move towards peak season, retailers and others, perhaps diverting more traffic to the ports in the East Coast and could that lead to additional opportunity for you again, assuming your service could keep up. Thanks. James Foote : Yes, I think, you really identified a trend here. The West Coast ports have struggled, particularly through the pandemic and as freight demand has really picked up here and, the secular trend that we continue to see more freight moving to the East Coast. This is another reason why I think the shippers are going to look for that option and that's the, that's a very good thing for our franchise in the east. We remained fluid. Jamie and his team have done a great job, working with all of our partner port partners to continue to move freight and so the intermodal terminals remain open. We continue to move freight and we want more of it. We're continuing to invest in inland ports and other areas to make sure that we can serve it. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Vernon with Sanford. Your line is now open. David Vernon : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the time. Jamie, it's still unclear to me whether the resource initiatives you're having are a function of having custom deep kind of on the way down, or whether this is just sort of sand in the restart recruiting gears trying to get guys off of the item boards or whatever. Could you talk more specifically to what the core issue is here? And then as a follow up, Jim or Kevin, when do you start getting worried that the service relations you're having now are going to impact your ability to make hey on the -- be a pretty good market next year? James Foote : A little fuzzy, but I think your question is, the issues associated with the employees and we're trying to hire people, correct? David Vernon : Yes. James Foote : Yes. Now, we're not, I don't think, I think this is a trend for every business right now. It's a challenge. I think we're evolving in the way we think about this and have to try and figure out things to do to make these jobs more attractive. They're extremely good paying jobs, with extremely good benefits, with all kinds of other bells and whistles, but in today's world, that's not enough. So a lot of the things we're doing right now in terms of, as Jamie said getting referrals, doing this, doing that, going to fill the need on a short-term basis that I'm convinced, and I think the team is convinced that we need to kind of look at this from a long-term perspective and say, what do we really need to do to make sure that we have a stable, long-term pipeline of people that enjoy coming to work, and doing what they need to do. And, nice weekends, holidays, winter outside, all of that where people before kind of delight [ph] that, they don't want to do that anymore. So we have to look at the whole big picture and we'll do that, because we need employees to run railroads such as that. And so we're going to change our thoughts, our processes and throwing money at people these days is not the answer. David Vernon : And I guess the other question in there was whether and when you start to get worried that the service issues maybe you are having now, starts to impact your ability to kind of take rate up into 2022? James Foote : Well, I think that the, I'm not worried right now, because I think we have plans in place that will get us where we need to be by the end of the year. As I said in my remarks earlier, we were caught somewhat surprised, and as much as we had a plan in place to get us to where we thought we needed to be and the issues that everybody is facing right now kind of flared up. But we have, it has been a full court press. Jamie and I are personally doing everything we possibly can to work with the union leadership to help us make them tremendous in response to making sure that we're ready and willing and able to serve our customers. So I feel pretty good about where we should be absolute working [indiscernible] and working [indiscernible] today. It is not like the pandemic is growing out there, hello, it's alive and well right here. So, who knows what things, what's going to happen in the next couple of weeks, couple of months? Well, let's assume that we have some reasonable health conditions in the country. I feel pretty good we'll go into 2022 rare positions and we will continue to make sure that we have a pipeline of labor coming at us all the time in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC. Your line is now open. Walter Spracklin : Yes, thanks very much. I just have quickly, good afternoon everyone. I just wanted to come back on pricing. But I'd take a different angle in terms of how you're structuring or might be restructuring or changing at all. The type of contracts you're negotiating with your customers and in particular, we're in a period of high pricing, particularly in trucking and intermodal. And there are some questions whether that is sustainable? So my question to you is, are you changing or can you change at all the terms in your contract to lengthen them out to better capture and preserve the current pricing environment longer than you otherwise would have on your prior, under the structure of your prior contracts? James Foote : Well, I don't think there's anything in this environment that changes our overall approach to how we go to market. It's about being transparent with the customer around the cost pressures that we're facing in our business. They get it. They're facing the same issues and having a discussion around that. I'm more interested about how we partner with our customers to grow their business and help them compete in the markets. Those are the things that I'm really focused about. We all realize we have to cover our costs. That's, that's really a secondary discussion. When it comes to the conversations I'm trying to have with the customer. I'm trying to understand how their business is being impacted today, what they expect, how they expect to grow next year, what can we do from a service, perspective to help them in our new markets, help them advantages in the markets and compete and win share, if they're winning in the market, we're going to win. And so a lot of those conversations are happening today. Certainly, we expect to cover our costs going forward, but really, it's a combination of volume growth, and we want to grow with our customers, and we want them to be successful growing their business going forward. Kevin Boone : Yes, it wasn't so much to take advantage, but more to come to an agreement where okay, capacity is very tight, maybe a customer wants to lock in higher for longer, and you can accommodate that through longer terms. Just curious if any of that is coming up where customers wanting to -- desperate for capacity wants to lock in for longer and if you can, keep that pricing in as a result for longer as well, that sounds like that's not happening. James Foote : No, look, I'm a 100% confident. I talk with Jamie every day that this network is going to get better and better and we're going to enter next year, able to service our customers. And we're having those discussions of how we bring on more volume. And what we're asking our customers to do is tell us what that volume looks like. So we can resource and prepare from a headcount perspective all the crews. We certainly have the locomotives. We have the assets out there to go and service that business. So we want to get ahead of that. It's been incredibly hard markets to predict what volumes are going to do and we've all been surprised about the shape of the recovery. But what we're trying to do and get out in front, so we know how much we need to hire and get way out ahead of it, to make sure that we're there for the customer going forward. Walter Spracklin : Makes sense. I appreciate the time. Operator : Your next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Your line is now open. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a question about automotive where volumes are up a lot, but presumably not as much as they could be. So could you talk about the extent to which you have visibility to when the chip shortage might improve? And do you think that the pent-up demand that might be released once that happens could be a tailwind that could contribute to above trend volume growth into 2022? James Foote : Well, and you're probably looking at the same data I am. You can't find a used car, you can't find a new car. It's another market where demand is outstripping supply. We're close to -- we stay close with our auto customers. We've seen rolling shutdowns and auto plants that we serve. And that continues to persist. When we came into the year we started to see the problem. The problem seems to continue to move to the right. It's going to impact our third quarter. And, the question remains, how long into the fourth quarter that goes and does it extend into next year? Are there going to be other supply constraints in the market, other materials that will provide shortages? It's a global supply chain and so what's the next thing that we could run out of? That's what we're all watching. But to stay in close with the customers and we do know there's pent-up demand are going into next year, that will help a of other markets that we serve, I think, the metals market, plastics, all those are inputs into the auto industry today. And hopefully it provides another incremental growth lever that will be pulled as we move into 2022. But there's, everybody sees that there's a lot of pent-up demand. The auto production today has continued to come down given the supply constraints out there. Cherilyn Radbourne : That\u2019s all from me. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ravi Shankar : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Couple of follow-ups. Jim, I wanted to follow up on your comment earlier that now throwing money is not going to solve the labor problem, which doesn't make sense, given some the structural issues. But in the near term, I think a lot of the other industries are throwing money the problem, whether it's trucking or fast food or retail or whatever. So I mean, are you saying that you're not going to go down that route at all or at what point do you do that? And also, kind of, how do we think about revenue per employee in the back half of the year? James Foote : Well, I personally think that we're, as I said, we need to look at, fundamentally look at what we need to do to make sure that we have a content happy workforce over the long period of time. And so that's what we're trying to do. I think that's kind of the plan in most businesses, whether it's bringing on to work or whatever it is you might need to do to make your job more fulfilling, that's great. If I'm a trucking company or an intermodal company and I decide that the smart thing to do is to pay my truck driver a quarter of a million dollars a year to drive a truck and then as always happens in the trucking business. Not maybe next year, but the year after, when the bottom drops out and there is excess capacity all over the street and people are driving trucks for their rates in order to put gas in the tank, the business model doesn't work so good. So we try to take a longer term more holistic approach to managing our workforce. Ravi Shankar : Got it. If I can squeeze in a follow up, the other revenue was about over $103 [ph] million this quarter. Is that a good run rate to look at for the back half of the year? Sean Pelkey : Yes, Ravi. So, that was impacted by the intermodal storage fees that, are due to the supply chain issues in the truck driver shortages that we've been talking about here. So, does that continue into the second half of the year? I think it depends on what happens with the persistence of those issues. But that's really the fundamental driver here in the second quarter. And then of course, you've got the quality impact that will hit other revenue in the second half. So don't forget about that as well. Ravi Shankar : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore. Your line is now open. Jonathan Chappell : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Kevin, just a quick one for you in your new seat, are you going to start for the first time, what impact are scope three [ph] emissions having either for their interest in using the rail to give a bit more of their wallet or from your side, pitching the rail, in addition to your cost benefits, having a mission benefit as well as an opportunity to take more business? Kevin Boone : Well, I can tell you, the environmental fits and definitely moved to the front of our marketing deck and when we discuss with customers. And, I think from the executive level down to starting to flow to the transportation buyers, they realized that\u2019s an initiative coming from the top, it's high priority. And we're an easy solution to solve through that. So it's something I've asked the sales team to continue to press. We are incorporating in every discussion we have going forward, and it's resonated, quite frankly. And so it's a huge, when I think about all the secular trends that are going to help CSX grow going forward, you have the driver shortage. I don't think it gets fixed anytime soon. That's a huge advantage for us. We can supply capacity into the market and then you have the environmental side. Very, very powerful, and it will continue to grow. We've seen all the things that have happened in the market. Investors want it. Our employees want it and our customers and the consumer wants it. So it's something I'm incredibly passionate about. We're going to continue to sell it and it's pretty exciting. Jonathan Chappell : Have you seen it translate yet or do you think it's more of just like the immediate future? Kevin Boone : I think it's always -- it's hard to measure, but we win that business because we're more environmentally friendly than the truck. It's another reason we're winning business today. The other reason, obviously capacity constrained, we can \u2013 we have capacity, we're going to continue to grow capacity it will recover. I'm confident our operating team is going to recover, and we're going to have the best most capacity to offer our customers going into the next year. It is simple as that and so, all those factors play into why we're winning business, why we're winning in the market. But, the tailwinds are there. From a growth perspective it's just, I don\u2019t know -- my responsibility along with Jamie to go out and deliver on that. Jonathan Chappell : Got it. Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Your last question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Kauffman : Thank you very much and thank you for squeezing me in. Sadly, all the intelligent questions have been asked at this point. But let me just come back to the customer side, Jim, because that seems to be a focus in the market side right now. If you had your ability to put all the people you want in the railroad today, and you talked about the challenge and getting to the 500 T&E by this summer, but let's just say you could and you could fix that element of what's going on, how much of the service and the trip plan issues would that solve? Because when I talk to transport companies, they tell me, yes well customers are holding on to equipment a little longer than they should or we've had trouble getting our equipment back or just timely handoffs with some of our other service partners. How much would be fixed, if you had every asset internally that you wanted? James Foote : The employee issue, the Train and Engine service employee issue, will clean up a vast majority of the issues we have that show up and what we call our trip plan compliance number, will improve our velocity, will drive down our dwell. There will still be the noise in the supply chain. It's not going to correct as shortage of chassis, that's not going to correct a shortage of containers or draining or port congestion and that sort of thing, but it will and so therefore it's not Nirvana, but it will certainly help us in terms of being able to improve the overall reliability of our product again, and get it back to where it was, so we can focus on making even better and better. Jeffrey Kauffman : Okay, so you would say the lion's share of getting to where you need to be is something you can handle internally with more resources? James Foote : Yes, I mean, we've always said that. I mean we've -- by changing, fundamentally changing the way this company runs over the last almost four years now, we've freed up capacity across the network. We have significant amount of track capacity so we can add growth without investing in track capacity. As Jamie said earlier, we have locomotives available. We have locomotives on standby. We have locomotives in storage if we need to use them. So yes, the impediment to our performance right now is primarily, if not exclusively, I'd like to say it's primarily because certainly in this business, you have to throw in the occasional pandemic or hurricane. But primarily when we can hire, if I figure out ways, like everybody else in the country, to replenish our workforce, the problem was, we had a pandemic. We didn't hire during the pandemic because the business went away. We have 7% of our workforce that retires every year. 7% of our workforce retired, we thought, okay, the business bounced back, we'll hire 7% of our employees back plus a little bit more to handle the growth. And they're not available. So yes, we'll fix that. It's just taking us longer than we expected and when we get that done, the railroad will be back running the way it did before and we'll get it even better. Jeffrey Kauffman : Okay, congratulations to you and your team in a very challenging environment. Thank you. James Foote : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 2021 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Bill Slater, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Bill Slater : Thank you. And good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are James Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer. Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations, and Sean Pelkey, Acting Chief Financial Officer. On slide two is our forward-looking disclosure. Followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide three. With that, it's my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer James Foote. James Foote : Right. Thanks, Bill. And thank you to all who are joining us today for the call. I want to begin by thanking all of CSX 's employees for their extraordinary efforts to help our customers navigate the strained global supply chain. Across virtually every industry, there are challenges presented by extended lead times, port congestion, shortages of labor and key materials, and lack of storage capacity. While the current operating environment is challenging, we are not sitting idle. We are designing new solutions to help reduce congestion, adding container yards and drayage to keep intermodal terminals fluid. And we're investing in both people and network capacity to ensure CSX is able to reliably meet customer needs today and for years to come. In a few minutes, Kevin will go through the revenue numbers and discuss some of the steps we are taking to provide new service offerings to our customers, to help them overcome these challenges. And Jamie will provide an update of our hiring initiatives, as well as actions we are taking to keep our network fluid. So, let's first turn to the presentation and begin on slide 4 with an overview of our third quarter results. Operating income increased 26% to $1.44 billion. Earnings per share increased 34% to $0.43. And the operating ratio improved by 50 basis points to 56.4. These figures include the results of quality carriers which did not have a significant income -- impact on operating income. But increased third quarter operating ratio by approximately 250 basis points, excluding transaction and integration expenses. I'll now take it over to Kevin. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 5, third-quarter revenue increased 24% year-over-year, with growth across all major lines of business. Inclusion of quality carriers, revenue represented roughly 8% points of the total increase. Supply chain challenges, including a lack of labor and equipment continued to impact almost every market we serve, driving volatility and freight flows and uneven volumes. Merchandise revenue increased 6% on 2% lower volumes as higher revenue across all other markets was offset by declines in auto, driven by the ongoing semiconductor shortages. The industrial and construction related markets, such as metals and equipment or its products and minerals, all showed strong year-over-year volume growth. In addition, our core chemicals business grow, but was partially offset by declines in crude oil and other energy-related markets. Inter-modal revenue increased 14% on 4% higher volumes. Due to increased international shipments as a result of strong demand. Inventory replenishment, and growth in rail volumes from east coast ports. The domestic side was more challenged as multiple supply-side constraints, including container and chassis shortages, have resulted in the inability to meet the strong demand. Coal revenue increased 39% on 16% higher volumes, with growth across all end markets. Domestic coal benefited from higher utility and industrial demand, and export coal revenue increased from the combination of higher demand and higher export benchmark prices. Other revenue increased primarily due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage due to the broader supply chain disruptions from truck driver shortages, chassis availability, and the lack of warehouse capacity. Turning to Slide 6. This is an extraordinary time as customers and global supply chain face challenges we have never experienced before. On trucks to chassis, supports to containers, lack of truck drivers, to labor challenges at the warehouse, and production facilities. We are seeing shortages everywhere. The entire CSX team has been highly focused on delivering new, innovative solutions and partnering with customers to address the supply chain challenges by driving more volume to the railroad. Across the network we have accelerated investments to create new capacity. To address the truck driver shortages, we have added 13 new overflow container yards, implemented new steel wheel options for West Coast cargo. And added Transflo sites that offer customers additional options to move their freight at a lower cost. To address the port congestion and container shortages we have added new solutions to accelerate repositioning of containers. We utilized port deport lanes to alleviate marine terminal congestion. We are working closely with partners, including GPA to utilize additional and Lynn rail yards to help reduce congestion at the port. We have also been aggressively expanding our customer solutions team to further supplement the significant investments we are making in customer facing technology. Our team is working diligently to create new solutions and options for shippers with supply chain disruptions unlikely to improve in the near term. Finally, we are starting to see early signs of customers making long-term investment decisions to reinvest in onshore production and supply chain solutions. To address these customer needs, we continue to develop and invest in new CSX select sites that offer shovel-ready CSX served solution to meet customer requirements. With that, I will hand it over to Jamie to discuss operations. Jamie Boychuk : Thank you, Kevin. As noted, our teams are working closely together to find new ways to overcome the supply chain disruptions, and provide new solutions for our customers. In addition to the ongoing supply challenges, this past quarter was further impacted by a rising COVID mark cost due to the Delta variant. At peak, we had several hundred employees marked off, including regional concentrations that required us to adjust our network plan in real-time to get customers their freight. Despite these challenges, we are able to maintain network performance compared to the prior quarter. And we expect the initiatives we have underway to drive them... fluid going forward, Kevin touched on many of the things we're doing to help reduce congestion at the ports and keep containers moving. And I want to thank my inter modal team for the exceptional work they're doing to accomplish these goals. These efforts are highlighted by the nearly 90% inter modal trip line compliance. They continue to deliver in a challenging environment. We entered the year focused on hiring. The people required to respond to the rising demand. And I'm proud of how our team has been able to think creatively and act decisively to overcome the challenges presented by the tight labor market. Over the course of the year we have redesigned our recruiting process to eliminate unnecessary steps and significantly shorten the time from application to offer. We have also implemented new recruiting tools and referral programs that are improving our application through different conversation rates and better at identifying highly qualified candidates. These efforts have successfully increased the size and frequency of our conductor classes and provided strong ongoing higher visibility by expanding our new higher pipeline, almost 300% since July. We are also increasing intermodal headcount and supplemental labor to keep the terminals fluid and allow us to continue moving containers for our customers. While these hiring initiatives are underway, we're taking steps to increase the availability of our existing T&E workforce. We have implemented new attendance base initiative programs, which allows us to better utilize our existing headcount to move more freight for our customers. We're also making upgrades to our network to increase throughput and create additional capacity. We are installing more automated equipment at our hump yards. We're converting intermodal terminals to grounded facilities in order to increase capacity. And we are expanding our investment in autonomous cranes to increase intermodal terminal throughput. While we still have sufficient line of road capacity, we are strategically investing in growth by extending sidings in select locations across the network. These siding investments will allow us to continue to refine our train plan, and provide growth capacity for years to come. Every action we take is focused on network reliability that begins and ends with running a balanced train plan to minimize delay, and maximize network performance. Running a scheduled network ensures assets are in the right place at the right time. We will continue to maintain network balance and the principles of scheduled railroading as we add resources to meet current demand. These principles have allowed us to keep the intermodal network open and running well this year, and we are focused on continuing the strong performance as we enter into peak season. Turning to Slide 8. Maintaining a safe operation is the foundation to the success of any other operating goal we want to pursue, and we remain committed to being the safest railroad. In the third quarter, personal injury rate improved sequentially, and ongoing safety initiatives also drove a decrease in injury severity. While train accident rate increased slightly from last quarter's record results, accidents rates have improved year-over-year. Focus for the remainder of the year will be critical rule compliance, and reducing human factor accidents. We are leveraging the approximate 9,000 tablets distributed to Field employees to more productively deliver these messages. Not only did the tablets allow real-time communication on key safety information, but we're also able to more effectively combine electronic and in-person communications to increase the impact of our training programs and drive lasting changes, and the behavior that will better protect our employees. I will now turn the call over to Sean for the financials. Sean Pelkey : Thank you, Jamie. And good afternoon. Looking at the income statement on Slide 9, operating income grew nearly $300 million or 26%. Revenue was up 24%, reflecting gains across all major markets, higher fuel prices, and the impact of quality carriers. The operating ratio of 56.4% is a third quarter record for CSX. As we focus on operating efficiently and growing the business. As a reminder, this includes an impact of approximately 250 basis points from the ongoing operations of quality. Looking below the line, interest and other expense was 16 million favorable to last year due to a lower weighted average coupon, and lower average debt balances, as well as favorable pension impacts. An income tax expense was up on higher pre -tax earnings. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3%. Looking at expenses in more detail on the next slide, Total cost increased $349 million or 23% in the quarter. Including transaction-related expenses, approximately 200 million of the increase was driven by quality carriers. Higher locomotive fuel prices were also a significant factor, up about 90 million versus last year. Partially offsetting these items, real estate gains were 56 million higher. Non-fuel inflation remains steady versus last quarter at around 3%. As I mentioned last time, we have some lagging contracts that may drive higher inflation going into next year. As Jamie discussed, we continue to focus on hiring and retaining train and engine employees. While head count was roughly flat sequentially, excluding the addition of quality carriers. The conductor count was up and was offset by reductions in other areas of the business. As a result, we experienced $16 million more in hiring and retention costs versus last year. You'll note that we have renamed the prior MS&O line to purchase services and other. The base expenses are identical to the prior MS&O category. But the new description better reflects the costs in this line post-acquisition. Increased costs on this line reflected the addition of quality, as well as higher intermodal terminal and locomotive expense. Depreciation was up on a higher asset base that also includes the acquisition impact. Finally, we're proud to report another all-time record for fuel efficiency in the quarter. This reflects continued focus and investment by CSX, demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and the ongoing environmental advantage of rail. Looking into the fourth quarter, we typically see a seasonal increase in operating expense due to weather, lower capitalized labor, as well as holidays and vacations, that trend should continue this year. In addition to expected headwinds from higher incentive compensation and lower sequential gains on property sales in the fourth quarter. Peak-season expenses are also likely to be higher than normal as a result of ongoing supply chain disruptions. Now, turning to cash flow on Slide 11. With operating income up 34% on a year-to-date basis. Free cash flow before dividends this year is $2.9 billion up nearly 50%. Free cash flow conversion on net income is exceeding 100% year-to-date. And we expect it to remain near this level on a full-year basis. The Company's cash balance of 2.2 billion is beginning to normalize. The lower balance reflects the acquisition in the quarter and a step-up in distributions to shareholders. We expect cash to continue to normalize over time. After fully funding capital investments in our core infrastructure, year-to-date shareholder returns have exceeded 2.9 billion, including approximately $2.3 billion in buybacks and over $600 million in dividends. We will continue to be balanced and opportunistic in our buyback approach, and we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim, for his closing remarks. James Foote : Great. Thank you, Sean. Concluding with Slide 12, we are maintaining a full-year outlook for double-digit revenue growth before the impact from quality carriers. We expect capital expenditures to be at the top end of our initial $1.7 to $1.8 billion range due to materials cost inflation, the capacity investments we just reviewed, and the inclusion of quality carrier\u2019s capital spending. I will conclude my remarks the same way I began. We are committed to helping our customers overcome the current supply chain challenges. And as you heard today, our entire team is aligned around this goal. And we will continue to act. We have a strong hiring pipeline, and we will hire until we have staffed the network to match demand. We expect to higher above attrition throughout the rest of this year and into next year. Economic demand remains strong and CSX will help customers capture that demand. Everything we do begins with a commitment to providing customers a high-quality service. We will build on the positive momentum from actions taken to date. We will continue putting resources in place to drive growth, and we will provide customers with creative new offerings that makes CSX a more meaningful part of the customer supply chain. Thank you, Bill. Bill Slater : Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time, I would ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question. With that, we will now take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter. Your line is open. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good afternoon. Congrats on some really solid results in a tough environment. Great to see. Maybe just a follow-up. Either Jim or Sean, just talking about your thoughts on pricing. I know you were running through some of the categories there. Maybe how much you can still address and some of the opportunities to catch this rising market, and obviously coal up 20%, it seems like you're touching some of that maybe even faster than thought, or there's different kind of moves, maybe just delve into the pricing outlook. Thanks. Sean Pelkey : Thank you. And I'll take a shot at this, Kevin. I think it's clear that cost inflation over the last year, expectations have risen and our arising in the next year. And this is not surprising to our customers are facing the same cost inflation pressures that we see. and what we strive to do is be transparent around that in our conversations with customers. Fourth quarter and first quarter are heavy renewal periods for us, so we'll be having those discussions. But the exciting part though, as we get into a higher inflation environment, is really the value proposition we offer. When a customer is looking to offset some of that cost inflation, rail is just a great alternative. They shift more of their volumes over to rail. And then you add on top of that the persistent driver shortages that we're likely to see well into next year and probably the years ahead, the value proposition is there. Then on top of that, the environmental discussions that we're having increasingly with customers is really resonating with those. It's no surprise. Cost inflation is higher than what we saw last year. It will be a higher-cost inflation environment than what we probably seen in the last number of years. And we've got to have conversations with our customers around that. Ken Hoexter : I guess, just a follow-up. Any detailed thoughts on kind of the trend of pure pricing, pace of acceleration, or any level of that detail? Sean Pelkey : Well we get to touch, as I mentioned, contracts into the fourth and first 2 quarter, that's a heavy renewal period and we will continue to have those discussions. I think I will probably leave it at that. Ken Hoexter : All right. Thank you very much, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra. Your line is unmuted. Amit Mehrotra : Thank you, operator. Hi, everybody. Kevin, can you just update us on the quality carriers\u2019 acquisition. The status of the revenue opportunity you're seeing converting some of those into chemical carloads. And just when we may see a more meaningful uplift, obviously that's a great offset to intermodal carloads [Indiscernible] growing just to [Indiscernible]it's a great idiosyncratic opportunity if you can just give us a little bit update there and then just any initial thoughts on margins or performance next year. Obviously, you've got a big pricing cycle ahead of you. Just any willingness to opine about. What the opportunities is from an OR perspective next year would be would be highly appreciated. Thanks. Kevin Boone : Maybe I'll let Sean take the OR question, but I don't think we're giving guidance today on next year. But on the quality carriers, as you'll remember that, that really is focused on our chemical franchise and the customer reception has been overwhelmingly positive in a market where supply is constrained. Our customers were looking for more options to move their freight, and so Randy and his team combined with our Transflo team have found a number of options and we're moving freight today. Now that we're doing it in a way where it's thoughtful and calculated, and that the customer's seeing a good service on that product, and we'll continue to build momentum in the market. But I think everything that we thought before we made the acquisition is coming true. The only thing I will say is from a conquipment standpoint, obviously with things tight right now, the equipment backlog is going to take a little bit long in the next year to really ramp that up. When we think about some of the ISO tank solutions that we're contemplating out there. So other than that, everything is full speed ahead. I would say there's customers that we believe would be longer -- would take a lot longer to adopt, that have been first to adopt, which is exciting for us markets leaders in the industry, and their adoption I think is going to really set the tone for this to really take off into the market. The other thing that I think is positive is shows other partners that we have that we're capable of doing this using the Transflo solution in unique ways. And we don't always have to do it ourselves. We would love partners to continue to bring freight and through our all of our different capabilities that we have so I think that momentum is starting to be seen in the market as well. Amit Mehrotra : Sean, do you want to talk about the [Indiscernible] -- Maybe you can offer guidance, but maybe another way to ask it is -- there's obviously a lag on this coal. Coal revenue are to opportunities. Just wondering, are we going to see more uplift in coal yields in the fourth quarter as you -- as some of that lag gets caught up? Just talk to us maybe about the cadence because you don't want to answer though our question next year. Sean Pelkey : Yeah, on the -- clearly on the export coal side, you've seen some favorability on the prices there. And as we've mentioned before, our prices tied to the benchmarks and you will see some favorability sequentially in the fourth quarter versus third quarter. It's a strong market. We continue to see favorability in the next year, how long it holds up at these levels that probably weren't held here. But these are extremely elevated levels that will probably carry into next year and hopefully create some favorability there. But it's a -- everybody is trying to produce more coal and we're trying to move more of it today. And at the mine, there's been some struggles here in the third quarter as you could see with some of the production hiccups that some of the producers have had. We're working through that as diligently as we can and really ramping up our ability to serve those customers. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Thank you very much, appreciate the time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz. Your line is unmuted. Tom Wadewitz : Good afternoon. I think this is probably for you Kevin, but maybe for others also. How do you think about the impact of capacity constraints on volumes? You think intermodal would have been meaningfully stronger, do you -- how much optimism do you have as you look forward that maybe into '22 that capacity constraints get alleviated quickly, and how does that inform your perspective on growth looking to next year? Is it reasonable to expect easing of constraints and a pretty good acceleration? I guess it's primarily around your remodel, but you may have capacity constrains other areas as well. Thank you. James Foote : Hey, Tom, it's Jim. Let me take a shot. I would say yeah, we're clearly constrained. There was more business out there this quarter, there has been more business out there throughout this year that we could not handle. The primary reason for that is our inability, like everyone else in the world right now, to ramp up our workforce coming out of the steep declines of the early phases of the pandemic. And as Jamie talked about, we're now starting to see the fruits of all of our hard work for the last 9 months or more, and are beginning to bring on more people and actually deploy those people into the field so we're able to operate a little bit better. And we fully expect that that trend will continue as we go forward, unless some other crazy curve ball gets thrown at us. And being a much, much better position as we exit this year and move into next year, and hopefully be able to take advantage of what seems to be a continuation of strong demand for transportation services into 2022, I know some people are even saying 2023. Tom Wadewitz : Do you think a lot of that is in your control or is it hard to have visibility given the warehouse labor, drayage labor, other pieces? James Foote : My first -- the number 1 priority is getting enough CSX employees in the training -- principally conductors on the train so we can operate more fluidly and get back to some of the performance metrics that we were putting up pre -pandemic in the end of 2019 and beginning of 2020. The fluidity, the dwell, the on-time performance, the customer service metrics that we put out there, the trip plan compliance numbers, those numbers are all down, and that's principally a result of our having an extremely difficult time getting people to come to work for us. It's taken a complete I would say reengineering of the hiring process, a complete review of everything that we do when we onboard employees for us to get to this point. This is -- this has been extremely difficult we're no different than every -- every business at least in the U.S, every business I think. Every business, every hospital, every school, everybody is struggling with the same phenomenon of trying to get people to come to work. I am confident that we have done everything we can do right now and are seeing that numbers are increasing. In terms of the number of employees that we can put into our training programs and begin to qualify them to go to work. Like I said, unless something else comes along that disrupts that process, I hope we're going to be in a lot better shape at the end of this year, the beginning of next year than we have been over the last 9 months. Tom Wadewitz : Great. Thanks for the insights, Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long. Justin Long : Thanks, and good afternoon. Sean, I think you called out a few sequential headwinds to OpEx in the fourth-quarter. I believe it was incentive comp, slower gains on sale, and then some peak season expense. Any way you can put a finer point around those 3 items to just help us understand the order of magnitude here in the next quarter? Sean Pelkey : Yeah. Thanks, Justin. You got the items right; higher incentive comp, lower gains on property sales, and then just some additional costs related to the supply chain. If you put all those together, you're probably looking at about a couple of pennies over and above what we would normally see from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Justin Long : Okay. Very helpful. And then any thoughts on other revenue as well? I know it was pretty elevated and took a decent step up here sequentially X quality, but the thoughts on that into the fourth quarter and maybe in the next year? Sean Pelkey : If you look just at the pure other revenue line, not considering the tracking revenue line which should -- tracking revenue should be pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter, really the big driver, as Kevin said there, is the intermodal storage and premise use charges as well as demurrage. And that's a direct result of what's going on in the supply chain that we've been talking about here. So as things start to improve, that line -- the other revenue line will come down. But here we sit in October, we're probably in about the same place as we are -- we were in Q3. And we'll see where it goes from here. Justin Long : Okay. I appreciate the time. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group. Your line is open. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Afternoon, guys. Just back on headcount. If you can get all the people that you'd like to get, I guess, 2 thoughts. One, how much -- it sounds like you want to be above attrition directionally. What kind of percentage increases in headcount are you thinking about, and is there a way to think about if you add back 5% to headcount, what do you think that means to volume growth and things like that? Do you still think you can grow volume in excess of headcount? Just to understand the spreads there, and thanks. Thank you. Sean Pelkey : Yes, Scott. So, what we're looking on a sequential basis is modest increases in headcount, right? We're bringing on -- trying to fill classes of 40 every week and then getting those folks trained up and out into the field. So, you're not going to see dramatic increases in headcount. I think it's also fair to assume that we've got capacity still on our existing trains and capacity on the network, so we are hiring for growth, but it's not -- it doesn't need to be one for one. Scott Group : Okay. So, I didn't -- I probably didn't ask it so well, but do you think next year is a year where you could grow volume and excess of headcount? Sean Pelkey : I don't see any reason why that wouldn't be the target. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. James Foote : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Oglenski. Your line is open. Brandon Oglenski : Hey guys, it's Brandon. I just want to ask a quick one about the fourth quarter cost commentary. I guess, I don't know if it was already asked, but does that mean that's going to be hard to show OR implemented in the near-term. Then I guess longer-term if I could sneak a two-part question. Kevin, what are some the structural things that you think you can leverage with the headcount, building off of Scott's question there? Sean Pelkey : Yeah. Just on the OR question, we -- we're not going to give OR guidance, but I think it's fair to assume sequentially, given some of the cost pressures as well as just the normal seasonality, we'll probably see an OR that's a little bit higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. Kevin Boone : Brandon, I guess the question was, what can we do with more headcount? The team is going to -- Brandon Oglenski : Yeah, strategically. Kevin Boone : Strategically, we're going to move a lot more freight. When we talk to customers right now, they 're are looking for capacity, and they're trying to offset a lot of cost inflation too. The environment couldn't be any better for us to go out and sell the product we have. So, we're going to move more freight and we're going to get more wallet share with the customer. It's a perfect environment for us. Brandon Oglenski : All right, thanks, Kevin. Thanks, Sean. Operator : Your next line comes from the question -- your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck. Your line is open. Brian Ossenbeck : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Jamie just wanted to ask if bigger picture question about just capacity and interplay with the regulators in DC. See what your peers put out there later this week and next week. But it looks like you have some obviously, a lot of capacity solutions here that you're ramping up on your own. Do you think you need additional help on that for some of your supply chain partners, and maybe some perspective on what you can do on your own versus where you need help with? And then just contrasting that with obviously the big other revenue you just mentioned, clearly the demurrage is a cost everybody at this point, but there have been some fairly pointed comments out of the STB about growing and focusing maybe less on OR than on growth. So maybe you can address all that in terms of adding capacity if need help. And what the regulators you think will take away from all this? Thank you. James Foote : I think Kevin did a very good job of outlining all of the activities that we've been undertaking here over the last 6 months or so to do on our own without any prodding to improve and increase capacity. We were way ahead of the curve. The -- Chicago, the biggest terminal for us in terms of intermodal capacity, expanding our 59th Street facility, we bought that property two years ago. We had it -- we had another yard right down the street, which was ready to go, cranes available. So, we've always tried to be somewhat visionary in trying to determine where the growth would be and make sure that we were properly positioned. Some of these new initiatives, like Kevin talked about moving traffic inland from Savannah into a facility in Atlanta, we had a yard available there, wasn't an intermodal yard, we created an intermodal yard. And so, we're taking the steps that we think are appropriate and necessary in order to make sure that our railroad continues to operate more fluid and provide better service all the time. That's always been the case, it will always be the case, and that's -- whether that's mainline track that moves merchandise, business, or whatever it is, we're always being thoughtful in our planning process to make sure that we have the capacity available to handle a traffic growth as it comes on. The lucky fact is that we over the last 4 years, by changing the methodologies we use to run the railroad, have freed up an enormous amount of capacity across the rail network, just simply by running the trains on a more reliable and efficient manner. And so, we don't need to make big, big, big investments in the railroad in order to handle future growth. We've you got locomotives in storage, so we're ready to go. I had thought, I believe it was on a year-end conference call in January, where I called out the fact that we were going to be hiring. I fully believed, in as much as at that point in time we had about 300 of our trainees and service employees off one COVID, that we would just simply do what we've always done; we'd hire 500 employees. The 300 employees would come back from off sick, and we'd be rocking and rolling and we've been moving freight. No one -- no one ever gave me a heads up that says, by the way when you want to hire somebody, nobody is going to want to work for you. Plus, all the people that you head furloughed as the railroad had this trafficked decline so dramatically. So many more than was usual when we call them back and said you want to come back to work they said no, I've decided to go do something else. I've changed my lifestyle. I'm going to go enjoy the scenery on the Jersey course -- coast or whatever it might be. This is not a phenomenon that is unique to CSX. This is a phenomenon that nobody saw coming, and it is a phenomenon that everybody in the supply chain, whether you're a trucker, whether your steamship Company, whether you're a port, whether you're a warehouse operator, whatever you do, this is a phenomenon that is impacting everyone and everyone is trying to deal with this -- what is now the new norm. So, we've had to change everything the way we think about it, and that's -- but have done that. As we always do, we adapted, we recognized this -- the situation, we adapted and we made changes, and that's why we're reasonably confident that we'll be in better shape as we move forward this year and in pretty good shape as we move in to next year. I don't need the -- I don't need any help from the government in order to figure out what I'm supposed to do, I just don't want to make sure the government does something that screws it up worse. Brian Ossenbeck : Understood. Thanks, Jim, and if I could sneak one quick one in, all the stuff on Page 6, do you think that would be permanent going into the future of these things you had pulled forward from prior plans, or do you think this is more of a case of reacting to what we see here? Thank you. James Foote : I think we're -- what we're doing is we're responding the situation, that's simple as that. We can think, we can plan, we can do all kinds of things. Unfortunately, I think we've had more black swan events in the last 2 years than most people would experience in a lifetime. So, as I said, what's the next thing? I am -- I started off my remarks telling -- saying how proud I was of our employees. All of this going on, all of these challenges, all of these changes, all of these demands, all of these people saying first of all Jesus, you know, the entire supply chain issue was as a result of the railroads. Oh my God, the railroads screwed this thing up. Then as time went on, everybody figured out it's not really the railroads. We don't own the warehouses where this stuff goes, we don't have the trucks to bring it there. If I need to buy a truck and bring it there, I'll bring it there and I'll put the box in the warehouse parking lot, going to be somebody else's problem. But most of the issues associated with everything that is talked about, the railroads are doing an extremely good job. Their employees have been critical of workers throughout the entire pandemic have been out there working, and not been home in the basement, have been complying with all the requirements and making sure that the economy keeps growing. And so, the railroad guys, not just CSX, but could be entire railroad industry's been an up phenomenal job under unbelievably difficult circumstances. Brian Ossenbeck : Thank you, Jim. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee. Your line is open. Christian Wetherbee : Thanks, afternoon, guys. Jim, I think you mentioned on the call that the quality impact was more than 200 basis points on the operating ratio, and so I guess it sort of struck me that you guys are running sort of the core rail business at an operating ratio I really haven't seen before. And I guess in the context, and I understand the pricing environment, particularly on the assessorial side is certainly elevated, and that probably has some impact on how we should be thinking about operating ratio. But maybe big picture as we think forward. You are growing volume arguably better than your peers, pricing is going to be a cycle here for a period of time, and you're talking about bringing some folks back, but service is good. Can we talk a little bit about maybe we need to think about a new way to think about OR over the long run? I guess I just want to make sure I understand what this business is capable of in terms of incremental margins and the ability to take on some of these new freights and these new opportunities, what seems to be very, very good margins going forward. James Foote : Yup, you did the math, and yeah, that was excluding some of the transaction costs and some other things too. So, it's pretty simple math. Yeah, the railroad is running efficiently. When we stretch, as we've always said this a million, million times. This is not about all OR, this is not about how low can we go, how many heads can we take out. When we run the railroad good, when we stretch, like we're doing right now, and the reason we're stretching is because we're trying every single hour of every single day to move our customers' freight. And when you do that, and you've focused on getting it there as quickly as you can and efficiently as you can. It results in unfortunately not a perfect service product, but a very good service product in difficult times. You do it efficiently. And as a result of that, the score adds up that's says you got a low operating ratio, but that's not the goal that's just a result. And so yes, we run up a pretty good number. I would've preferred to do a lot more business as we said, we could have. And we try to do every single day, we try to move more freight. Kevin is out there right now, constantly trying to figure out how you can provide solutions to our customers. Our goal here is to move more freight. That's what we do. We move freight, and the more freight we move, the more revenue you pour in the top, the more efficiently you operate is simple is that, it's just math. So, think about what they -- think about, you want to worry about what the operating ratio was? Think about what the operating ratio could be for the railroad industry if they were able to grow more than it's historically grown. Then you can start talking about what the operating ratios might be, stop thinking about how much cost you can take out. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. That's helpful color, thanks very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors. Your line is open. Bascome Majors : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Jim, as you alluded to earlier, you've been talking about hiring to support growth since January. Certainly, doubled down that on that in July and it's been a big topic today. But at this point, it doesn't feel like our U.S. competitors are talking as much about labor and some of the challenges there that they're having as you are today. And maybe why that's a messaging difference rather than a fundamental difference. You've got a letter from the STB on Monday, about CSX service specifically. So, can you help us understand, is there something different with your situation with labor versus your other public peers in the U.S.? Is it the messaging difference, just anything to help us unscramble this would be helpful? Thank you. James Foote : Yeah well, I'm trying to unscramble it for myself, and I've said from the very beginning of this year, that we had a challenge in terms of hiring. We needed to hire, I thought we would be able to hire like we always had. We aren't able to hire like we always did, and we've said that now for 3 quarters. You have my metrics as reported to the STB in terms of all of the railroads, whether it'd be velocity, whether it'd be dwell, my service metrics are continuing to lead in most areas. So, the railroad here is still running better than most. During that period of time, where we were finding out that a lot of people wanted to make career choices and leave the Company that we hadn't expected, we were having the difficulties that everybody else was having during that period of time. We were the epicenter of the world in terms of the pandemic here in Jacksonville. So, I think we got probably hit during that period of time a little more severely the states of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi have had a little rougher time, and I'm not calling out any reasons why that might be, that's just the facts. And so, while we have been saying publicly, we are hiring as fast, aggressively anyone right now that will want to come and work here during the midst of the worst of the pandemic in the world ongoing in our service territory. And yeah, guess what? I got a letter. Well, the STB takes in complaints from customers and they relay them to me. They will respond, they're just doing a job, we will respond. I found it a little unfortunate that under the circumstances of everything we're doing based upon what our overall service metrics show our performance to be based upon how the STB measures us in terms of how we operate, that we got the letter. But I'm a big boy, I've been around. We'll deal with it, we'll respond, we'll work with the regulator and our customers to try and address the -- any customer issues. The letter is posted. If you can figure out who the customer is that's having a problem from the letter, I don't know why they just don't call me. I tell every customer I meet, I give them my business card, I give them my cellphone number. I say if you've got an issue, give me a call. And Jamie Boychuk 's the same way. So, I wish they just call me if there is a challenge. Bascome Majors : Thanks for the candid response, Jim. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Jon Chappell. Your line is open. Jonathan Chappell : Good afternoon. We kept -- theme of the earnings season's been pricing power, and obviously there's things like accessorial that are helping intermodal, but your whole core business has been kind of reset a bit higher on the revenue per carload front. So, the question is, what's the stickiness of some of these pricing increases that have gone in, and where is the total portfolio set on a contractual basis as we think about maybe the ability to push pricing higher this quarter too? Kevin Boone : Look, gotten a couple of pricing questions already, and I am going to stick to the scripts for the most part, it's a discussion we're having with our customers. We\u2019re being transparent around the cost pressures that we face that we expect to cover those costs. We also want to talk about volume growth with our customers, wallet share, and all those other things. We do have parts of our business that you are well aware of, coal, which moves with the benchmark prices. we have seen some favorability there. We participate when our customers are participating at a good market. And obviously when those markets come down, we participate on the other side as well. Intermodal businesses, some other parts of our business are tied directly to inflation metrics, and those have moved up. And so, we'll see some favorability in those parts of our business that are tied to that end of season. Those will continue to probably flow through into the fourth quarter and in the next year. So, we'll have some momentum there. And then obviously, this is probably our expectations for inflation in the next year or higher than the previous year, last year. And so, we'll have those discussions and price -- price accordingly. I'll probably leave it at that. Jonathan Chappell : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl. Your line is open. Jason Seidl : Thank you, Operator. Afternoon, gentlemen, and congratulations on that impressive OR. I wanted to drill down a little bit on a comment you made about some on-shoring production due to supply chain issues. Is that a one-off customer? Is this a trend you're seeing? And then also, are you having customers coming to you telling you that they might change sort of how they run their inventories in the future? Kevin Boone : Absolutely. There's -- I can think of multiple industries right now. And you've seen some announcements from some large producers out there that are making incremental investments and U.S. production. I think they're looking at the volatility and how much -- how costly it is to get freight from overseas. Labor is less of a component in some of these production facilities than it's ever been, so that labor differential moving in here to U.S. this doesn't matter as much. It's more about having availability to the inventory and the onshore phenomenon I hope has legs here. We're seeing early signs of that. You've seen some big announcements, I hope we'll see some further announcements coming forward. And we talked about this with the energy renaissance here a number of years ago, when we had cheap energy with gas and oil, and fracking, had that not never materialized, I think this time, in my opinion, could be different. I think all the things are starting to align for our customers and others to reconsider where they want to have production, and more balanced that they don't run into the same issues that they 're having currently. Jason Seidl : And in terms of total inventories carried, are you seeing a change there as well? Kevin Boone : I certainly think there's more -- customers are reevaluating forward positioning inventory levels. We're having those discussions around our Transflo products. So, they don't need next-day shipping or things like that, their forward positioning, those things so they can make sure that their production facilities remain up and running. That's very, very important. So, all of these factors are, I think, playing into investments that we'll see customer to make over the next couple of years. Jason Seidl : Kevin, I appreciate the color. And gentlemen, thanks for the time as always. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan. Your line is open. Benjamin Nolan : Hey, thanks, guys. I appreciate you filling me in here. I guess I wanted to -- we talked a lot about labor and some of the issues that are impacting there. But just thinking about maybe the opportunity to actually get a little bit more volume through. And specifically, we talked about coal, but curious what your customers are talking about with respect to further ramp up there. And also, on the intermodal side, we've seen some of the steamships diverting cargoes away from Savannah, for instance, to get into Jacksonville or other places on the east coast trying to fit more -- more volume through the system. But I guess the question is, how capable are you of accommodating some of these things? Kevin Boone : [Indiscernible] You see in the East Coast ports outgrow the West Coast ports for the net -- last number of years. That's going to continue to ongoing. Savannah is making significant investments. All the ports that we operate into our making investments to be able to handle that. We're well-positioned, whether it's Savannah, Charleston, Jacksonville Tampa, all of those locations are areas where we have the ability to serve. So, we're ready to take on that volume. We made some investments. Our intermodal network, continues to be the best network in the East operationally. There is no question around that. You just look at the service metrics, look at the growth we've been able to handle that better than anybody else. And we'll continue to leverage that product into the market. Benjamin Nolan : Sure. So, there's not -- there is no near-term inhabitant to being able to get more volume through some of the network then I guess, is the question. James Foote : We talked about all the capacity. Clearly we have the rail capacity, we're well-positioned with all of the ports, and again, it's not just the international steamship companies that are coming, there's plastics, imports, exports, there's a lot of merchandise business, old business that we move through these ports as well, so yeah, we're working with them through the transload facilities, either our own facilities are partnering with people who are building big, big, big transload facilities on the -- along the coast, to be able to handle the capacity, and we clearly, as I said earlier, have 30% boom on the railroad to handle the traffic without making any more big investments. Benjamin Nolan : All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman. Your line is open. Jeffrey Kauffman : Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in, and congratulations. Just some questions for Kevin. I'm trying to get used to my model with quality carriers out here. Your non-locomotive fuel expense was up about 38 million year-on-year. How much of that was attributable to the inclusion of quality? Sean Pelkey : Just a little over 20 million. Jeffrey Kauffman : Okay. And just one other net, the depreciation that was up about 19 million sequentially. About how much of that would've been attributable to quality? Sean Pelkey : Jeff, it's Sean again. Yeah, about half of that is related to quality. We'll see that impact carry forward. Jeffrey Kauffman : Okay. That's all I have. Congratulations. Terrific quarter. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time, and this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 2021 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Matthew Korn, you may begin your conference. Matthew Korn : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Sean Pelkey, Acting Chief Financial Officer. In our presentation, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. And with that, it's my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim? James Foote : Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us for today's call. First, I'm pleased to welcome Matthew to CSX, and believe his investment and research background, including coverage of many of our customers, will make him a great contributor to our team, and I wish Bill success in his new role as Head of Finance and Treasury. As we exit 2021, every CSX employee deserves recognition for their dedication to our customers in what has been another unbelievable year operating through the ongoing impacts of the pandemic and supply chain disruptions. As these challenges continue into the start of the New Year, we continue to take the necessary steps to move more freight for our customers. We are putting the resources in place to deliver a high-quality service product and are working hard every day to make rail a meaningful part of our customers' transportation solutions. Throughout this period, we have remained true to our core principles, operate safely, reliably and efficiently and are committed to providing customers with additional capacity to help overcome the current challenges. These actions, combined with expected easing of supply chain disruptions, positions CSX for growth. Turning to our presentation, let's start with Slide 4, which highlights our key financial results. We moved nearly 1.6 million carloads in the fourth quarter and generated over $3.4 billion in revenue. Operating income increased by 12% to $1.37 billion. The operating ratio increased 310 basis points to 60.1%, which includes approximately 250 basis points from the impact from Quality Carriers and 50 basis points from higher fuel prices, and earnings per share increased 27% to $0.42 a share. I'll now turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for details. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue increased 21% year-over-year with growth across all major lines of business. Merchandise revenue increased 4% on 3% lower volume as the impact of ongoing automotive semiconductor shortages was more than offset by revenue growth across all other merchandise markets. Industrial and construction-related end markets continued to demonstrate the strongest growth. Even though declines in energy-related markets remain a headwind for our chemical business, it\u2019s important to highlight that our core chemical, plastics and waste markets continued to show solid year-over-year growth. Intermodal revenue increased 16% on flat volumes as international growth driven by strong underlying demand and continued growth in rail volumes from East Coast ports was offset by domestic declines into ongoing driver and equipment shortages. Coal revenue increased 39% on 2% lower volume. Increases in export coal shipments, driven by the impact of rising benchmark prices, was partially offset by the effect of declines in domestic volumes, largely related to producer outages. Other revenue increased primarily due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage, driven by supply chain disruptions, resulting from truck driver shortages, chassis availability and the lack of warehouse capacity. As we exited the fourth quarter, we clearly saw the effects of Omicron, with December volumes impacted by labor and supply chain disruptions. These challenges have continued into the New Year where we are seeing customers face labor shortages in their operations. As we look across merchandise, intermodal and coal markets, demand signals remain strong. As supply chain challenges normalize, we would expect volumes to align more with demand. Finally, I would like to highlight the positive results we have achieved by working with customers on new business development projects. Over the last few months, we have seen three significant announcements of new production of facilities to be located on CSX Railroad, including two electric vehicle plants and a new steel mill. These projects are team effort and show the ability of sales and marketing team and partnership with operations to creatively come up with solutions that meet the requirements of our customers. Importantly, these projects represent significant long-term value to CSX. Now let's discuss the progress CSX is making when it comes to our commitment to sustainability as summarized on Slide 6. Rail is the most efficient form of land-based transportation and CSX is the most fuel-efficient Class 1 railroad, U.S. Class 1 railroad. By using CSX Rail in 2021, our customers avoided 11 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which is equivalent to taking 2.3 million passenger vehicles off the road, an amount greater than all the hybrid and electric vehicles operating in the U.S. today. We are proud of the recognition we have received for these efforts to date by organizations such as CDP, Dow Jones, and Forbes, but we are certainly not done. CSX continues to invest in existing technologies to drive further improvement and we continue to evaluate emerging technologies, so we are prepared to realize those benefits when available. We are excited to see our customers increase focus on improving their carbon footprint. Customer engagement on ESG has accelerated and then we have seen them double their usage of CSX provided tools that help them calculate emissions savings from switching to rail. You will also see later this quarter, we will be recognizing customers for their efforts in prioritizing carbon emission savings by converting traditional truck volume to rail. I will now pass it on to Jaime to discuss our operations. Jamie Boychuk : All right. Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. As Jim referenced, we are working very hard to provide customers the capacity to help overcome the persistent supply chain challenges. One of the areas we have discussed in our ongoing T&E hiring initiatives, this effort is beginning to pay dividends as more employees finish training and begin moving freight. We are also encouraged to see ongoing hiring momentum at the start of the year as we continue to consistently fill weekly training classes, while maintaining a strong pipeline of candidates. In total, we roughly doubled the average number of active trainees in the quarter. Also, the number of employees qualifying and moving to active status increased almost 50% sequentially in the fourth quarter to approximately 150. And we expect this number to double to over 300 employees in the first quarter. Recently, the benefit of these additional employees have been offset by the rapid rise in COVID cases across the network. Average daily cases have increased by several 100 employees since early November and are approaching prior peak levels. That said, there is no doubt that the hiring actions taken to date have allowed us to better manage the current situation. We have also supplemented this hiring by bringing additional assets online to help offset network imbalance caused by pockets of concentrated case counts. We will maintain these tactical asset increases as needed to protect service. We will look to improve asset utilization and drive increased operating efficiency as employees return to work and our ongoing hire initiatives provide the necessary resources to move incremental volumes and deliver the expected high-quality service to our customers. Additionally, until along the way capacity improves in intermodal terminals, we will continue making the necessary investments to keep terminals fluid by providing the overflow space and supplemental labor required to move long dwelling boxes out of our terminals. We're also continuing to take a long term approach to network and infrastructure planning, and have identified several strategic exciting extension opportunities that will provide additional long-term capacity by helping to alleviate congestion, while also supporting growth for years to come. As always, we will pursue these initiatives while maintaining a balanced train plan and a continued focus on strong execution to maximize both reliability and service for our customers. I want to thank the entire operating team for their hard work and long hours they've put in to keep freight moving for our customers. Despite the incremental headwinds this quarter, service metrics remained consistent with the prior quarter and we are taking the necessary steps to drive these metrics back towards pre-pandemic levels over the course of 2022. Turning to Slide 8, safety remains fundamental to everything we do at CSX and we hold ourselves to the highest standard for our employees, customers, and the communities in which we work and operate. Our hard work to instill a culture of safety at CSX continues to drive positive results, as shown by the reduction in our train accident headcount this -- train accident rate this year. Heading into 2022, we continue to target further reductions in human factor incidents through a combination of increased awareness, best practice sharing, collaboration across regions, and expanding our successful drone program. We are also engaging with our new hires to instill our principles of safe operations and emphasize our commitment to make CSX the safest running railroad. I will now hand it to Sean to review our financial results. Sean Pelkey : Thank you, Jamie and good afternoon. As you've heard, operating income grew double digits up $151 million, with revenue up 21% on gains across all major markets. Over the line, interest and other expense was $60 million favorable, reflecting the prior year debt repurchase expense. Income taxes were up on higher pretax income though we recognized $25 million in benefits this quarter, primarily related to state tax adjustments. As a result, EPS of $0.42 is up 27% versus the prior year. Now, I'd like to take a minute to walk through operating expense in more detail on the next slide. Total costs increased $451 million or 28% in the quarter. the addition of Quality Carriers drove approximately $200 million of the increase. Higher fuel prices were also a significant factor driving costs up to about $115 million versus last year. Non-locomotive fuel inflation remained consistent with prior quarters just above 3%, though as we turn the page to 2022, we expect a number around 4%. Drilling into a few specific line items, labor and fringe increased $115 million or 20% in the quarter. Quality was about $30 million. Incentive compensation was a nearly $40 million headwind in the quarter, largely due to higher expected payouts versus last year, and the impact of accelerated expense for certain employees. As Jamie discussed, we continue to focus on hiring and retaining train and engine employees. We invested over $20 million in new programs targeting our T&E workforce. In line with these efforts, average headcount increased by 230, or 1% sequentially. Labor inflation remained in line with prior quarters, though is expected to be slightly higher in 2022. Purchase services and other expense increased $198 million or 44% in the quarter. As a reminder, this is where most of the quality expense shows up, approximately $130 million. Also, you may recall that we expected investments in supply chain fluidity to result in higher costs on this line and we saw about $45 million of increased expense as we work tirelessly to drive network and terminal fluidity in light of unprecedented challenges. We expect these costs will persist until we see a normalization of labor and the broader supply chain. The remaining increase reflected both the impact of inflation as well as a number of smaller items. Depreciation was up 4% on a higher asset base. Fuel costs were up on higher price and trucking fuel. Rents were up slightly, and we had about $20 million of higher real estate gains. Going forward, you can expect a modest level of base real estate gains, similar to the $35 million we recognized in 2020 as we shift our focus towards leveraging the real estate portfolio to support growth initiatives. However, the Virginia transaction will continue to impact results in 2022 with a $20 million gain in Q1, and a $120 million gain expected in Q2. We anticipate receiving the final $125 million of cash in Q4. Now turning to cash flow on Slide 11. On a full year basis free cash flow before dividends increased 45% to $3.8 billion. As a reminder, this includes $400 million from Virginia, and over 500 million of total proceeds from property dispositions. Cash in short term investments finished the year at $2.3 billion. While this remains elevated, we nevertheless expect to continue to work the balance down this year levels more in line with our historical liquidity needs. After fully funding capital investments, shareholder returns exceeded $3.7 billion. We will continue to be balanced and opportunistic in our buyback approach and we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. James Foote : Great, thanks, Sean. Let's conclude with our outlook for the year on Slide 13. We remain optimistic about the opportunity to grow this year, driven by a combination of strong underlying economic momentum and supply chain recovery. Based on these expected tailwinds, we are targeting GDP plus volume growth for the year. Volume should build sequentially throughout the year as supply chain bottlenecks ease. As a result, growth in the second half of the year is expected to be greater than in the first half. This growth will be supported by the initiative Jamie reviewed to appropriately resource our network for the current demand environment and to ensure we can provide customers with a consistently strong service product. We also expect pricing to benefit from a combination of market forces including very strong demand for transportation services. Full year capital expenditures are planned at approximately $2 billion. Our top capital priority is and always has been maintaining and improving the safety and reliability of our network. In 2022, we will replace an excess of 500 miles of rail as we continue to focus on the core infrastructure. The cost of this capital work has been offset by significant improvements in the efficiency of our engineering programs. While we expect to drive further efficiencies in 2022, our plan reflects the impact of increased inflation and a number of discrete strategic investment opportunities. We will continually evaluate future strategic opportunities as they come along, but still have ample capacity across our network to absorb future volume growth. And finally, after investing in the railroad and high return growth projects, we remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. We are entering the year with strong demand across the economy, but shippers are facing ongoing challenges and the lack of capacity in labor, materials and transportation. Our focus remains supporting our customers by providing effective rail solutions to overcome these persistent bottlenecks. As I said earlier, we are encouraged by the progress we are making and we expect our actions combined with improving global supply chain will provide a year of steadily improving growth. Thank you. And I'll turn it back to Matthew for questions. Matthew Korn : Thanks, Jim. Now, in the interest of time, I'd ask that everyone please limit yourselves to one question. And with that, operator, we will now take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is now open. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good afternoon, everyone, and congrats, Matt. I guess you guys didn't provide any discussion on forward profitability or margins and I get it. You have the lapping of Quality Carriers, plus lower land sale gains. So I guess, can you talk to the core efficiencies in the business and how you plan to leverage growth this year? Are there incremental opportunities for you guys to drive core profitability in outlook [ph] higher? Sean Pelkey : Yes, thanks, Brandon. This is Sean. So just to clear the record, so you're going into full year 2022, we're going to have the full year impact of Quality and have lower real estate gains, as I just outlined, that together is about a 350 basis point impact. So on a like-for-like basis, you're starting at a 59 OR. Fundamentally, nothing has really changed about our story, right? Our expectation, as we come out of the pandemic this year, is for supply chains to normalize. As they do that, some of this - some of the costs that we've added in order to better serve our customers will start to come down a little bit. Obviously, the incremental growth that we see, stronger in the second half than in the first half of the year, should be at good incremental margins. And so at the end of the day, I think the core story that you've seen over the last couple of years with us is the same next year or this year, as it's been. The only unknown is what's the pace of the normalization? How do we get -- how quickly do we overcome what we're seeing right now out there in the environment. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Brian Ossenbeck : All right. Thanks. Good evening. I just wanted to ask, Kevin, maybe you can go through some of the puts and takes of the outlook for some of the key end markets? I know Sean just talked about some of the uncertainty around the supply chains. But where do you feel like you have some maybe more opportunities that could come to bear and where you see some of the challenges? And then if you can layer in some of the impact of those new business development wins, it sounds like they might be a little bit more longer dated, but is it too early to see some benefit from those? Kevin Boone : Yes, thanks, Brian. Look, there's a lot of demand tail winds that we see. There's pretty robust demand across pretty much every end market currently, so we're optimistic there. As Sean pointed out that supply chain challenges and I think the timing of those normalizing is probably the biggest question as we move into second, third or fourth quarter kind of when does that really translate into some more, better fluidity out there for us. But starting with merchandise, really, it's a story of auto, when did the autos really start to -- production really start to come back online. When you look at our current estimates, it's really for a back half story on the volume and certainly autos drives more than just the current car loads in the auto side such as the metals business, plastics business for us as well. So auto is going to be very, very important. Certainly, we all know the demand. We've all been to the local dealership and they do not have any new cars. If you want a new car you've probably got to wait 12 months, so that's - the demand is there. There is no question about it. What we see right now, the metals business is very strong. Plastics remains very, very strong. Probably the only thing that we're really seeing weak and I touched on a little bit is the energy market and then that's all about spreads. And spreads can collapse and then get out again, so we'll continue to watch those and we'll benefit if those get more positive in the future. On the intermodal side, we've really benefitted from the international market and we see no slowdown at this point. There's still a lot of ships waiting at the port to get in and we've been very successful in moving that freight and we continue to have the operations and I think we'll continue to benefit from that. The domestic side is really where we've seen a disruption and that's been largely due to the driver shortage, the equipment shortages that we're seeing on the chassis side. And to be honest, I think the chassis problem seems to be being pushed out every month. I know the suppliers are having a hard time ramping up production, but that's probably going to be a second half story in terms of the chassis as far as we see it right now. So - but we do see the underlying demand there and I think that's a good positive story for us into the back half of the year. And then finally, when moving to the coal. The demand is outstripping supply. You see it in the exports benchmark prices, they are incredibly strong right now. We\u2019re at an all-time highs almost and when you look at the net and thermal markets today. And so we have some opportunity there. The mines had struggled quite frankly. They are underinvested. They had a hard time ramping back up production. Some have dealt with strikes. Some have dealt with other problems. And so those things should normalize hopefully and we should see the benefit of that. We've also seen recently a new mine come on line and so that should help us as we get through the year. But those, I think the biggest question is how long do the export prices stay at this levels? But we would expect hopefully volumes to pick up as we move through the year. Those are some of the moving parts due to the markets. Brian Ossenbeck : All right. Thanks, Kevin. If I can ask for just a quick comment on coal inventory levels. Do you think you can see some restocking given some of the dynamics you talked about with demand outstripping supply specifically on the domestic utility side? Kevin Boone : Yes, coal levels, particularly in our Southern utilities are very low. So there's restocking as needed. We're working really closely with our customers, and I would expect that to persist through this year and probably in the next. Brian Ossenbeck : All right. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is now open. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask you a bit about how closely we should tie your own capacity and your growth in conductors coming out of the training classes. It seems like you have a nice pipeline and a nice ramp up in that. How closely should we tie that volume growth to that ramp in your capacity? And is that the right way to think about it? Or do you think that the factors outside of your control in broader supply chain are kind of a bigger variable in terms of your volume growth? James Foote : Tom, it's Jim. Just generally, clearly, CSX is no different than any other industry right now, where we have been challenged finding people to come to work. And because we have been short on our train and engine service employees, simple fact is we have not been able to move the amount of freight we could have, had we've been staffed up at the appropriate levels. That's why we've been talking for the last year at least about our attempts to try and ramp up the hiring of operating employees. And as Jamie said, we're starting now just now after 12 months of very, very hard work to get it back to a positive growth number in terms of the number of employees. And when we do that, we'll be able to move more freight. Jamie, do you want to add more detail? Jamie Boychuk : Yes. I think Jim pretty much nailed it. This is probably one of the most difficult environments we've ever seen. When you think about all the stuff the rail industry has gone through over the past 10, 20 years, my 25 years of railroading, I can tell you, when you come in one week and you've got 60 people off on COVID a new variant comes through, and you've got 350 off on COVID on your T&E side, you really start to feel the effects. And believe me, Kevin and I are talking all the time about the opportunities of moving as much product as we can for our customers. And not only just the product that we currently have with our current customers, but the growth side of things and what else can we move out there. So to Jim's point, our hiring classes of over, I would say, probably the past two months have been extremely successful. We are putting 150-plus T&E, well new conductors, I guess, through our training center in Atlanta and we continue every single week to hold a new class. And I'm proud to say that all the hard work our HR team has done through Diana Sorfleet is paying off. And honestly, when we start looking at where we're going to be in three or four months from now, we're going to be a different look in railroad and these opportunities that Kevin is talking about is going to be opportunities that we're going after. Tom Wadewitz : So are you optimistic about a quick improvement related to Omicron or really just focus on second quarter for that improvement in capacity? James Foote : Yes, Tom, it's Jim. We're thinking about maybe getting an epidemiologist on staff. So if you're ready to step up and tell us, this is it, this is going to be over in two months, and we're not going to see another one, come on, you can start tomorrow. Tom Wadewitz : Sounds like second quarter. Thank you, Jim. James Foote : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Christian Wetherbee : Yes, hey thanks, good afternoon guys. Maybe I wanted to ask a question on pricing. So Kevin, maybe when you think about renewals for 2022, maybe how -- what the opportunity set is there and maybe how those are progressing as we've gotten through the month of January here? And then on the coal side, any help you can give us with how to think about yields and maybe just the first half of the year or over the course of 2022? I know the thermal exports are probably a full year renewal, so maybe you have some uplift there, but I think some of the next stuff is a little bit more closer to market. So if you could just help us with those points, that would be great. Kevin Boone : Yes. So let me cover the pricing side first, and obviously, we're going to get this question. The market is -- clearly, there's tight from the supply chain from the transportation side. You've seen our primary competition, truck rates are up significantly, and we're having to react to that, obviously, in what we're doing, but also working with customers on opportunities for them to convert more freight over to rail. In this high inflation market, they're looking for ways that they can save on their transportation costs and rail is almost every time the most economical solution for them. And so those discussions, I'm happy to say are really accelerating now and talking to Jamie every day on what we can do. So that's a really real positive for us. So I would say, certainly, the market is better than it was last year. We're working with customers. They understand the cost pressures that are out there across the world, they're seeing it. They're asking their customers for the same. So we're seeing some positive momentum on that side. In terms of coal, I mentioned it in my opening remarks, export coal prices benchmarks are at highs. What we\u2019ve assumed and your guess is probably as good as mine is that will moderate through the year. But what I can tell you is, if the economy reaccelerates post Omicron and China demand continues to be strong, then who knows it could last much longer. But what our assumption is going forward is that likely those prices will come down, so that will impact the yields somewhat into the back half of the year. But offsetting that somewhat we would expect maybe some volume progress as the producers ramp up some of their production as one of the new coal mines that I mentioned comes online as perhaps one of the coal mines that we serve resolve their strike and there's another major mine that we have right now that's shut down completely. So hopefully, some of those things come back online and help us on the volume side. Christian Wetherbee : That's great. And just quickly, merchandise and intermodal, how much of the contracts come up for renewal at the beginning of the year? Kevin Boone : Yes, we see about 50% to 60% renewed annually and about, call it, 75% of those in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Christian Wetherbee : Great. Thank you very much. Kevin Boone : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good afternoon. Jim, Union Pacific this morning talked about growing faster than industrial production or about 4.8% for their level of carloads. You picked GDP in your outlook. I just want to understand kind of trying to parse your growth target, which includes services on GDP. So can you kind of talk about that overall target or maybe that's a Sean question. And then you're now more than half a year in with Quality, are you seeing any of the contributions that you expected at this point from the acquisition? Thanks. James Foote : Yes, I'll talk about, Ken good to talk to you. Yes, I think we're comfortable with the Quality so far. I mean, it's playing out as we had expected. The customer enthusiasm about this product that we have in the marketplace now is very good. A lot of conversations are ongoing about converting to a transload type of operation versus truck direct. So -- and we haven't even got the equipment yet here from -- to utilize some of the ISO containers, which will help this conversion even more. So all in, yes, I mean, they're a great team, really smart people, extremely enthusiastic and excited about this opportunity so far. I think Sean is probably better to mediate between Lance's [ph] view of growth in mind. Sean Pelkey : I don't know about that, but I can just kind of give you a little bit of color, which I think Kevin really sort of already went through in terms of each of the markets and the puts and takes there. But I think the first half of the year or first quarter, at least on the auto side, we're going to continue to remain challenged. So and you can see it in our weekly numbers in terms of how that's trending. So the hope is that as we get into the second half of the year, that's part of kind of what drives the above GDP growth. Kevin also talked about some of the growth initiatives and the three he mentioned aren't the only three. Obviously, there's a lot going on within the sales and marketing team in terms of attracting new business to the railroad. And then fundamentally, our ability to capture the demand picture that's out there, assuming that the recent momentum we've had on the hiring front continues, and the tools that we're using in terms of retaining the employees we have continue to be successful, we grow the active T&E count, we're going to be able to move more volume. Ken Hoexter : Okay, thanks Jim. Thanks, Sean. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore. Your line is now open. Jonathan Chappell : Thanks Emma. Good afternoon everybody. Jamie, we've spent a lot of time on labor for obvious reasons, not just impacting you, it's impacting your customers as well. But if we could go all the way back to a few quarters ago before it really kind of rears had and the supply chain got into a real bad congestion issue, I know you were out in the field kind of looking for other type of improvements you can make within the network. So as we think about right-sizing the organization, getting through some of the supply chain congestion into normalized \u201cfluidity\u201d you guys seemed to have a head start here. So are there other opportunities for you within the network, whether it's just on trip plan performance or some of the cost levers in the back half of the year into 2023 that you think being a front runner here, you have a real opportunity on a relative basis? Jamie Boychuk : Jon, we are always analyzing the railroad. So I'm going out there again next week to spend some time on the railroad, and we'll be analyzing again what we're doing with our plan out there. So of course, as market conditions change, and other factors that go on out there, we analyze what we do. Yes, we just finished finding different opportunities to service our customers better, particularly in the Carolinas. We spent a lot of time out there just over this past quarter. But as I mentioned, we've put some assets out there in order to ensure that we can provide the service that our customers require right now. So there are some expenses that go along with that. And we see a quarter or two from now as our hiring catches up to where we need it to be, we'll be able to pull those assets back and/or use those assets for continued growth as we move forward. So there is -- there absolutely is always an opportunity on our railroad. The job of the folks out there, who are working really hard on the ground, their job is to execute. The network centers job is to analyze. And I work between those folks to make sure we're making the right decisions, and we'll continue to do that. So yes, there's always opportunities, but I can tell you right now, our focus is on growth. Our focus is on service and our focus is to make sure we continue to balance those expenses along the way. So that's going to be where we continue to push in towards 2022. Jonathan Chappell : Great. Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Hi everyone. I just had a couple of quick hit questions and then one kind of maybe a broad one for Jim. But for Sean, I wasn't sure about this when you answered it earlier. Are the margins of the business going to improve on a year-over-year basis against the 58.1 OR that you did in 2021 and I'm obviously excluding Virginia, I understand the timing of the Quality Carriers acquisition and all that, but ex-Virginia, are the margins going to improve year-over-year relative to the 58.1? And related to that, could you just talk about maybe what the expectations are on SS oil revenues year-over-year? Because I think that will probably be a little bit of a headwind in 2022. And then sorry, Jim, one out of the box question a little bit. You've had great success leading CSX and the whole team over the last many years under very difficult circumstances for sure. What is the thought process around succession planning? Do you plan or are you willing to lead CSX for many, many more years to come or do you think there is some scope for change internal or external? Can you just talk about that? Because it's a question that I get and we get a lot and I thought it would be interesting to get your thoughts on it as well. Thank you. Sean Pelkey : Amit, this is Sean. I'll take the first two to begin with. So on your operating ratio question, you've got the 58.1 full year impact of Quality. So what I was saying is that kind of takes you to a 59. So I think your question is, can we do better than that in 2022? And we're not going to give OR guidance today. And -- but that being said, I think we've kind of walked through all the factors that are going to drive growth, both in terms of our volumes, our revenues as well as operating income and what that means for OR. We go into the year with a little bit of an elevated cost profile. Probably in Q1, you're going to see costs that are largely similar to Q4, given that things have not gotten better from a supply chain and labor availability perspective. As we go through the year, we think that does improve. And if it does, then we also see volumes come along with it. And we think that sets us up very, very well. There are other uncertainties. What happens in the coal market with export coal pricing and other factors like Kevin talked about. And then the other piece of it that you hit on was the other revenue, I think largely other revenue is going to trend with the broader supply chain because the issues that we're facing that are causing containers to dwell on the intermodal side are the same factors that we're facing more broadly in the economy between driver availability, chassis availability and so on. And so it's likely other revenue is going to remain elevated here in the first quarter. And then I would say our baseline expectation is that it begins to normalize starting next quarter and then hopefully sort of back to normal by the second half of the year, which means we're probably moving more volumes, so those are the factors. James Foote : On the question of succession, clearly, it's been a topic since I got here starting in the beginning of 2018. You may recall, there's been quite a significant change in the management makeup here over that four-year period. And it has always been my goal and has always been the goal of the Board to make sure that we had in place a rock-solid diligent succession planning process and the procedure to follow for all of the executive management jobs. And I think when you talk on the call today and you heard these great new voices that are, so doing such an exceptional job, that's because of the diligence that went into making sure that we always have an available pipeline of qualified talent. And I could tell you from working with the Board, that's no different from my job. Our job and the Board's job is to make sure when Jim decides to go whenever that might be. Hopefully, it's when I decide not when they decide. But whenever we're going to fill that job that we have qualified people, both internally and externally that can step right in and being a significant shareholder, I hope you can do a better job than I think I have done. Maybe other people disagree, but it's been an interesting ride. Amit Mehrotra : Yes, well I appreciate you entertaining my question. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Your line is now open. Benjamin Nolan : Yes, I have two probably quick ones, if I can squeeze them in. The first is just when we're looking at the $2 billion of CapEx, curious if you might be able to parse that out between -- or what portion of that might actually be growth related? And the other one is, you talked a little bit about coal outages and I know there was an issue it occurs, how should we think about coal in the first quarter specifically? Sean Pelkey : Hi Ben, this is Sean. I'll take your first question around the CapEx and I would say CapEx is up about $200 million versus 2021. About half of that is related to growth investments. So Jamie talked a little bit about the sidings already, which set us up very well for the long-term to grow into the capacity that he'll be creating. We're making some incremental investments on the technology side. Some of the Quality investments in the ISO tanks fall into that category and then some commercial facilities. So lots of good high-return growth-oriented investments. The balance of the increase in capital is really driven by sort of inflation in the core infrastructure spend as well as slight increase in hardening the core infrastructure for safety and reliability. Jamie Boychuk : I would just add on the CapEx side that the siding extensions we're looking at mostly on our L&M part of our property, which was down in the Southern, Southwestern part of the railroad where we had smaller sidings. It worked for us, but the growth coming out of some of that area through Alabama and other stuff that's going on, the need is there. So that's where the majority of this CapEx money is going to, and we're excited to get it out in that area to support that growth that Kevin and his group are bringing. With respect to Curtis Bay, yes, we were down for a couple of weeks, but we're back up doing direct dumping. We did redirect a few trains to a couple of different locations, but we are back in business. Benjamin Nolan : All right, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is now open. Justin Long : Thanks and good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk about the impact you expect from Quality in 2022 from both the revenue and operating expense perspective as we try to model that out? And then circling back to some of the labor commentary, can you help us think through what you're expecting for the sequential change in headcount as we progress through this year? Sean Pelkey : Yes, Justin, it's Sean. I can take both of those. So the Quality impact is pretty straightforward. What you saw in the second half of this year, both in terms of revenue and expense is probably a pretty good run rate going into the next year into 2022, will have kind of a happier impact in Q1 and Q2 and then as we get into the back half, it should be pretty similar. The things that are going to drive any difference would really have to do with driver availability. The demand is very strong on the Quality side, but that's how I would think about it. So, a little over $400 million of revenue in the second half of this year. That's probably a good run rate around $200 million a quarter. In terms of sequential labor headcount, so you saw an increase of 1% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. I think that's probably a pretty good estimate of what we might see over the next couple of quarters. The good news is, as Jamie talked about, the head count we report to you includes both T&E employees who are in training as well as those that are marked up in revenue service. The mix between those that are in training and in service will change a little bit over the course of the first half year, which is great news. But the headcount should go up very modestly on a sequential basis over the first couple of quarters here. Justin Long : Okay, helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. So Sean, we have some pretty big headwinds from comp per employee and purchase services in the quarter, I think, including some accelerated costs. How should we think about those two pieces this year? And then, Kevin, just circling back on coal for one second, was your point about the net prices at highs suggesting that there's another sequential uptick in coal RPU in 1Q? Sean Pelkey : Scott, so comp per employee, you're right, it was elevated here in the fourth quarter, and that was one of the big factors there obviously was the incentive comp piece. So that should normalize as we get into 2022. I think if you look at it, excluding that for the back half of this year, that's probably a good baseline to build off of. We're going to have some higher labor inflation, which includes health costs as well as payroll tax and railroad unemployment. That will be partially offset by the incentive comp and then there's some favorable mix from the Quality addition in the first half of the year. Hopefully, as we get later into the year and the network is cycling better, we also see a reduction in overtime and things like that. So they're probably as a result of inflation, there will be a modest increase versus the normalized comp per employee, but not significant. And then in terms of purchase services, that's a line that has a lot of different moving pieces. What I can tell you is that you're probably going to see something similar in the first quarter to what you saw in the fourth quarter. But a lot of the costs that we added recently have to do with offsite storage and intermodal facilities, supplemental labor, adding some locomotives things like that. And that ties directly to overall fluidity within not only our network but the broader supply chain. So as that gets better, the purchase services costs should come down commensurate with that. Kevin Boone : Yes. And then on the coal RPU, we would expect something probably flattish in first quarter versus fourth quarter. Mix always matters. I would say the mix in terms of our domestic coal side should we see some of the supply issues at the mine and prove could help some of that southern coal longer haul pull maybe later here in the quarter that could help, but largely flat is the way we see it today. Scott Group : Okay. Sean, if I can just clarify one thing. It sounds like the purchase services headwind is an offset to this assessorial stuff. So as the accessorial goes lower, the purchase services costs go lower too, so don't think about the accessorial as 100% margin. Is that clear? Sean Pelkey : Yes, that's correct. I think it's --- that's right. That's right. Now probably accessorial may come down a little bit faster than purchase services just as -- just from a timing perspective, but they will trend together. Scott Group : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Bascome Majors : Yes, thanks for taking my question. Jim, you talked a little bit about having a lot of new faces in management over the last few years since you've been in the company. Can you talk about potentially updating the investor community with an Investor Day, other type of in? I mean it's approaching for years, you've acquired some non-rail businesses, you've got new faces and we've been through the global pandemic. Just curious when you think it might be time to kind of share your vision of where you think and you take CSX kind of midterm and how we're going to get there? Thank you. James Foote : I think we had probably planned on doing another Investor Day, at least a year ago, if not longer. But I don't really -- I personally have not felt that it's really that useful via teams or via Zoom and have every time we've kind of talked about getting out to New York or doing something here or whatever it is, something else comes along and kind of puts the kibosh on our plans. So as soon as Tom Waterwood gets here and tells me when the pandemic is going to end, then we'll schedule it up and get out and talk to all of you. I'd love to show this team off, they're fantastic. Bascome Majors : Yes, thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Your line is now open. Jason Seidl : Hey, thank you, operator. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I wanted to talk a little bit about the performance in the quarter on the operational side. I think this was the first time your trip plan compliance for the carload division got above 70%. So I wanted to find out what was going on there? And what else needs to be done to sort of try to close that gap between carload and Intermodal? Jamie Boychuk : Thank you, Jason. I'd say, as you've followed probably quarter-to-quarter, it is a slow climb. We're working really hard on the service product. It really comes down to the availability of people. Our COVID numbers were down into October, November, where we had maybe 30 or 40, maybe up to 60 T&E employees and then towards the end of the year up to where we are today, well over 300 to 350 folks off. So for us to really get this service product where we're arriving on the hour, as we continue to commit to, it really comes down to people. And we've been saying this for probably over a year now as we've struggled to even get that pipeline going. Now we've got a great pipeline. We continue to fill those classrooms and the folks in Atlanta are doing an absolute amazing job under Jim Switzenberg [ph] and his team. It's all about producing conductors and as this quarter continues, we should see that number come up, but again I think Jim has mentioned couple of times, it all comes down to what happens in the world with respect to COVID or whatever the next pandemic or item might be that affects our crewing of our trains, so that for us is the dial that really turns us up and down when we think about our service product. Jason Seidl : So I guess we'll just wait for a while to confirm the end of both, but good job and the numbers and we\u2019ll look for more steady improvement as the year goes on. I appreciate the time. James Foote : Well, you'll see that number we publish; we publish our velocity as well every week. And that\u2019s a good proxy for understanding of how fluid the railroad network is, whether you\u2019re trying to look at it from a service standpoint, a customer perspective and where we in terms of trip plan compliance or how much extra cost we're having out there because we're running slow. In the region, we run slow. It is not that the locomotives moving at a lower rate of speed, it's sitting someplace because it gets to a terminal where it's supposed to be recruited and there is nobody; we don\u2019t have an employee to get on the train because he got sick. And so, as that velocity number increases, as that drone number goes down, the result is that our customer performance metrics or our trip plan compliance numbers will just improve over time. Jason Seidl : Well, I always appreciated the fact that you guys publish this, because trip plan compliance is what most shippers look at anyway, so I much appreciate on my end. Jason Seidl : Good, great. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Jordan Alliger : Yes. Hi good afternoon. Just some, one if I have some thoughts on round revenue per carload, sort of from the total company perspective, obviously coming off two strong quarters, we talked a little about the first quarter recall, but as you think about moving through the year, taking into account mix, how do you think about revenue per carload first half, second half of wherever you want to talk through it? Thanks. Kevin Boone : Hey, this is Kevin. I'll take this one. Clearly, yes, we had some strong performance. Some of that, obviously, was due to the impact of fuel surcharge. We see that probably being a favorable impact into the first quarter and probably less so as you move into the back half of the year and just face tougher comparisons there. There's a couple probably larger swing items we've talked about quite a bit already but the export coal side will be a large swing item into the second half of the year if prices and the benchmark prices remain. That will obviously be a good impact. We've talked about how we reprice 50% to 60% of our business every year, and so you'll start to see that impact start to flow through probably more heavily in the back half of the year. And then on, those are probably the major moving parts across the business and obviously mix always matters. If intermodal is outgrowing your merchandise side of your business, that's always a negative mix. So we would, we would expect merchandise to remain strong, but intermodal has proven over the last few years to be outgrowing merchandise, which is a good thing, but can have a negative impact on the overall RPU. Jordan Alliger : Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Walter Spracklin : Yes, thanks very much operator. Good morning or good afternoon everyone. Just a question here on the environment that we're in right now and how different it is and whether that creates opportunities for you to kind of re-envision some of the historical practices, you do, particularly around contracts with customers and contracts with employees. So given Jim, you mentioned you just can't get an Jamie as well, you can't get people, I\u2019m wondering if this sets the stage possibly for a bigger push on automation, perhaps it's a little easier to get automation through if the workforce is short people? And secondly, same thing on the customer base, if you've got a customer base if you got a -- high demand for transportation services, does it allow you to perhaps restructure aspects of the contract that you might not have been able to do in the past, open up that door whether it's on duration to your favor longer or shorter. I'm not sure which one you would prefer, but items like that on either of those two, I'd love to hear any color that you might have? James Foote : Well, on the customers, we have -- for good or bad, and yes, maybe this -- the last two years has caused us to rethink everything because things that we never thought were possible to happen, have happened. So we look at -- I think we look at the world differently. Our relationships with our customers is -- this is a big business. It's a big business. Our -- we have relatively long term, not as long as some contracts. But a couple of three-year duration with a customer who is making huge capital investments in these plants, in order to produce and has to have some level of longer-term reliability on what is transportation costs are going to be for them to be able to plan how to run its business. So trying to change that is difficult. I think every -- and again, our customers are reasonable people. So I think there's dialogues about what works there's always what works for both. It's a partnership arrangement in terms of how we help our customers be successful in these markets. In some circumstances, it may have accelerated our views to a certain degree in terms of -- there's been a modification. There's certainly been a change in the e-commerce arena about who buys themselves transportation in the marketplace. And so, we're dealing in certain circumstances more directly with the customers as it worked with third parties in -- that we did in the past and I think that's something that probably will evolve and continue to change. In terms of working with how we interact and how we contract with people that want to work for us, I think this is a big challenge and a huge opportunity for us to really upfront address what we think the worker who wants to work for the railroad is, what's the profile of that individual, not six months from now and not a year from now, but five years and 10 years from now. And how do we evolve for this industry in an extremely again, in most circumstances, how would you do this differently? How can you do this better? We can't put kiosks in place to do the work of a conductor or an engineer. But there's certainly technology out there that would allow us to do things more effectively, easier and probably with fewer employees. But we also work in an extremely heavily unionized environment that is also very heavily regulated with at times bent on telling us how we should do things. So we're always in the middle of going through the process and but yes, it's opened our eyes, and I think it's opened everybody's eyes in the transportation business about what we need to do to be more effective and handle these types of issues in the future. Walter Spracklin : Have you found that the automation question has been easier to enter into with unions in the current environment compared to previously? James Foote : No. Walter Spracklin : Okay, I appreciate the time, Jim. James Foote : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open. David Vernon : Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the time. Two from me, Jamie, could you talk a little bit about where you expect headcount to be as we exit sort of the 2022 time frame? And then, Jim, I'd love to get your perspective having had some time presumably to review Norfo Gas [ph] asset and the CPKC transaction. Kind of what do you think about that and what you think about the implications of that, what you think the implications of that ask would be for CSX in the long run? Jamie Boychuk : Just touching, I think Sean talk a little bit about it. But look, we have 6% to 8% attrition per year. We have to remember that. So not only do we have to hire to cover attrition, we've got to hire to get that number where we need to be in our minds to be able to provide the service that's required and the growth that Ken and his group are going after. So I'll leave it -- I'll kind of leave it at this. We are actively hiring. We have over 500 conductor trainees right now between Atlanta and what's out in the field and we're not stopping. We're going to continue to get folks out there qualified as conductors. And we've got a round of qualifying for locomotive engineers here at some point within the next year or two. So -- but we want to make sure that we can provide that service and grow this company. James Foote : As it relates to the other railroads' filings in the CP and KCS deal, I'm not surprised at all, but the other railroads, some of the other railroads have weighed in with the requests to make sure that their franchises and their customers primarily are protected. And each railroad has its own unique requests and that process is just starting. We're just -- we didn\u2019t get involved in the substantive conversation around what the impacts are of that transaction. You may have seen that we took the position with the FTB that we didn't have enough information basically yet to formulate an opinion. So until we have gone on the record, so to speak, with what it is, what it is that we're going to ask for and we're still kind of looking at what it is we're going to ask for and what do other people ask for and what does that mean that sort of thing? It's really -- I'm not going to comment on any specific filing that any other railroad that made yet. David Vernon : That's fair. But I guess, if I could just press a little bit. Is the scope of that Norfo Gas surprising to you or are you -- was that kind of as expected? James Foote : Again, I'm not going to characterize anything. Jamie Boychuk : No, no comments at this point. James Foote : No. Like I said, it's not probably would be a comment really one way or the other where I thought it was aggressive or not aggressive or it's -- we're trying to figure out what everybody is doing and that takes time. It's a long, long, long process here for us to gather information, for us to look at everything, and then we'll formulate what we think is the right thing for CSX to do. And then at that point in time, we'll be in a better position to comment on what I think about whatever everybody else asked for. David Vernon : That\u2019s fair. Thanks a lot for the time guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Your line is now open. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much. Good afternoon We're starting to run a little long, so I'll just ask a quick one here in terms of coal and the producer outages that you experienced during the quarter and the new mine you have coming online, just wondering if you can help us frame that a little better in terms of the tonnage impact and the timing of when it could come back or come online initially in case of the new mine? Kevin Boone : Yes. I wish I had a crystal ball. There's one particular mine that keeps on telling us that they're going to come back online, and it seems to get pushed out every week. And so, no I don't have a lot of visibility, I have probably more confidence that as we get into the second, third, fourth quarter that we\u2019ll see some pickup there. The good news is they have a lot more cash to reinvest in their business, whether it's equipment and other things. So I would think we'll see some benefits of that as well. I mentioned one particular customer dealing with the strike. Those things have continued for quite a while, but eventually those things get resolved as well. The other one, the mine that I mentioned that's coming online, it will be a slow ramp-up, and we would expect more volumes in the second half and that's mainly into the export market. So we're positive there. We're -- it's a supportive market obviously, and we're going to look for opportunities to move more coal as we get more crude availability into the second half. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thank you for the time. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ravi Shanker : Thank you everyone. One big picture question and one follow-up. The big -- bigger question is on domestic intermodal. Just based on your conversations with your customers, kind of do you have a sense of what it's going to take for shippers to move significant amount of volumes off truck and third on the rail. Is it as simple as just clearing the congestion or are there more complex issues with speed and service and flexibility that kind of take longer to resolve? And just a followup, Kevin, you kind of mentioned the cadence of your contract renewals, we are seeing on the truck side that customers are trying to push for shorter contracts or more frequent price resets on the contract side are you seeing anything similar? Thank you. Kevin Boone : On the contract side, nothing has really changed. We're obviously working with customers to create more even cadence through the rail network and I work with Jamie all the time, and we go out to customers and explain the challenges that they create and they can create more ratability of their volumes through our system. That's extremely helpful. And so working with them a lot on that side, so that's a big opportunity there. And then what was the first part of the question? Ravi Shanker : Just intermodal and kind of what it takes to get\u2026? Kevin Boone : Okay, yes. On the intermodal side, I think having spoken to you recently just one of our many customers; I think consumer behavior is actually going the other way. The expectation is not that they necessarily need something next day. So I would say, the emphasis on speed is actually going the other way to some degree, and we're seeing conversations around maybe I don't need to move it over a truck and get it there in 24 hours, that 48, 72-hour option is valuable. It's obviously cost effective, where a lot of our customers are looking to offset very, very high prices. I would say, on the domestic side, really the challenge has been equipment. It's not a lack of demand. We get calls every day. They want to put more volume on us. But if they can't get the volume out of the terminal, that's a problem. And that's what we've been dealing with. But we think that will resolve itself. It's obviously going to be easier to get truck drivers that you can get home at night that are doing the short haul, and that really plays into our sweet spot. The long-haul truckers aren't there. And I don't think that the drivers are going to come back to that market, but we do think the shorter haul drivers are going to become more and more available. But it's not just the drivers, it's the chassis, and we know there's a lot of orders out there, and so that will resolve itself. And then the container side, a lot of containers being ordered right now. So we do think as we get into the second half, we'll have a lot of tailwinds that will help us really accelerate growth. Ravi Shanker : Great, thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for attending. You may disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2022 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Matthew Korn, CSX Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Matthew Korn : Thank you, Emma. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In our presentation, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on slide two, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on slide three. And with that, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim? Jim Foote : Great. Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for again joining us on our call today. I will begin by expressing my thanks to all of CSX employees, who continue to put in tremendous efforts to serve our customers effectively and above all safely. I\u2019d also like to welcome today, Steve Fortune, who\u2019s with us in the room here today in Jacksonville. Steve serves in a newly created role of Executive Vice President and Chief Digital and Technology Officer, and will focus on harnessing transformative technologies to further growth and enable continued efficiency across the business. His experience leading technology organizations at a global industrial company will be very helpful as we continue to transform CSX. Now moving to the quarter, we are pleased with our results this quarter, though we are not yet satisfied with our service performance. The effects of COVID and severe weather across much of our network clearly led to a tough start to the year. But as we moved into March, operating conditions began to gradually improve and we do see indications that this momentum is continuing. For over a year, we have communicated to you that the key to rebuilding our service to pre-pandemic levels is to hire more trained and engine service employees. I am pleased to say that our efforts there are progressing well and our active T&E count has moved steadily higher this year. The people and resources that we are putting in place today will allow us to provide reliable, efficient service to an expanding number of customers. The business environment remains very favorable for CSX, despite new uncertainties across global supply chains. We are dedicated to do our part to help our customers here in North America meet increasing demand, as business and consumers around the world look for reliable sources of the products that we transport. Meanwhile, domestic activity remains robust, and our business development and marketing groups are working hard to convert new opportunities. And as higher energy prices and increasing scrutiny on greenhouse gas emissions, highlight rails efficiency advantages over trucks, we are in a great position. If we all do our jobs, hold to our principles and deliver the service levels that we know we can achieve, this company has great potential for many years ahead. Lastly, I\u2019d like to note that we are pleased with the Surface Transportation Board approved our acquisition of Pan Am Railways, which clears the way for the transaction to close this June. All of us are excited about the opportunities that will come as we design new service solutions for shippers and receivers in New England. Now let\u2019s turn to slide four. Turning to the presentation, which highlights our key financial results, we moved nearly 1.5 million carloads in the first quarter and generated over $3.4 billion in revenue. Operating income increased by 16% to $1.28 billion. The operating ratio increased by 150 basis points to 62.4%. But remember, this range includes approximately 250 basis points of impact from quality carriers and the impact of higher fuel prices. And earnings per share increased 26% to $0.39 a share. I will now turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for details. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Jim. Turning to slide five. First quarter revenue increased 21% year-over-year, with growth across all major lines of business. Merchandise revenue increased 6% on 2% lower volume as strong pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue more than offset the volume decline. Current demand remains strong across most merchandise markets, with shippers prioritizing environmental benefits of rail and pursuing lower cost options to offset inflation. The ongoing semiconductor shortage impacted automotive volumes through the quarter. However, we did see sequential improvement as consumer demand remains strong with dealer inventory levels low. Our core chemical franchise saw strong demand that more than offset continued challenges in energy-related chemical markets. As we continue to add resources across the network, we expect to capture additional opportunities. Intermodal revenue increased 13% on 1% lower volumes, as truck conversions drove domestic growth. Offsetting declines in the international market that continues to be impacted by supply side constraints. Intermodal demand remains strong, but continues to be challenged by takeaway capacity and equipment shortages including chassis. Coal revenue increased 39% on 10% lower volume. Export coals revenue increase was driven by higher benchmark prices, partially offset by lower domestic and international thermal coal shipments. First coal -- first quarter coal volumes were impacted by several factors, including mine disruptions in an outage at our Curtis Bay export facility. Demand across all of our coal markets remains strong and we expect volumes to improve in the second quarter, as some of these headwinds subside and additional network capacity is added. Other revenue increased primarily due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage, but was partially offset by lower payments from customers that did not meet volume commitments. As we exit the quarter, concerns around the Omicron variant have been replaced by broader global supply chain uncertainty in the wake of the crisis in Ukraine. As Jim mentioned, we are committed to helping our customers. In North America meet the increasing demand for their products from consumers around the world. We are working closely with our customers to understand the potential shifts in the global supply chain. And while it is early, we see opportunities that could benefit our network and the port\u2019s we serve. As we look across many of our markets, demand continues to outstrip supply. We expect this to improve as resources are added across the supply chain. Now turning to slide six. I\u2019d like to provide more detail on CSX\u2019s business development capabilities, which I briefly discussed last quarter. CSX has an experienced team of business development professionals to help existing and prospective customers identify, design and build facilities across the network. This team works closely with state and local economic developers to maximize investment incentives that will encourage more businesses to locate on CSX and our short line partners. These efforts continue to pay off. In 2021, over 90 new facilities and expansion projects were placed into service across our network, which represents over $3 billion of customer investment. Additionally, there are over 500 projects currently in an industrial pipeline. We are excited to work with these customers and provide them with efficient and reliable rail service that will enable them to grow their business for years, while creating significant long-term value for CSX shareholders. Most recently VinFast, the electric vehicle subsidiary of the large Asian conglomerate Vingroup announced that they will build a $4 billion electric vehicle assembly plant and battery manufacturing facility served exclusively by CSX. The team is proud to be part of North Carolina\u2019s first car plant in the largest economic development announcement in the state\u2019s history. This announcement is an excellent example of the kind of customer solutions that the team can deliver, as sales and marketing works closely with operators. The team is working diligently to direct even more customers to CSX by Select Site program. CSX Select Sites feature nearly 10,000 acres of premium certified rail serve sites to full scale industrial development and expansion. We are working to add even more sites to this program in 2022. I will now pass it on to Jamie to discuss our operations. Jamie Boychuk : Thanks, Kevin. The safety of our operations will always be our first priority. Our concern for all of our employees, customers and the communities in which we live and operate drives us to make sure that we maintain the demanding standards of our safety focused culture. The results that you see on slide seven show this clearly. Over the first quarter, we saw sequential and year-over-year improvements in the number of injuries and train accidents, which brought their frequency rates to a near record low levels for the first quarter. We are happy to see this improvement. We continue to push forward with the initiatives that we described to you last quarter, actively coaching, safety awareness among our employees, encouraging best practice sharing across teams and expanding our application of technology, and we put a very strong emphasis on our efforts with our new hires to ensure that they respect and demonstrate the principles that make CSX an industry safety leader. Moving on to slide eight. For the last several quarters, you have heard us discuss the efforts we are making to address our staffing levels. This is a critical point, because our networks, capacity and fluidity will improve when we have enough trained conductors and engineers. When we have these resources, it lifts our service performance in the near-term, while also ensuring that we are ready to meet the substantial demand growth we anticipate in the years ahead. This slide also shows several important positive train and engine employee trends that reflect the hard work done by our recruiting and training teams. We have made great progress here and importantly, we are set up to build on the momentum we have created. First, you can see a strong ramp up in the number of T&E employees we have in our training program. We averaged over 500 daily employees in training over the first quarter, which is over 5 times where we were a year ago. We expect to keep our training classes full to make sure that our pipeline remains healthy. Second, we have successfully increased our run rate of conductors who are completing their training and marking up into the active T&E population. We now have roughly 100 employees marking up each month who are ready to haul freight, generate revenue and we expect this pace to continue. In the last chart, you can see the payoff, return in the corner and we are now adding to our active T&E count month-over-month. We have said it again and again, our aim is to grow this railroad, so that we need to bring good people in, train them the right way and deliver on service. It takes time, but this is exactly what we are doing. Now let\u2019s turn to slide seven, which gives us a picture on where our operations stand today. This quarter started off with several key challenges. The Omicron wave was hitting our employees, where the incident at our Curtis Bay facility and the East Coast suffered under severe weather in early February. So for the full quarter, our key metrics of trip line compliance, terminal car dwell and velocity were generally flat to slightly worse on a sequential basis. That said, as Jim highlighted in his remarks, early into the second quarter, we are seeing encouraging signs that these metrics are starting to move in the right direction. It\u2019s clearly too quick to call the bottom with certainty, but with the success of our hiring initiatives, and a continued drive for discipline and consistency in the field, we see reasons to be optimistic. Consistent with the last quarter, we have made the tactical decision to keep additional locomotives active in the near-term to help with network balance, while we remain short of employees in certain regions. As we successfully promote our new conductors, we will be focused on improving our asset utilization and driving efficiency as the additional crew resources facilitate higher volumes and improve service and reliability. As always, the key will be strong execution and I am excited at the level of higher engagement and enthusiasm that our operating team is bringing to this challenge. I am looking forward to showing what we can do over this next quarter, the rest of the year and the years to come. I will now hand it over to Sean to review the financial results. Sean Pelkey : Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon. Our focus is on profitable growth and despite the challenges we faced in the quarter, we delivered $600 million of revenue gains, with operating income of 16%. Interest expense and other income were a combined $11 million favorable and the effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.9%. Earnings per share of $0.39 reflects growth in core earnings, as well as the impact of our ongoing share repurchase program. Turning to the next slide. Total costs increased $419 million or 24% in the quarter, but we are in line with our expectations outside of the spike in fuel price. The acquisition of Quality Carriers represented approximately $215 million of expense. Higher fuel prices were also a significant factor, up about $110 million versus last year. All other expenses increased approximately $95 million, driven by inflation, as well as ongoing costs related to supply chain congestion and network fluidity. Turning to the specific line items, labor and fringe expense increased $72 million or 12% in the quarter. We invested $10 million more to onboard new train and engine employees, and we expect similar training costs next quarter, as we continue to convert our strong new hire pipeline. Quality Carriers drove about $35 million in additional labor expense. Incentive compensation increased $6 million, while inflation and other impacts drove just over $20 million of higher costs. Purchased services and other expense increased $203 million or 43% in the quarter. Quality Carriers represented approximately $140 million of PS and other expense. Costs incurred to maintain terminal and network fluidity added roughly $45 million of expense in the quarter similar to last quarter\u2019s impact. These costs are likely to persist into the second quarter and we expect to see improvement in the back half of the year, corresponding to labor and supply chain normalization. Additionally, a legacy environmental reserve adjustment drove $17 million of higher expense in the quarter. Depreciation and amortization was up $15 million or 4% higher asset base that also includes the quality impact. Finally, fuel expense increased to $141 million or 74%, reflecting a steep increase in highway diesel fuel prices, as well as the addition of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking. The rapid rise in fuel prices created approximately $45 million of fuel lag in the quarter. And lastly, the company recognized $27 million of real estate gains in the quarter, including $20 million related to the Virginia transaction. As a reminder, we expect to recognize the $120 million Virginia gain in the second quarter and receive the final $125 million cash payment in the fourth quarter. Now turning to cash flow on slide 12. Free cash flow before dividends increased on higher earnings to $976 million. Our highest priority use of cash is investing for the long-term reliability and growth of our railroad. After fully funding these capital projects, first quarter shareholder returns exceeded $1.2 billion, including approximately a $1 billion in buybacks and over $200 million in dividends. Looking forward, we will remain balanced and opportunistic in our buyback approach as we continue to return excess cash to our shareholders. Finally, we are excited to close the Pan Am deal on June 1st. Pan Am will contribute about 1 point of annualized revenue, primarily within merchandise. Due to transaction and integration costs, Pan Am will have a negligible impact on earnings this year and the capital we expect to invest to upgrade to Pan Am network is already contemplated in our guidance. We look forward to working with Pan Am and its customers to drive continued growth through our integrated rail network. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Foote : Okay. So let\u2019s conclude with our outlook for the year as shown on slide 13. We continue to benefit from strong markets and ample customer demand, and we are adding employs the needs that our network can capture more of the business opportunities that are right in front of us. At the same time, we are of course keeping a close eye on inflation, interest rates and the fed. With support from higher coal prices and a supportive market environment, we feel comfortable projecting double-digit growth for both revenue and operating income for the full year. In the near-term, we expect to continue to benefit from elevated export coal prices and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Full year CapEx is planned at approximately $2 billion, which is also unchanged. We have made progress since the beginning of the year and we still have a lot of work to do, but we are committed to supporting our customers by providing them with reliable, efficient, cost effective rail solutions for their changing transportation needs. By adding the necessary resources and lifting our service levels, we will be well-positioned for years of profitable growth. Thanks and I will turn it back to Matthew. Matthew Korn : Thank you, Jim. Now in the interest of time, I\u2019d ask that everyone please limit yourself to just one question. And with that, Emma, we will now be happy to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore. Your line is now open. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Jamie, you spent a fair amount of time talking about the important labor aspects and what -- and your optimism about what that will mean for service? Is it just a function of getting the people trained in the right spots or are there any other challenges that you are seeing, it\u2019s related to service reliability? These are things that you can control yourself, are things outside of your control, like customers turning over equipment more quickly and how do you think that all of that translates into the important service metrics like velocity dwell and cars online in the next couple of quarters? Jamie Boychuk : Well, good evening or good afternoon, Jon. For us, it\u2019s purely comes down to hiring numbers and getting more T&E folks where we need them. Kevin and I have been worked really closely with our customers to do everything we can to support those needs of our customers. And our customers are working with us in different areas with different solutions as we look at how we can turn cars quicker, whether it comes down to block loading by destination and other items that we have been working on for years and continuing to work with our customers that way, so we don\u2019t have to handle cars as much. But definitely, when we are looking at that pure number with respect to our trainees out there, we talked about having 500 or 500 trainings out there right now. We have qualified up to 400 already this year since the start of the year. So we have come a long way in that area and we continue to pull whatever levers we can with respect to the design, if there\u2019s cars we can move in different corridors that make more sense where our crew base has gotten healthier, we are doing that. But really as we continue to push forward here, the common theme that we know we will get our railroad back to where we need to is just continuing to train conductors. Jon Chappell : Got it. Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is now open. Brandon Oglenski : Hey. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I guess, if we go back to last quarter, you guys were, I think, the only guides you provide those like volume above GDP. But now it seems you have some confidence to guide to double-digit op income and revenue growth. Can you just talk to maybe the increased confidence as you have gone through the year here and what\u2019s driving that guidance now? Jim Foote : Yeah. Brandon, look, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. Obviously, one, they get confidence and the hiring trajectory, and Jamie spoke to that, we are seeing good momentum as we get into April and we will move through the rest of the quarter. Obviously, some other factors have occurred. You have seen the export coal market remain really, really strong here and supportive, and we had assumed probably that market would tail off a little bit sooner than what is expected now. Also fuel surcharge has been a bigger factor going forward as well as oil prices have obviously moved up dramatically here with the Ukraine crisis going on. But the number of factors going, we still see the strong demand from all of our markets and we have competence that we are going to begin to capture more and more of that as we -- as fluidity picks up through the network. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is now open. Justin Long : Thanks. And I guess to start with the follow up on that last question. Does the guidance still assume that volumes outpace GDP this year? And then, is there any color you can give on the OR excluding the Virginia real estate sale that\u2019s embedded in that assumption for double-digit operating income growth? Jim Foote : Yeah. I will cover the first one. Look, that\u2019s been our target. We want to outgrow the economy. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts, as you know, the auto business -- automotive business is going to be a big factor as we get in the second half and that business on production needs to recover there to really hit those GDP plus targets. So that\u2019s one market to look at. Coal, as well, we see strong demand there, but we will be watching that going forward. And then the intermodal market, particularly on the domestic side, we are assuming chassis and other drayage capacity comes back into the market and that will drive some incremental growth for us as well. So there\u2019s a few moving parts, but that\u2019s always our target and that\u2019s why we came out at the beginning of the year as we expect to exceed GDP volume growth, but realizing that there\u2019s a number of new moving parts going on right now. Sean Pelkey : And Justin, this is Sean. Just to add on with the OR question, I think it\u2019s -- as we have always said, the -- we expect the incremental margins on the growth to be very strong and very healthy, and that will be supportive in terms of the OR for the year. But there are some things to keep in mind that will be offsets, obviously, the quality impact, which will have the full impact of it in the first half of the year, given that the acquisition occurred in Q3 of last year. Higher fuel prices are essentially neutral to op income, but they do have a negative impact on the operating ratio as well. And then, obviously intermodal storage as things normalize, that will have an impact on the OR, particularly in the second half of the year, given that the storage revenues were quite elevated in the second half of last year. Justin Long : Okay. I will leave it there. I appreciate the time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Your line is now open Chris Wetherbee : Hey. Great. Thanks and good afternoon. I guess I wanted to come back a little bit to the sort of bigger picture, freight demand comment that you made earlier in the call, Jim, I just maybe if you could talk a little bit about what you are seeing either on the consumer or the industrial side, we can kind of see what\u2019s happening on the commodity side, but maybe those two end markets? And then maybe just sort of weave that into the market share potential opportunity? Congestion has probably kept some business off the rail and on other modes of transportation. How does that factor in? So, I guess, generally speaking, you see a slowdown in consumer driven freight and is there enough upside potential in industrial commodity to offset that? Jim Foote : Well, I think, we have been going through since really the middle of 2018 divergence between the consumer economy and the industrial economy, whether it was driven by going back to the tariff issues that began to create concern amongst the industrial producers, and at the same time, you had a consumer economy that was going gangbusters. And that kind of carried forward into the pandemic years, let\u2019s call it, the plague years of 2020 and 2021 and industrial really got hammered, especially in still -- there\u2019s still lingering effects from that and it\u2019s a -- look at the automotive sector and the consumer economy went nuts. So, now, I think, you are starting to see those two divergent economies come back more in line and industrial demand is very good. Is it -- I think it\u2019s clear in our comments. We have not met the demand and as the railroad on the industrial side and the bulk side of the business, we have done a very -- I think we have done an amazing job in handling the consumer side of the business in the intermodal sector throughout the last couple of years. So the demand is there, as the railroad begins to continue to improve as we go forward, we see a lot of opportunity and there could be changes, while there are obviously -- obviously, there are going to be changes in various supply chains, whether it\u2019s import/export grain, whether it\u2019s continued demand for U.S. coal, steel, plastics, chemicals, you name it, everything is going to be moving around a little bit. But we see all of these sectors being assuming that everything in the world stays relatively sane, where we are today, if you don\u2019t want to call the sanity, a great environment for us to excel and the only reason we haven\u2019t achieved it in the last, nine months ago, I said that the numbers that we are talking about today, in terms of where we would be with hiring, that\u2019s where we thought we would be nine months ago. The extremely tight labor market and the higher -- somewhat higher attrition rates that we went through have held us back and so we have figured it out. We have done everything we could possibly do to take advantage of the situation. And I think the economy on both, especially so on the industrial side of the economy, where traditionally railroads have excelled looks favorable as we look forward. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Thanks. This is Mike Toran [ph] on for Tom. You have made really good progress on adding the T&E employees. Is there -- do you have an idea of or which point this year you think you are going to be all kind of trued up from a T&E crew perspective? And also, is there a way to quantify how much volume you have left on the table because of the crew constraints that you will be able to capture once you are kind of fully trued up on cruise? Jim Foote : Well, in terms of what we left behind, I will use a term that Tom uses quite often lots and I will leave it at that. In terms of where we are going to be, from a timing standpoint, where we will get, but I will say, what Jamie mentioned earlier, we are going to continue to hire. We are going to manage this employee pipeline differently than we have in the past. We are going to make sure that lessons learned here that we are going to make sure that this doesn\u2019t happen to us again. And so that\u2019s why we are doing everything we can from an employee relations standpoint to work closer with our employees, because they are critical and key to what we want to do here and that is provide a reliable truck like product across all of our, well, truck likes reliability to all of our customers, because that\u2019s the key to the future for the company\u2019s growth. Jamie, do you want any color about timing. Jamie Boychuk : Our timing is, we are really shooting in towards the third quarter. As we push the number of employees, we have training right now, if those qualified and we continue to do our hiring of 30 to 40 every single week, puts us in a good position at some point in the third quarter, it might be towards the tail end of the third quarter. And then -- and to Jim\u2019s point, we are continuing to hire for attrition as attrition moves forward. We have seen attrition climb up and we got to make sure that we stay ahead of that throughout this year and then into next year and we have got many different programs that we want to continue to train locomotive engineers and other pieces. So we are not going to be stopping at any point in time here soon. But we feel pretty confident as long as the world doesn\u2019t throw us some type of a curveball again. Q3 is going to be a much better quarter for us. Jim Foote : Just yeah and a little more color on that. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah. Jim Foote : It is easy for us to manage now. We have an attrition rate of around 7%. So we are not concerned with getting fat, because we can always manage down. What we have learned over the last year, year and a half is, it is extremely difficult. It is a completely different environment to try and add to the workforce. So we just have to look at it a little differently. That doesn\u2019t mean we are going to get fat and happy and have a bunch of employees that we don\u2019t need. That means that we are going to manage the workforce differently to make sure with the ebbs and flows of this business, which is always the case that we do it in a more -- in a different manner. So we don\u2019t get caught short like we just did. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Jamie. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Scott Group : Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. So I want to maybe think about the back half of the years, sounds like that\u2019s when you think you will have the headcount where you want it to be in the network where you want it to be? Do you still think that you will have volume growth in excess of headcount in the back half of the year? And then maybe, Sean, how much is the -- how much are you spending in 1Q and 2Q on hiring and network and efficiencies that may be potentially starts to go away in the back half of the year? Sean Pelkey : Yeah. Scott, to your -- first part of your question, I mean, remember, we are -- with all we are doing in hiring, we are netting up roughly 1% a quarter on a sequential basis. So that that -- the cumulative impact of that is a couple of percent year-over-year in headcount by the time we get to the second half of the year, and yeah, I think we ought to be able to grow in excess of that. We have got capacity on trains and in the network. We have got locomotives to move the freight. So we should be able to outpace it in terms of growth. And then in terms of your question on the cost side, those training costs are -- it\u2019s up $10 million versus last year, so call it, roughly $15 million a quarter that we are spending on training right now. I don\u2019t see that going away. Like, Jim just said, we are going to continue to hire. So that\u2019s probably pretty reasonable across the balance of the year. The piece that is probably more variable is the $45 million or so that we mentioned in purchase services and others. Most of which is really related to supply chain congestion, whether it be costs related to intermodal container yards and terminal labor, outsource labor or whether it be related to having more locomotives than we would otherwise need if the network were running faster, there\u2019s also an impact to rent. So think about it in terms of that roughly $45 million is the opportunity to kind of get back to where we were once we get this thing spinning. Scott Group : Okay. And if I can just sneak in one more quickly for Kevin. The coal RPU, is this -- are we seeing the full benefit at this point of the net prices and everything or is there one more potential leg up here? Kevin Boone : No. I think this is largely -- some of our -- on the met side, some of the contracts are capped. So they don\u2019t fully to participate in these extreme prices. So this is probably a good run rate, assuming that core prices stay at those current levels they are today. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you, guys. Appreciate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open. Brian Ossenbeck : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just coming back to labor, and Jim, maybe if you can elaborate on how you expect to manage the workforce a bit differently. I know it\u2019s challenging especially right now to manage everything, all the different moving parts. But is this more technology, are these different types of rules that you expect to put into place? And on that line if you got the $600 incentive -- up to $600 incentives that you announced yesterday, do you feel like you have done everything you can at this point to really get the people where you need and the amount you need them in place? Jim Foote : Well, I think, anybody that\u2019s followed the railroad business for a long time, like you have and everybody else on the call knows that the relationships between the railroads and the union workforce is not necessarily been one of mutual admiration and we need to fix that and we are working extremely hard. And throughout this process, we have, I mean, these guys were out there for two years in the middle of a pandemic working every single day and night in a chaotic operating environment caused by surges in traffic and you name it. And at the same time didn\u2019t get a raise. That\u2019s wrong in my opinion. And that\u2019s why we decided to do something about it unilaterally without asking for some kind of get back in the labor agreement. We just thought it was the right thing to do and so we made the offer and that\u2019s a change. It\u2019s not technology. It\u2019s relationship building with your unionized workforce and we need to change that and we are going to -- we are dedicated to changing that. And it is an ongoing long-term process, but CSX is committed to trying to do everything we can possibly do to change decades if not centuries of the somewhat dysfunctional relationship with our human workforce, that\u2019s the key and that\u2019s what this is all about. Brian Ossenbeck : All right. Thank you, Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Ken Hoexter : Hey. Great. Good afternoon. So you gave the double-digit operating income targets and the cost. I just want understand what\u2019s built in for the timing of the fluidity, is that just simply the second half? And in the past we have seen, I guess, rails throw a lot of assets to get the fluidity moving, is that something you -- we need to do to get things moving aside from the employees? And then, I guess to follow that, Jim, into next week hearing as to what you are doing to fix the service, is just the focus here, the key on employees or again is there equipment need or anything to kind of throw at these backlogs to get the fluidity moving up the rail network? Thanks. Jim Foote : So we are not short of locomotives. We are not short of any physical infrastructure in order to be able to perform and that we continue to still have excess capacity across the railroad. There is one thing and one thing only that we are short of that is hampering us from doing the job that we want to do and to get back to the service levels where we were in 2019 and to get even better from that point on is we need more people in the engineer and conductor ranks. That\u2019s it. We don\u2019t need them anywhere else in the organization. We don\u2019t need more management people. We don\u2019t need a lot -- we don\u2019t need more people fixing the track and laying rail. They are doing a great job out there. We need more engineers and conductors, and that\u2019s it and that\u2019s what we are dedicated to do and that is why we will continue to focus on these numbers. And it is a lengthy process from the time we finally get someone, it is an extremely lengthy process from the time we start looking for somebody that in this day and age might want to be a railroad conductor until the time they have gone through the classroom. First of all, the pre-employment screening, then by the time they go through the month or more of classroom instruction and then six months on the job training and then we have to make sure at that point in time, they are equipped and ready to go out and work in a railroad operating environment and not get hurt and not hurt somebody else. It\u2019s a long, long process and that\u2019s why it has taken so long. As I said earlier, nine months longer, because of the front end of the process was not went away from us. The pipeline of normal candidate that might want to -- usually wanted to work in the railroad business, they don\u2019t want to go to work. They wanted to stay home. They wanted to do something else. And so we have had to revamp, work extremely hard and now we are beginning to realize the benefits of all that hard work and it\u2019s going to be month after month after month after month with these employees are then qualified, they actually go out and start performing work and as the year goes on, on a month-to-month-to-month basis, we will see continued improvements in fluidity and increases in the speed of the network, when the net -- so you have got a compounding effect. You are short of employees and you can\u2019t run the trains, so the network slows down. When the network slows down, you need more people. So we need to get the railroad back staffed, so that we can get the velocity and dwell down to where it was, that will then right-size our workforce to what we need and then we can more effectively manage it with the view that Kevin and his team provide us about where the opportunity is. Listen, they are not -- Kevin and his team are not shy about telling us on a regular basis where they see opportunity. It\u2019s out there. And we want to get it, we want to move it, because that\u2019s what we do and make a lot of money doing it. Ken Hoexter : And just to clarify there, the timing for the fluidity returned, is that by the third quarter year end? Jim Foote : Well, I would hope, again, I hate to give projections, because I was already off by nine months on the last one. We will -- yeah, you will see Mr. Boychuk always gets nervous when I start making projections. I wonder railroad is going to start running better. The railroad will start running better in this quarter and it will get better in the third quarter and it will get better in the fourth quarter. And the operating performance of the company I hope then will continue to get better and better and better and better all the time. 2019 was not nirvana. 2019 is the base camp we want to get back to where we were which was record level of performance, but there was not where we were satisfied being the way we wanted to run the company and run the railroad. We wanted to get even better from there and we hopefully will be able to do that. But it\u2019s going to be a gradual improvement as we go through the remainder of this year. Ken Hoexter : Jim and team, I appreciate the time. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much, Operator. Good afternoon, everyone. I just want to ask a little bit on yields and there\u2019s a lot of moving parts there with fuel surcharges and accessorial charges. Just curious how you would point investors to how your yield might develop over on a year-over-year basis going forward, particularly we are -- if we were to assume fuel prices remain constant. Are we going to see yields come down as some of these accessorial charges come off as fluidity improves, and therefore, should we be more looking at negative yield as opposed to our natural inclination in the rail sector to see pricing levels generally move higher. Could we see some noise in the near-term as a result of some of the rollover of -- as you are fluidity improves and some of those charges come off? Kevin Boone : Hey. This is Kevin. I -- when you look at what\u2019s happening right now, certainly I think Sean spoke to it. We would expect some of the storage fees and those things that come down to more normalized level. But that\u2019s a good thing. That means that supply chain is becoming more fluid. I mean we are moving more freight with the rail network that\u2019s exactly what we want to happen and so from that perspective that\u2019s all good. When we looked at where we are today versus where we were last quarter when we had this call, inflation is gone up even more and we are having to have those conversations with our customer. We re-price about 50% to 60% of our business every year and we are having those conversations, because our customers are having those conversations with their customers. And so that\u2019s the environment we are in, so there is a bit of a lag when you think about pricing and realization of that we are have to realize through the year and we fully expect that those things will start to deliver as we move through the year. Walter Spracklin : That\u2019s great color. Appreciate it. Thank you. Kevin Boone : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Fadi Chamoun : Hey. Thank you. Maybe the question is to Kevin. I think you mentioned in your remark something about the supply chain changes that we are experiencing now and maybe trade flows and you mentioned that you see an opportunity for CSX\u2019s network and specifically at the port. I am wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on that. And the second kind of point attached to that is, what do you would like to accomplish with the Pan Am specifically in terms of commercial and what carriers of traffic you think you have commercial opportunities to go after as you close on that transaction? Kevin Boone : Sure. In terms of trade flows, what I was referring to there is, probably two issues. One I touched on the second slide that I covered we are seeing a lot more activity in terms of industrial re-shoring, more appetite for companies look at their supply chain. And quite frankly, supply chain resiliency is a competitive advantage now and companies are re-evaluating, do I want my production in Asia or do I wanted to overseas or would it be more appropriate to have an onshore closer to the consumers that are going to be buying the products and I am hopeful and we are seeing early signs, that\u2019s the case that they are making those decisions and spending capital behind it. The second one and this is extremely early and we are having a lot of conversations with customers, and Jim talked about this a little bit is, when you think about things like grain, which have largely huge amounts of supply of come out of the Ukraine and Russia and the Europe and other commodities and steel products and other things that are largely gone in the European market. Well, all of a sudden doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to happen and some of those things that we had traditionally moved out of the West Coast to supply Asia. Now maybe that\u2019s going to come out of the East Coast and benefit the ports that we serve. And again it\u2019s really, really early. We have to have conversations. We have to make sure that the capabilities are there to be able to deliver those products when that demand happens. So we are staying very, very close to the customer. Understanding what could potentially move from the West Coast potentially into the East Coast and working with them and being really dynamic in terms of how we think about it. That\u2019s what I am thinking about. We are looking at everything that\u2019s going out the ports today and how that could change over the next few months and it\u2019s probably, it\u2019s not a next month phenomenon, it\u2019s probably six months, nine months, 12 months from now, we are going to really start to see some impact if it happens. Fadi Chamoun : Okay. And let me\u2026 JB How we see on the Pan Am\u2026 Fadi Chamoun : Yeah. Sorry. JB You want me to cover Pan Am? Fadi Chamoun : Yeah. Please. JB Yeah. And then on Pan Am, look, it\u2019s a very good consumer market. There is a lot of paper packaging customers that want more access to markets that we serve. The waste business in that market is going to continue to grow. We see great opportunities there. And we think with a better rail service, that\u2019s going to open up many more markets that quite frankly, just from a transit time or reliability standpoint just we were unable to serve previously. So we are really excited, we are gearing up now that the approval has gone through and going to work closely to really capture those opportunities. Fadi Chamoun : Okay. Thanks. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is now open. David Vernon : Hey. Good afternoon guys. I have a question for you on the appetite to grow sort of the intermodal business generally. I mean I think trimming some of the intermodal network as part of PSR was the first step and we are, obviously, dealing with some of these service issues. But I am curious to get your help on reconciling kind of where market rates are, how attractive the margin that growth could be and what do you make of the third-party industry sort of adding something like 50,000 boxes to the fleet this year and coming out with a even bigger number for the next couple of years. I mean is this a market that you guys really want to lever into or are you going to remain a little bit more balanced between intermodal and merchandise growth? I am just trying to square the circle with what we are seeing in the container order book for the domestic players and your appetite to actually accommodate some of that growth? Jim Foote : Well, I think, we are leading the industry in intermodal growth. So it is not in terms of volume. I think if not this year, next year for sure. In terms of volume, intermodal is going to be our biggest piece of business. That being said, so we want to -- we spent a lot of time and effort in 2017 and 2018 in re-engineering the way the intermodal network operated for reasons, so that we could have a good return on that business when we began to focus more intently on working in the key lanes where it makes sense for us to grow. We are beginning to I think have a better understanding of leveraging the East Coast ports, which have gone through a dramatic transformation in terms of growth versus the West Coast and have the much greater opportunity to expand that footprint in the East than they do in the West. And we are also working more and more and more at how we can participate in the Mexican intermodal market, which to-date we do basically nothing in. So whether it\u2019s international or domestic, the more players put asset towards the intermodal market, the more these markets further develop, we see great potential for us to continue to grow our intermodal franchise. That\u2019s not to say that we are in any way shape or form favoring that over the merchandise business. The merchandise business is a core part of our franchise. So we intend to grow both of these businesses. We see both of them as equal opportunity. Any business has a divergent book of business and so we don\u2019t -- we look at them both as exciting areas of opportunity. David Vernon : And Jim, and maybe just a quick follow-up, as you think about the UMAX fleet, do you look into add boxes to that, are you going to let the third-party sort of private fleet handle the investment in the actual boxes? Jim Foote : Again that\u2019s a different book of business. Personally I am more in favor of us being more involved on an asset ownership basis, because we see great opportunity there for potential and whether it\u2019s UMAX or whether it\u2019s every place else, I don\u2019t like the model where 95% of the work and get 75% of the money. So to the extent that we can turn some of this business around and make it more favorable to our bottomline, I can guarantee you that any kind of an investment in asset in that area would have a great return. David Vernon : Thanks very much. Jim Foote : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Your line is now open. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much. Good afternoon. In terms of the outlook for coal, you had touched on RPU already, but I wonder if you could comment on what you think the prospect is for increased coal volume this year? And within that, could you touch on whether it\u2019s primarily export coal that has influenced your outlook on both domestic and export? Sean Pelkey : Yeah. I think when you look at some of the discrete items that I pointed out in the first quarter, we think some of those obviously are going to go away as we get through the year and then Jamie talked a lot about the additional resources we are adding and I think there are opportunities as the mines reinvest and they are making a lot of money right now and that allows them to reinvest in probably some deferred capital that they have had over the years. You would see some -- probably some better production coming out of those as well. So all else equal, if the market stays strong, we would anticipate some volume upside through the year. Cherilyn Radbourne : And is it primarily export coal that\u2019s influence your outlook or is that to look at next\u2026 Sean Pelkey : No. No. When you look at Southern utilities, oh, sorry, yeah, I didn\u2019t address that when you look at our Southern utilities and even our Northern Utilities right now they are at low levels. And so there is an inventory replenishment that needs to happen that we are working diligently on and working closely with them the -- and with the mines to make sure that happens into the summer peak season. And then on the export side, that is then obviously very, very robust in terms of the demand. You are now seeing some -- probably some thermal opportunities with supply not there coming out of Russia and so we will see how that materializes. Right now, it\u2019s not a lack of demand, it\u2019s a supply constrained market and you have seen the coal producers probably favor that export met business rather than the thermal business. And Curtis Bay, you will see that. Jamie, just remind me that will come on in the third quarter and I will offer some additional opportunity as that comes back on the full capacity. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thank you for the time. Operator : Your last question today comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. Just curious on the auto sector, if you give a little color around that, what you are hearing from the OEMs, maybe how the parts business is doing and any update on the chip situation? Thanks. Sean Pelkey : Yeah. We certainly saw some improvement in the March and that\u2019s continued into April, when we started shipping cars without chips, I guess that helps. So some of that inventory that was sitting on the ground, waiting for chip to come in, they just decided to go ahead and ship it in maybe you don\u2019t have a sea warmer right now, but you will get it in maybe in six months from now. But -- so that we seeing a lot more finished good inventory on the ground and we are ramping up to deliver those products in the market. So that\u2019s -- but we will see what some of the impacts in China with some of the disruption there having over there with that, the variant running through there and Shanghai shutting down and some other areas, so it\u2019s a watch item, but we are seeing some favorability at least in the near-term. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 2022 CSX Corporation Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Matthew Korn : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter call. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, our Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In our presentation, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on slide two, followed by our non-GAAP disclosures. And with that, it will be my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim Foote : Thank you, Matthew and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'll start by expressing my thanks to all CSX's employees for their hard work during another quarter of tough operating conditions. And I am very pleased to welcome everyone from Pan Am who joined the CSX team in June. We look forward to working together to build new single-line service across our combined network. Our second quarter results were solid as we continue to benefit from strong customer demand and firm pricing. But our ability to hire and retain new workers, which is vital to improving our service and growing the business, remains challenged. We are not alone in facing this problem. The labor market is tight, prospective recruits have many job options and the pandemic has had a profound effect on employees' work and lifestyle preferences. Our truck hiring process has been steady, but slow. We will not let up in our efforts to grow our engineer and conductor headcount and improve network fluidity to pre-pandemic levels. Since the time of our last earnings call, our uncertainty and volatility have clearly increased in the financial markets and in parts of the economy. Inflationary pressures have moved higher and interest rates have risen. We're staying diligent by keeping in close touch with our customers, monitoring our order rates, and constantly updating our forecasts. But what remains constant is that right now, as we have seen this entire year, there is more demand for rail service than what we are able to satisfy. The efforts we are making now to grow our workforce and add capacity to our network are not just a status by current demand. We are investing because we see plentiful long-term opportunities for rail, driven by customer demand for more fuel-efficient, environmentally friendly transportation options, and growth in domestic manufacturing. We're excited about our potential, but to realize it, we must focus on near-term execution. Our entire team is aligned in our goals and I look forward to keeping you updated in our progress in the quarters ahead. Turning to our presentation. Let's start with Slide 4, which highlights our second quarter key financial results. We moved nearly 1.6 million carloads in the quarter and generated over $3.8 billion in revenue. Operating income was $1.7 billion, which includes a $122 million gain from our Virginia real estates sale. Recall that in the second quarter of 2021, we recognized a much larger $349 million gain from this transaction. Earnings per share increased 4% to $0.54 a share, which also includes a smaller contribution from the Virginia sale compared to a year ago. And our operating ratio was 55.4%, which includes a 320 basis point tailwind from the Virginia real estate gain but also includes combined headwinds of roughly 450 basis points from the impact of quality carriers, higher fuel prices and Pan Am acquisition costs. I'll now turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for details. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 5. Second quarter revenue increased 28% year-over-year with revenue growth across merchandise, coal and intermodal. Overall volumes were flat, where we saw strong demand across many of our markets, limited by resource constraints across the supply chain. Merchandise revenue increased 10% on flat volume, driven by price and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Looking at some of the highlights. We are encouraged by strength in automotive market, where revenues rose 24% on a 10% increase in volume. There are clear signs from auto manufacturers that semiconductor challenges are easing. Our minerals business benefited from improved shipments of aggregates in salt. Our ag and food segment saw growth from ethanol and export drains. Less favorable was our fertilizer business, where volumes and revenues declined year-over-year on reduced phosphate shipments. Volatile fertilizer prices, combined with some production issues, impacted volumes in the quarter. Forest products along with metals and equipment saw positive revenue growth, offset by modest declines in volumes, mainly driven by resource constraints. Intermodal revenue increased 18% on 1% higher volume as growth in the international business was partially offset by lower domestic shipments, driven by continued equipment challenges through the quarter. Intermodal demand remains strong and customers continue to recognize our industry-leading service product in a challenged market. Coal revenue increased 54% on 3% lower volume. As we have discussed, coal demand remains strong across our domestic and international markets. Volumes have been constrained by production issues at the mine, infrastructure constraints at the port, including Curtis Bay and general man power shortages, including crews. We still expect volumes to improve through the year as some of these constraints moderate. Other revenue increased primarily due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage. Although macro uncertainty is clearly elevated as we enter into the second half, we still see positive drivers favoring rail, including environmental benefits as customers prioritize ESG, lack of truck capacity with driver shortages, onshoring of industrial production and inflation that will all benefit our growth opportunities. Currently, we are still seeing demand in many markets limited by the global shortage of labor. We believe this will continue to benefit rail's value proposition and the opportunity to increase mobile share over time. Going forward, we remain committed to making the investments needed to serve our customers and helping them grow their business. Let me now turn it over to Jamie to discuss operations. Jamie Boychuk : Thanks, Kevin. Safety remains our top priority at CSX, and operating safely is a critical foundation to achieving any of our operating goals. We work hard to instill a culture of safety across our railroad, and this begins with the moment that our employees enter our training facility. We focus not only on teaching employees the right way to work, but creating an environment that facilitates ongoing coaching and education our safety protocols. This is particularly important for the almost 700 new T&E employees that have completed training year-to-date. The coaching does not end with the training program. We have created new programs to significantly increase touch points with managers to ensure new employees are protecting both themselves and their fellow railroads. These efforts have helped drive another strong quarter of safety results. In the second quarter, injury rate increased modestly from the near record levels in the first quarter but remained flat year-over-year. Train accidents ticked up slightly in the prior quarter, but continued their positive trend as we focused on minimizing human factor accidents through proactive employee communications. Turning to slide 7. We remain committed to delivering strong service and we are taking action to improve network performance. We are seeing signs of this improved performance in our local service measures. This is our second consecutive quarter of improved results, and our best since exiting the pandemic downturn in 2020. We continue to actively coordinate with customers to further improve these metrics and are encouraged that we are seeing some of the largest improvement in some of the areas that were most challenged entering the year. Our intermodal trip plan performance remained strong and crossed back above the 90% threshold this quarter. Looking forward, we continue to focus on keeping terminals open and fluid during the ongoing supply chain constraints. We expect merchandise performance to improve throughout the second half of the year as network fluidity increases. To offset the impact of crew shortages, we have added additional assets to the network to better meet our customer commitments. As employees mark up, we will be able to refine the network plan to reduce congestion, shorten transit times and improve reliability. Now turning to slide 8 and our ongoing hiring initiatives. We continue to have a strong hiring pipeline that averaged over 500 trainees in the second quarter. This pipeline will allow us to continue filling classes as we work towards our headcount targets. For the second consecutive quarter, over 300 conductors qualified and total active T&E increased to nearly 6,700 employees. We expect this number to increase sequentially throughout the second half as our newly qualified more than offset attrition. In addition to focusing on hiring, we are also working to minimize attrition. These initiatives will help us with our new hires throughout the early years of their career, including a recent agreement that will lift the pay for newly qualified conductors. As I said last quarter, this will all take time, but we know that to deliver our service we must have the right level of resources and that starts with our people. I'll now hand over to Sean to review our financial results. Sean Pelkey : Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon. In the face of these challenging labor market conditions as well as ongoing supply chain issues, CSX delivered over $800 million in revenue growth with gains across all major markets. Expenses were also up over $800 million and as a result, reported operating income increased 1%. However, as I will explain in more detail on the next slide, costs were heavily impacted by lower real estate gains, the addition of Quality Carriers, and transaction costs and higher fuel. Interest expense was $10 million favorable to the prior year, while other income improved $6 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.4%. Turning to the next slide. Total costs increased $813 million. Nearly $500 million of the higher expense was due to the inclusion of Quality Carriers, lower gains on property dispositions, and Pan Am acquisition costs. Real estate gains were driven by the Virginia transaction, with a $122 million impact this quarter versus $349 million in the prior year. This represents our last significant gain from Virginia and we expect to receive the remaining $125 million of cash proceeds in the fourth quarter. Higher fuel prices were also a significant factor with fuel expense up over $200 million, excluding the Quality impact. Not surprisingly, inflation is running above historical levels. And the $56 million on this slide represents inflation across labor, purchased services, and rents. All other expenses increased by $50 million, with approximately $20 million higher depreciation, about $10 million lower incentive compensation expense, and nearly $40 million of higher operating costs. This $40 million reflects increased hiring and retention, the impact of a larger active locomotive fleet, intermodal terminal costs from supply chain disruptions, and slower car cycle times. As service levels normalize in the coming quarters, we would expect the opportunity set on the expense side to come first from these operating categories. Now, turning to cash flow on slide 11. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow before dividends is down by approximately $125 million, but up about $75 million when adjusting for proceeds from the Virginia transaction in the prior year. Capital spending is up nearly $6 0 million and for the full year, we still expect to invest approximately $2 billion in our network. This ensures safety and reliability with roughly 8 0% of these investments going to the core infrastructure and a growing amount being allocated to strategic and return-based projects. After fully funding capital demands, year-to-date shareholder returns have exceeded $2.9 billion, including over $2.5 billion in buybacks and over $400 million in dividends. This brings our cash and short-term investment balance down to a more normalized $800 million. And as we go forward, we will remain both balanced and opportunistic in our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Foote : Great. Thanks, Sean. Let's conclude on Slide 12 with our outlook for the year. Having benefited from high export coal prices over the first half of the year and with fuel prices still elevated, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth for the full year. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our customer demand for rail freight remains greater than what we're currently able to supply. Export coal benchmarks have moderated over the last couple of months, but our guidance had already anticipated a correction over the second half of the year. Consistent with our commentary all year, we believe that increasing our train and engine employee headcount is the key factor necessary for improved service and network performance and our hiring efforts will continue. Our aim is still to reach an active transportation headcount of 7,000 as soon as possible. As Sean said, full year capital expenditures are planned at approximately $2 billion, which is also unchanged, as is our commitment to return excess capital to our shareholders. As we stressed last quarter, we are moving forward, but real progress takes time and is often challenging and gradual. There is plenty left to do, but the whole CSX family is committed to delivering on our goals, supporting our customers and growing this company. Thank you. And I'll turn it back to Matthew. Matthew Korn : Thank you, Jim. Now as we start Q&A, in the interest of time, I\u2019d ask that everyone, please limit yourselves to one and just one question. And with that, operator, we will now take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So if I look, headcount's down sequentially, excluding Pan Am. And you guys were the first rail to talk about ramping up hiring, but perhaps maybe struggling the most. Curious, why do you think that is? And then maybe just separately for Kevin, any thoughts on just guidance on other revenue and coal RPU in the third quarter? Thank you. Jim Foote : Well, hi, Scott, I'll take the first part of your question about the hiring. And yes. I don't know if we're struggling more than everybody else or not, I think everybody is struggling. We've hired over the last two years since we started talking about this issue, which we saw coming again a couple of years ago, 2,000 employees and our numbers haven't gone backwards. So the question has been not really as much as our ability to -- with employees into the pipeline and get them through the process, but a much, much higher attrition rate than we had expected from our current workforce. And a significantly higher attrition rate from the new people that we brought on. Unfortunately, after we get them through the classroom training part and the on-the-job training part and they actually go to work in the outdoor operating environment, we've seen a significantly higher attrition rate than what we had ever normally experienced or than what we had anticipated. So I think as we -- a couple of us, Jamie and myself, Sean mentioned during here, we've done a lot of work in terms of focusing on attrition now in terms of what we can do from a compensation standpoint to make sure that we keep the employees that we invest in. And so I think that is the -- I think that's the issue. I also what I said was we had a target out there of 7,000 people. And based upon where we stand today with the number of people that should be qualifying over the next two to three months, we certainly hope when we put that target out there, our employee -- number of employees off at that time was around 20 or so daily with COVID, it's now north of 80 to 90. So we hope that number comes down. And if those two factors come through as we expect and as we plan, we'll hit that 7,000 number. It's achievable by the end of the third quarter. Kevin Boone : Yes. And then on the coal RPU, look, obviously, the met coal prices have come down, as everybody has seen. Our expectation right now, given where things are, is probably you'll look at the RPU in line with what we saw in the first quarter, so a little bit down from the second quarter. And then on the other revenue line, supplemental other revenue, probably something flattish versus this quarter outside of the market changing dramatically, which we don't see right now. Scott Group : Thank you guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Bascome Majors : Thanks for taking my question. Sean, there's obviously some uncertainty as to what the actual union wage increases from 2024 will ultimately be. Can you talk about how CSX has managed that uncertainty with its accruals so far? And if the actual wage increases were to come in different than your expectations, when do you true that up retroactively communicated prospectively? Thanks. Sean Pelkey : Yes, Bascome, I can speak to that. So when we look at the union wage issue, we have been accruing for increased wages ever since the expiration of the last contract. When we do get to a settlement, we'll take a look back at that and see if an adjustment is necessary. If it is, we would take that all at once. And it's probably also worth noting that we've been accruing four back wages, which means that when we do get to a settlement, the employees who've been working with us for several years and not getting wage increases will likely get backpay. So there will be a cash impact around the time of whenever that settlement occurs. Bascome Majors : In that accrual in this period where we don't have certainty, has that been consistent with historic rail inflation or different reflecting the environment we're in today? Sean Pelkey : Yes, Bascome. I'm not at liberty to give any specific insight in terms of what we, CSX, are accruing. That's sort of based on our best guess of where the negotiations come out. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is open. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good afternoon. I guess I want to go back to the headcount question a little bit in the network operation. You have made some progress on active T&E headcount and yet at the same time, it seems like the velocity metrics really haven't necessarily reflected that. So, I was wondering if you could offer thoughts maybe why that would be the case. And then also just like level of confidence that 7,000 is the right number. Is that pretty good visibility? I mean you talked about end of third quarter, if you achieve that, should we expect to see stronger volume and just a lot of confidence that, that's really the right number and you don't need to go beyond that. Thank you. Jamie Boychuk : Thanks Tom. I'll first touch on our number. We feel quite comfortable that 7,000 gets us to a pre-pandemic level, which is where we were, but that doesn't mean we're stopping at 7,000. We're going to continue to hire, obviously, for growth that Kevin had mentioned that is still out there that is untapped really. So, 7,000 is a number that we feel comfortable that gets us to our metrics and our trains -- less train delay and everything else that's going out on the mainline and other locations. So, we're comfortable with that number for that reason, but we're not stopping there. I want to make that clear. We still got to make sure that we continue to hire for the anticipated growth over the next year or two. With respect to the numbers, you're right; we have seen an increase in our T&E quarter-over-quarter, if I look at my averages. And look at every week, we've got 20 to 30 folks who are qualifying in the conductor ranks, which in different areas is making a difference for us and helping us. But the last few months have really been a high peak for vacation for us. So, seasonably, our availability for our employees are usually 84%, 85%, but over the past couple of months, because of the seasonality of vacation, our availability really has dropped about 80% to 81%. So, every one percentage point equals somewhere close to 70 employees. So, if you start backing that out and thinking about what that means for the network, we're all feeling that vacation crunch, and we're going to be into that until probably Labor Day into September when the vacations start to back off. So, that's part of the reason why you're seeing numbers climbing, but yet our velocity and other areas of our railroad aren't seeing the benefits of it. Jim Foote : Tom, it's Jim, too. And we've learned a lot over the last 18 months in terms about -- what the current state of affairs are when it comes to hiring and the difficulties associated with that, which were not fair historically. And so there's a lot of -- at the end of this quarter, are we going to know what our attrition -- what our true long-term attrition rates are going to be, where we know -- are we going to be in a situation where we get hit with another surge of some variants, and we have another couple of hundred employees off at any given time. So, we're trying to get back to the number that we put out publicly is what we had in 2019 when the -- end of 2019, early 2020 when the railroad is really running at a record performance. And so that's -- it's kind of a starting point for us to have better visibility as to what we should really do going forward. Tom Wadewitz : Great. Thanks for the perspective. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open. David Vernon : Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. So the last two quarters, you've been running whatever, high single-digits in -- of employees and training relative to your active T&E account. I'm just wondering, after we get past this more employees would be better than fewer, what's the right number do you think long term to be thinking about in terms of employees and training relative to the active headcount? I'm just assuming that you're incurring some additional expense for having a much of the 7.5% of your active T&E account on the payroll, but not necessarily haul and freight. I was just trying to figure out how the best way to normalize that. So any thoughts on that, Sean, would be really helpful. Jim Foote : David, let me answer that. It's kind of confused to what I just said a few moments ago. We're going to have to learn our way through this as we get into the end of this year and beginning of next year to have a better understanding of what these attrition rates are. It's been somewhat of a surprise to all of us, the number of people that have dropped out after again, going through all of the classroom training, all of the on-the-job training and then working a few months and deciding that they don't like railroading as a profession. And so these are all new things for us. So one thing we know, we can easily manage down just simply by taking advantage of attrition if that's what's necessary. What we do know it's a lot more -- what we have experienced anyway in the recent times here, it's a lot more difficult for us to manage up. So in the short term, we're going to learn about what we need to do differently and how we need to do it. And until that point in time, we're going to do everything we can to not run short. David Vernon : Okay. So I get that it's probably too early to figure out what that number should settle at. But I guess if you think about kind of the -- what you're hearing from the folks that are bouncing out pretty quickly, is there some qualitative sort of assessment that you can share with us in terms of the rationale for why some of these folks are leaving what has historically been a pretty attractive job? Jim Foote : Well, we're trying to do analysis of every different type to try and figure out why, so we don't make the -- so if we can identify factors we don't bring people in because there's a lot of cost and time and effort associated with training somebody. So we're trying to -- we're trying to do a psychological union at whatever analytics we can do to try and help us better -- have a better understanding of the profile of worker that we need to hire upfront. And this is just new for us and -- but we're learning and we'll get it figured out, and then we'll be able to better manage on a more consistent basis, the headcount. David Vernon : All right. Thanks very much for your time. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Your line is open. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe could you help us a little bit with your expectations around volume in the second half of the year and sort of how you think that, that might play out? And then, I guess, maybe a little bit bigger picture. I think there's just a general sense that there's more demand out there than you guys are able to capture. So as you see operating performance and headcount improve, there's the ability to sort of lean into that. Can you sort of help us with your confidence around demand levels in the back half, what you're hearing from the customer? Are you seeing anything slow down? So just kind of curious about, generally speaking, the volume and demand dynamics as you go into the back half of the year? Kevin Boone : Hey Chris, this is Kevin. As I mentioned and Jim mentioned it, I think, a couple of times, demand continues to outstrip supply chain. We're not alone. It's the supply chain in general, and we're part of that supply chain with the crew issue that we're having. Right now, if you look at the back half of the year, when you look on just a purely comp basis, we have easy comps on the auto business, and we clearly have seen that production start to pick up the here. So we're encouraged on what's happening there. We've had some disruption on the coal side of the business. So we think that will continue to improve in the back half of the year. So there are some things that just from a comparison point of view get better as we move into the back half of the year. And then as the crews come online, we'll go and get -- chase those opportunities that we know are out there in terms of market share and then the existing opportunities that we know that are out there in terms of order fill rates, things like that, that we're highly focused on as a team and see the opportunity going forward. So nothing has really changed from the last quarter when we see a pretty robust environment, but we're not -- we're also keeping an eye on what's going on. Clearly, the housing markets had some pressure out there, but we have exposure there, but there's other areas where, quite frankly, there's a lot of inventory restocking that still needs to happen. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. So if operations get better, then the volume goes up, I think as simple as that as far as you guys are concerned, right? Kevin Boone : Yes, that's our view, given the demand environment that we're seeing right now. Chris Wetherbee : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ari Rosa : Hey good afternoon guys, and congrats on a solid result here. Jim, I was hoping I could just get your reaction to the announcement of a presidential emergency board in relation to the negotiations with the union. Do you see any risk around your ability to achieve margin targets based on that appointment or based on these negotiations? And alternatively, do you think that maybe some of these attrition issues could be solved if there's a resolution to some of these labor negotiations stand still that you've been facing? Jim Foote : Well, we're glad that the emergency board was appointed. It's unfortunately, as I've said quite often, that it took so long to -- for us to get to this point. But the wall has worked for a long, long time, and we're hopeful that the emergency board puts out a recommendation, it's a win-win for both sides. Do we hope that once the labor issue is resolved -- and our employees are not happy that they didn't get a raise for 2.5 years, let me tell you that. They tell me that all the time. And so we're hopeful that once this is resolved, and we're expecting that they'll get a very better rate is that that will help with morale and that might help with the retention. And then final, the Board are seasoned veterans of dealing with labor issues and they are going to make a recommendation based upon the inputs and hearing from both sides. And as I said, I hope it comes out that it's a reasonable win-win solution. And if that's the case, we're certainly able to accommodate that in our economics going forward. Ari Rosa : Understood. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good afternoon. Jamie, when we look at the weekly metrics, obviously, we've already addressed we're moving in the wrong direction, yet your intermodal trip plan performance back to 90%. Your volumes, which I'm sure you're disappointed with, but probably not as bad as some others or maybe what the metrics would be indicating. Can you speak a little bit to that apparent disconnect where velocity dwell moving one way, volumes kind of rebounding in other? And if you get to that velocity dwell that you're targeting with the right resources, how much free capacity that would free up for your network? Jamie Boychuk : Yes, Jon, look, it's a great question. It comes down to the hard work of those operating folks on the ground, right from the union folks who are working, Dan and Dale, for us that are working more than they ever have filling in some of those gaps. But the operating team is just doing a fantastic job from the network side to the guys out in the field, making tough decisions. And in this environment, look at intermodal has a priority on our railroad. We make sure that the intermodal trains get across within their schedule for the best that we can. We're in an environment where we have concerns to make sure that chickens get fed and then the utility and the lights stay on. So, there's times when we actually have to prioritize some of our bulk traffic, which we would never have done before because normally bulk traffic goes to a stockpile. So, when you are prioritizing different flows of traffic that you never really had before, it goes against a little bit of your principles of making sure you take care of that merchandise traffic. At times the merchandise traffic might take a 24-hour delay or something across the network getting from terminal-to-terminal. So, that's where you're seeing some of those areas where we're just not moving as quick as we could and some of the congestion that's out there. So, yes, you're absolutely right that when we can get back to a little bit normalized workforce with respect to being able to move every train and not having to make those tough decisions on this week. We're worried about the lights in the Southern Carolina area or we're worried about the chickens down in Alabama or different areas, yes, you're going to start to see that flow move better and the capacity. Back in 2019, we talked about it a lot. We have a lot of capacity on this network. We have a great network. We have more than enough assets out there. As a matter of fact, I've always said and I stand by it, that hiring the folks that we are and any expenses that come along with that, we're going to be able to pull that out through assets. So, we're quite confident that we're making the right moves that we can today in order to try to keep everybody happy. But the one metric I did talk about is that the customer metric is, if you want to call it that first mile, last mile metric, which is something we're watching to continue to improve that we're showing up with the customers. They may get -- merchandise customers may have a 24-hour delay in transit time. But when we're actually showing up when we say we're going to be there and the cars we say we're going to bring in are coming in, that's making a difference to those customers, and that's something that we're continuing to work on to be able to give the customers a better experience than what they're feeling. So, don't -- the metrics that are out there, you're right. They're not the way we want them to be. I wouldn't be fooled completely by how you read into some of those metrics because we're running the railroad differently. And my final comment really on this is it's the hard-working folks who are out there running this operation are doing a fantastic job with the tools they have. Jim Foote : Yes. This is Jim. Just a follow-up to what Jamie said, where the railroad is running in 2019, which was at record phenomenal rates in terms of reliability, velocity dwell, et cetera. At that point in time, we always kind of talked about the fact that without doing much to the rail network, we had an additional 25% to 30% of capacity available that we have freed up over the prior two years with the changes that we've made. And during the last 2.5 years, 2020, 2021, we did not slow down on our capital program. We continue to invest in the road. We continue to extend sidings, all because it just makes -- we're preparing for normalcy to return plus it creates a lot of efficiency across the network. So we're in great shape to handle whatever traffic comes to us whenever we get. We only have one restriction on us right now and it's crews, and we're doing everything we can possibly do to hire as many people as we can. Jon Chappell : Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is open. Justin Long : Thanks. I know previously, you had talked about volumes this year, outpacing GDP growth. I was curious if that's still your expectation. And Sean, last quarter, you gave some color on your expectations for operating expenses ex-fuel on a sequential basis. I was curious if you could do that again for the third quarter especially with Pan Am being layered in. Kevin Boone : Hey, Justin, it's Kevin. Nothing has really changed with our outlook. Obviously, the GDP number is moving out around quite a bit, but that's -- a lot has changed since the beginning of the year. Clearly, inflation has moved up a lot more than what people believe coming into the year. And so we've -- that's probably been more reflected in price. And then on the volume side, probably not as quick of a recovery from a supply chain as we anticipated, but still given the favorable comp comparisons that we have in the back half of the year, we expect growth. Sean Pelkey : And Justin, on the second part of the question around OpEx, I think it's fair to assume that OpEx is going to be fairly stable quarter-over-quarter. We will begin accruing for higher wages, the compounding impact of higher wages that would reset at mid-year. So you should see a little bit of an increase sequentially in the labor line. And to your Pan Am question, recognized on a fully integrated basis, it's about 1% of revenue or a little less than that. Figure the operating ratio on that business today is a little worse than our average and then spread the cost similar to our current spread, and that will probably get you there in terms of the Pan Am impact. But everything else relatively stable and the hope would be as crews continue to mark up and become available towards the latter part of next quarter as the vacation peak subsides, the network begins spinning, we begin to take some of those $40 million or so of costs out. Justin Long : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the time. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Kevin, I just wanted to ask about yields in the back half of the year relative to where they were in the second quarter. There's a few puts and takes. I mean, obviously, fuel is moderating off of a very high level. So maybe that's a little bit of a debit to yield. Then we're, obviously, still in a high inflationary environment, so maybe there's some pricing opportunity. So I understand mix is going to be what it is. So if we can just kind of hold that to the side for a minute. Could you just talk about maybe how you think back half yields would be relative to what you did in the second quarter? And then, Sean, that was really helpful on the cost comment, non-fuel costs. I guess with fuel moderating, that optically releases some pressure on EOR. So would you kind of expect EOR to continue sliding down in the back half of the year? Obviously, not as big of a jump improvement from 1Q to 2Q. But would you expect the sliding down of OR in the back half of the year as well? Thank you. Kevin Boone : Hey, on the yields, I think you covered one of them. Obviously, the fuel surcharge and there's a bit of a lag there as we move from second quarter and third quarter. So that can move around quite a bit, but you understand how that works and we'll adjust as that moves around a bit on the diesel prices. The other one that I covered earlier was really on the export coal pricing. What we're seeing today is obviously some moderation of the really, really high prices. The environment is still very, really good for us. We would take these price levels any day. It's just that they're coming off the stream level. So we'll see some moderation there. But outside of that, clearly, when we're having contract negotiations with our customers, they understand the high inflation environment we're dealing with today. And obviously, on the labor side and other parts of our business, and we're having to recapture that value in those discussions. So as things reprice, we're or making sure we stay in line with what's happening out there in the market and what we're having to pay expense-wise. So we probably would still see some underlying momentum there as well. But outside of that, nothing really changes into the back half of the year. Sean Pelkey : Yes. And just adding to that, in terms of the operating ratio, I think the two things that are non-core or less inside our control, we had about $85 million in real estate gains last year. We're, obviously, always working on potential deals, but we'll see whether we have a similar number that materialize in the second half. And then fuel, if prices tail down and continue to go down, we'll have that favorable lag benefit that will help the OR. But if you set both of those items aside, we have sequential volumes gains into the second half of the year and expenses are relatively flat, excluding PanAm [ph] and the wage increase impact. And I think it would be fair to assume that we'll continue to have some good momentum on the margin side. Amit Mehrotra : Right. Okay. Very good. Thanks for the help. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to go back to the comments on -- Jim, I think you made a comment about offering a little bit more incentives or compensation for some of the folks that are coming on to the network? Or are there any other things you can do to break down that rate of attrition with other things, or you do have to wait on the official agreement to get settled? And where do you think that might be? And then for Jamie, are there any other things you would consider, we saw one of the Western rails put in embargo, which is pretty disruptive, but I seem to get them a little bit of relief. Is that something that you would consider at this point? Or would that be unnecessary? Jim Foote : Well, we're working on a unionized environment, and we're not able to do too much without an agreement with the unions, including increasing their pay, but we have tried many options, and we'll continue to work -- to do whatever we can to try and change the working environment so that people feel -- like Dave, really want to work here, simple as that. And so it's an ongoing process like everything is. And so we don't have any silver bullets. We're making it up, but to a large degree, as we go along because these are all uncertain times and experiences that we've never had before, including myself, I've been doing this all my life. But we'll continue to innovate. We'll continue to come up with ideas and try to make this the place where everybody wants to work. In terms of embargoes, in my opinion, an embargo was a pretty draconian step that one would not take without a lot, a lot, a lot of forethought and so we would only do embargoes if it was absolutely, absolutely necessary. And that's my position on it and that's where we're going to stay. Brian Ossenbeck : And then timing of the labor resolution, do you have any ideas on that? Or is it still too early to tell? Jim Foote : Timing in terms of the outcome of the current negotiations? Brian Ossenbeck : Yes. Jim Foote : Sometime in the next -- that will be done in the next 60 days is like -- well, you're in the second -- you got three 30-day cooling off period. You got one has expired, one encompasses the period of time where the emergency board hears, meets and my belief is they are not going to delay that. So, they will be done in a little less than 30 days, 28 days or whatever time is left for that. And then after that, there's another 30-day cooling off period where the parties will meet to either accept the recommendations of the emergency board. And if history plays that shows us what the outcome will likely be, if the parties don't agree, the government has stepped in and impose findings on the parties. That will be done. Brian Ossenbeck : All right. Thank you, Jim. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Walter Spracklin : Yes, thanks very much. Good afternoon. I guess you've had a chance to have at least an early look at an assessment of quality and have a sense of how it's fitting in with your network? And my question, I guess, from an acquisition standpoint, strategically, do you think, Jim, you need more of that type of business? Are you impressed enough about by what you've seen with quality that you would ask for -- or you would look for more opportunities like that in the, call it, trucking space or the specialized trucking space? Or do you think with what you got with quality is enough and you're happy with what you have and focused on more organic opportunities going forward? Jim Foote : Well, first of all, we're extremely impressed with Quality Carriers. They're a great company. They have great people. They do a great job. They're industry leaders, and that's what piqued our interest when they became available. But that's not the only reason that we pursued that. It was a fact that it aligned so well with our existing core business in the road and what comes first is our existing core business. So I don't see us necessarily going out and doing something along the lines of another quality of that size, unless it met those same criteria. And if it met those same criteria, then, of course, we'd be interested in it. But we're going to continue to try and expand our footprint through everything we've talked about on the trans flow and on the reloads and on the warehousing and everything we can do in those spaces that brings greater connectivity to the core rail network to our customers. So oftentimes, we don't go all the way to the door where there's a gap. And so whatever we can do to try and fill that gap between connecting the core railroad to a bigger base of customers, that's what intrigues us, and we'll continue to pursue that. Walter Spracklin : I appreciate that color, Jim. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good evening. Jim and team, I guess, on-time performance down at 50% originations, 62% last seen since well before PSR rollout at CSX and I think even before Hunter got there in 2017. So you don't think that this starts to affect your ability to win business on to the railroad with the service levels here? And I guess, if, Kevin, you're talking about the demand is there and you're turning it away, maybe talk about where your -- is that localized your specific parts of the network where it's harder to hire where you're seeing some of that push away? And then, Jim, can you just clarify the lift. You mentioned lift pay for newly qualified conductors. But you just said you can't -- to Brian, you said you can't do things without the union agreement. Maybe you can just clarify what you meant by that statement then. Jim Foote : Well, that means what I said. We obviously got a labor -- we obviously got the labor leadership to agree that we could pay the employees more. And so we couldn't just do that. I guess I would be concerned that we had slipped back to the points before to the metrics or operating performance metrics before we've done so much hard work over 2017, 2018 and 2019 in order to get this company running at spectacular rates. I find hard to believe that with our measurements that we are -- we're still doing an extremely good job under very difficult circumstances. It's clearly not like everybody else in the world is doing fantastic, and everybody is running at 100% on time and we're running at 62%. This is an issue that affects everybody in the logistics chain because it affects the truckers. This affects this kinship companies, this affects the terminal operators. This affects everybody. Everybody has slowed down, everybody is struggling and it's not just the railroad industry. As I was saying earlier today, I don't think Heathrow Airport ever thought they'd have to put an embargo because they can't handle air traffic through the facility. So it's a global phenomena. We're continuing to improve. As we said, we're continuing to do better. I can say one thing, we're the only railroad that I know of in North America that never shut a terminal down because we were congested so -- because we're intensely focused on the fact that everybody wanted to use e-commerce, and we were going to make sure we were there for the country when they needed us. So I'm very proud of the job this year that everybody did. So our other metrics, clearly, our velocity has stabilized. Our dwell has stabilized. We're beginning to turn the corner. I said, we're going to get to 60 -- 700 -- 7,000 employees when we said we would. And that's the plan, and that's what CSX is always done here in the last 4.5 years, and that's what we're going to do this time. Ken Hoexter : Great. Thanks Jim. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Your line is open. Jason Seidl : Thanks, operator. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I wanted to just clarify a little bit on the operating ratio. You talked about some of the puts and takes going forward. Obviously, the Pan Am costs aren't going to continue into the second half of the year. Just how much of that 450 basis point headwind was Pan Am in the quarter? Sean Pelkey : Yes, Jason, about 50 basis points was Pan Am. Jason Seidl : Okay. Just 50 basis points for Pan Am. And then if I could just follow-up really quick. You talked about how much demand, sort of, pent-up demand for rail that there is. And then if we just assume that you do start improving even more on the operational side, is it really intermodal and maybe boxcar that a lot of these gains are going to jump out in terms of where you can open up and take on business? Kevin Boone : I think it goes beyond just the intermodal and boxcar. You think about the coal network. And look, some of this is on the coal mines and some of the export facilities that have had a lot of issues as well. So it's -- we're part of that puzzle piece with the crew issue on that side of the business. But I would say it's a limited just the boxcar intermodal. When I think about some of the other markets like auto and we're playing a little bit of catch-up there as well. So there's opportunities across almost every market that we serve today. Jason Seidl : Fair enough. Appreciate the time as always. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Your line is open. Ben Nolan : Yes, thanks. Hey guys. I had a sort of a big picture question. Just given all of the uncertainty with respect to the economy, as you guys have mentioned, if we do move into a little bit more of a challenging environment or a recession, do you think that the railroad is positioned any differently than it had been historically or not? And if so, how would that be? Jim Foote : Big pictures. Everybody looks at me for that -- to answer that question. Well, I guess, by big picture, I mean, from an economy standpoint because I don't know what the next thing they can throw at us that we haven't seen in the last 2.5 years here. So I think the railroads are in CSX and the railroad industry in general is well-positioned right now with everything that's going on in terms of issues associated with congestion, issues associated with highway congestion, issues concerning the environment. More and more and more customers every single day are asking us about what it is we can do for them to help them with their ESG targets. My experience in the railroad business is when you -- if there is a bigger downturn or a downturn in the economy, to the extent that our service gets back to where the reliability we had pre pandemic. We're a great option for companies when they need to reduce their costs, and they need to reduce their transportation spend and people who are making decisions based on, I don't care what it costs to get it there, just get it there. And we're going to pay 25 times the historical average rate to move a container from A to B. What they want to do is save money, that's where our -- that's where we really get to play more in the game because we're always substantially cheaper than a truck. So, everything winds up for us to the -- but it's all based upon our ability given number of employees in here that we need so that we can prove to the customer that we're reliable. As Kevin just said, it's across the board. People that historically always move grain by rail or trucking it. People -- the supply chains are completely disrupted and to -- in some areas, completely dysfunctional. So, things will return to normal. We will get back to where we were, and we'll continue to grow share, principally by competing with and beginning to convert more and more traffic off the highway all the time. Ben Nolan : All right. Appreciate it. Thanks for that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Eric Morgan with Barclays. Your line is open. Eric Morgan : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about capacity of the network outside labor. I think you talked about how much additional capacity has been freed up to PSR. And looking at things now, does that kind of still exist today? Or are there bottlenecks that you think need to be resolved with additional capital once your labor situation is on their footing? Jamie Boychuk : No, Eric, it's purely labors what's -- people is what's holding us back. Our network is -- as if anything, our network has improved over the past three years. As you heard Jim, we put just as much tie rail and ballast and as we have. We've done siding extensions in areas we've invested. And we've got more locomotives than we need. We're really in a great spot if we had the folks that we need to move the business. So, our terminals, as a matter of fact, 90% of our home terminals are running very well. Our flat switching terminals are running well. Where we get congestion a little bit of bottleneck is different crew change points where we don't have crews to keep those trains moving and we got to make a decision on which train moves quicker than a different train. So, very confident that the network is better than probably what it was in 2019 and we're ready to go once we get the folks trained up. Eric Morgan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jordan Alliger : Yes. Just sort of following up a little on the last operational related question. I mean you guys are -- seem to be pretty close or moving closer on the headcount front and the network, you say is in good shape. But -- and it's just a matter of getting those extra employees, but is there anything that needs to be done like reconfiguring schedules? I mean I know you mentioned you're making decisions on which trains to run? I mean is there any wider scale changes either the intermodal network, the carload network needed in addition to the employees? Or is it simply that? And then when you hit that 7,000 target, I mean how quickly does all this volume and service react? I mean it just doesn't seem that we're that far away. I'm just trying to understand how that gap in the service, how it reacts and how quickly to react. Thanks. Jamie Boychuk : Jordan, it's -- where we're sitting right now with respect to our terminals and everything else, we are in much better shape than we have been in a long time. So we design -- we review and analyze the railroad every single day, every single week. As a matter of fact, I made an org change just a month ago or so that service design reports directly to me. So then I can work closer with them so we can continue to design things every day. When I say we make a decision, it's the unscheduled network of coal and grain that has become a much higher priority than it ever has been. And that unscheduled network is where those decisions come in with the crew availability. And of course, Kevin and I and our teams are working all the time to make sure that when there's a location that -- at a shortened rain and needs to feed chickens or anything else, we'll make sure we get it there. It's just on-time service and it never was before. The same thing with coal for the Southern utilities. This was all stockpile and it's turned into just on-time service. So that's changed for us, and it's very difficult for us to schedule unit trains, not knowing when they're going to be released to come out. James Foote : Yes, Jordan, it's Jim, too. We're grinding here every day, and we're doing all of this with hand to mouth and trying to make sure that we serve every customer that we possibly can, the best we can. And yes, our velocity is down, our dwell is up but we still move more carloads in the second quarter of this year than we did in 2019 when we were running lights out. So it's not like, oh my god, what are these guys or velocity is down 21%. Their volumes must be down 21%. We're still moving more freight than we did. So yes, that's why we're confident that when we get volumes back to where we get the velocity back to where they were and things are -- and key from a customer standpoint is reliability. That's why velocity dwell, first mile, last mile, that's why these metrics are so important because this is what the customer looks at to determine whether or not they're going to ship by rail or truck. If we get that back, that's where we have a reasonably solid base to believe that the volumes will grow in the second half and continue to grow into the future. But we're moving more freight this quarter than we did in 2019. Jordan Alliger : Yes. It's interesting on the unit train and just-in-time comment actually. I'm curious though, does that mean that there are issues separate from what you as a rail could do and more related to the customer on this whole just-in-time thing that that may make it a challenge or not? Jim Foote : Well, Kevin might want to weigh in, but as I said, it's everybody in the supply chain when we're talking about moving coal trains from a mine to a utility or from a mine to an export terminal. It's not just the railroad. We need everybody in the supply chain to work, when you're talking about moving international boxes from a port to a warehouse on the south side of Chicago, we need the terminal to work, you need the railroad to work. You need the inland terminal to work, you need to have chassis there. You need to have packers there. You need to have somebody there that can unload the box when it gets to the warehouse and get it off the chassis and can get it back. There are billion moving parts, we play a role in that in many respects. And each one of those key elements in the supply chain is challenged. So we need to get better. Everybody needs to get better. And you get a sense, generally, the things are gradually improving. And again, you see that in every industry, that is not working properly because of the issues associated with the shortage of employees. Jordan Alliger : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much and thanks for taking my question. Jim, I'd like to go big picture on you here. You talked about, okay, if we could just get to 7,000 and get our trains where we need to be, everything comes down quickly, we start running well. And then you said, well, it's not really that simple, right? Because we've got shippers that need to accommodate. We've got ports that need to accommodate. I guess my thought is if you had all the crew you needed tomorrow, or a year from now, right? You pick your target. How long would it take you to get the network running the way you want to run it? And then I guess, on the tail end of that, the worlds changed a lot in the last year. Has your thought about what kind of returns this business can generate changed at all as part of that macro? Jim Foote : Big picture question. Thanks a lot, Jeff, following up with an easy one, soft ball. I might -- no. As I said before, I think the railroad industry is extremely well-positioned, not just for the short-term, for the long-term with everything that's going on in the world, globally, United States, you name it, reshoring, issues associated with this and the other thing, highway congestion, you name it. I think the railroad industry is extremely well-positioned to be a much more relevant and key player in the transportation network and shipment of customers' goods going forward. And so if we're more relevant, if we provide a better service in your -- a key component that should be good for our markets, not bad for our margins. We're in much more sought after product service as opposed to just a transportation commodity. So that is -- so that's good. Can I fix the global hunger? No. Can I solve the pandemic? No. Can I fix CSX and his team, do I have 100% confidence in the people that work for CSX to get this railroad back and running than what it was and then even better? Yes. So, I can't fix the chassis shortage problems. I can't fix -- I can't invest in coal mines. I can't move this. I can't move that. But that will all correct itself over time. And we will be a much bigger participant in that. And like I said, I think we've got a great future ahead of us. Jeff Kauffman : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Corporation Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations. Matthew Korn : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter call. Joining me on today's call are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Foote, our outgoing President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In our earnings presentation, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. And with that, it's my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Joe Hinrichs. Joe Hinrichs : All right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our conference call. I'm excited to be here with you today on my first earnings call as President and CEO of CSX. The entire CSX leadership team is here with me this afternoon, and we appreciate the opportunity to discuss our strong third quarter results with you. Our whole team is very motivated to build on our current momentum, strengthen our key relationships, provide better service to our customers and deliver profitable growth for years to come. We will achieve this through our One CSX culture, which at its core means one team working together to serve all our key stakeholders. As Matthew mentioned, also joining us on tonight's call is Jim Foote, who as you all know, led this company through its remarkable -- remarkably successful transformation over these last five years. Jim cares deeply about this railroad and its employees, and he has already been a great resource during my first several weeks in this role. I'll be happy to have his invaluable advice in the months ahead, and I want to thank him for all the help you have given me personally as I get the privilege to follow him. Jim, on behalf of everyone here at CSX, thank you. Jim Foote : Thanks, Joe. As I have said on every earnings call since I took over as CEO five years ago, I am incredibly proud of every CSX employee who has been by my side as we transformed this organization into the best railroad in North America, a company that's safer, more efficient, more profitable and far more successful than when we started. I have the utmost confidence that Joe and this team will take this organization to even higher levels of success. This transition process has been underway for a long time. It was critically important that the Board and I ensure that a succession plan was in place when the right time came. Having seen CSX through the initial phases of our transformation, pass some unusual, to say the least, challenges. And now with our operating performance starting to get back to normal, it's the right time for me to step away. Joe is a great guy. He is very talented, and he brings a tremendous amount of operations experience in running a large, complicated industrial company. His years working with a diverse unionized workforce will clearly serve him very well. It's truly been an honor to serve as President and CEO of CSX, and I wish all of you and everyone connected to this railroad the best. And now back to Joe. Joe Hinrichs : Thanks, Jim. I promise you this team won't let you down. I am honored to be here on behalf of the entire CSX team. I've spent the last month traveling all across the network, visiting our facilities and meeting with our customers, our employees, union leaders, regulatory partners and government officials. At this point, I can tell you two things for certain. First, this is a fantastic railroad. Our people and our infrastructure are second to none and the principles of scheduled railroading that drive our successful resilient operating model are deeply embedded throughout the company. I knew that CSX was a very impressive place when I started did not appreciate how impressive it really is until I saw for myself how this team of skilled, dedicated men and women work together to move thousands of box cars and containers for our customers each and every day. Second, for as much as this company has achieved over its transformation during the last several years, there is still so much more that CSX can do. Rail is a low-cost freight solution. Rail is a freight solution with low emissions. Manufacturing investment in the United States is accelerating. We have great advantages in this market, and our customers should have every reason to ship more by CSX rail, but we have to focus our efforts to make this happen.  We have to make it easier for our customers to use our service. We have to provide better service to our customers. We have to engage with all of our employees, especially those out in the field serving our customers every day to ensure that we deliver the reliability that we promised.  And we have to challenge ourselves to nurture the kind of culture that fosters a nimble creative and market-leading company, while staying true to the operational discipline that makes this all possible. The concept of one CSX as one team working together to accomplish great things can be very powerful. We have to bring one CSX to life. We'll talk more about that in a few minutes.  But now let's turn to our presentation to review the financial highlights for the third quarter of 2022. CSX moved nearly 1.6 million carloads in the third quarter and generated approximately $3.9 billion in revenue. Operating income increased 10% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, which include the effect of additional labor and fringe expense related to the tentative agreements reached with our unions last month.  Results this quarter also reflected lower real estate gains compared to last year. Earnings per share increased 21% to $0.52 a share. Our operating ratio for the quarter was 59.5%. Now let me turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for the details. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Joe. Turning to Slide 5. Third quarter revenue increased 18% year-over-year with revenue growth across all markets. Overall volumes were up 2% as modest volume growth in merchandise and intermodal more than offset a minor decline in coal. Merchandise revenue increased 14% on 1% higher volumes, driven by pricing that reflects rising cost inflation and higher fuel surcharge revenue. We saw strength in the automotive market, where revenues rose 31% on 13% higher volume. Semiconductor challenges continue to ease and we see significant finished vehicle inventory that needs to move. Ag and food was also a bright spot as improving cycle times, as well as stronger demand for grain, wheat and ethanol and resulted in revenue growth of 25% on 10% higher volume in the quarter. Fertilizers and metals and equipment both saw modest revenue growth despite volume declines in the quarter. Fertilizer shipments continue to be impacted by reduced phosphate shipments and production facility turnarounds. Lower metals and equipment shipments reflect volatile commodity pricing and mill maintenance outages. Intermodal revenue increased 19% on 2% higher volume, as yields remained strong and supported by high fuel prices. International shipments were partially offset by lower domestic volumes, which reflected tight equipment availability and softer truck market. Intermodal demand remained strong in the quarter, with the team continuing to collaborate with customers and identify new opportunities, including a new international service line that contributed to growth. Customers continue to recognize our industry-leading service product in a challenging market, as they seek lower cost and lower emission alternatives to truck. Coal revenue increased 36% on 2% lower volume as pricing continues to benefit from strong export benchmarks. Volumes remain limited in the quarter due to production issues at the mine, infrastructure constraints at the export terminals and general manpower shortages, though our crew availability did show improvement into the end of the quarter. We were also able to reopen portions of our Curtis Bay Terminal in September, which provides additional volume opportunities as operations normalize. Demand remains strong and we see opportunities to move more volume as some of these constraints ease. Trucking revenue increased 26%, mainly due to strong core pricing and higher fuel recovery. Other revenue increased largely due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage fees. The strong sequential increase was driven by continued limited warehouse capacity at customer sites. Looking forward, there is obvious macroeconomic uncertainty as the Fed remains committed to raising rates and addressing high inflation. Given this backdrop, the team is highly focused on its efforts to drive strategic growth opportunities that target truck and expand CSX's addressable market. As you've seen, our select site program continues to facilitate new customer partnerships. Last month, a key emerging domestic lithium supplier for the EV and battery markets announced the construction of a $600 million refining and manufacturing facility on a CSX serve site in Tennessee. We also have several other potential projects in various stages of development. We continue to see customers investing in new projects across our network. We're also moving forward with efforts to facilitate ESG solutions for our customers. Before year end, we will be releasing an updated version of our carbon calculator that is integrated within our ShipCSX interface. This new calculator will enable customers to drive into much deeper detail and understand in real time, the environmental benefits that CSX Rail can provide. Finally, we are also encouraged that service performance is on an upward trend and we expect to turn this positive momentum into additional opportunities with customers. I will now turn it over to Jamie to discuss operations. Jamie Boychuk : Thanks, Kevin. Safety remains our top priority at CSX and operating safely is the foundation to our service restoration efforts. In the third quarter, our personal injury rate and train accident rate decreased sequentially. Though we are not satisfied with our performance, I'm encouraged by our success, especially given the number of new employees across the network. As we mentioned last quarter, it is critically important to instill a culture of safety in our new T&E employees from day one. That emphasis on safety does not end when new employees graduate from training. It requires continuous attention throughout every railroader's career. To reinforce this, we are actively engaging with new hires and all of our employees in the field to discuss recent injuries and accidents, to ensure that we take each opportunity to learn from each other. In the fourth quarter, our efforts will continue to focus on making sure our employees are protected from incidents that commonly occur as weather changes. Increased education and awareness of seasonal safety risks will help our team become safer. Turning to slide 7, we are encouraged by the recent improvement in our operational performance. These strong results are a testament to the one CSX team and their unrelenting devotion to serving our customers. If we only look at the third quarter averages, train velocity, the well and carload trip plan performance all showed the deterioration versus the prior year, though intermodal trip plan compliance continue to improve 240 basis points. However, on the right side of each chart of this slide, shows the substantial improvements we have made throughout the quarter and continue into recent weeks. As shown here, in the most recent four week performance, all of these four key operational measures are above the averages for the third quarter 2022. But they're also ahead of third quarter 2021 performance. We are confident that these metrics show that our efforts to hire, train and retain new employees are starting to take hold and make a difference for our customers. Though we are encouraged by the operational momentum, we will not let up. We will continue to push forward and take actions necessary until service is fully restored to a level that our customers expect. We are promoting new conductors, allocating the appropriate number of assets and improving the overall reliability and operational resilience of our network. Turning to slide 8, in the third quarter, active T&E headcount reached the highest level since March 2020. Though the quarterly average shows a sequential increase of less than 100 employees, we exited the quarter with over 6,800, total. The hiring pipeline remains robust. And we averaged over 500 trainees again in the third quarter. We are determined to keep the pipeline full, allowing us to continue filling classes as we work towards our goal of 7,000 active T&E employees by year-end. Currently, we have over 700 employees in training and have additionally started locomotive engineer training. The number of conductors that finished training and marked up was down slightly in the third quarter as we cycled lower class sizes from earlier in the year. We anticipate this number to increase in the fourth quarter, as the class sizes have remained elevated through the late spring and summer months. Conductor promotions will continue to increase the active T&E headcount. Our efforts to minimize attrition that we highlighted in the last quarter are bearing fruit. We hire attrition in the preceding months have trended lower, and we believe our hiring initiatives and recent pay agreements for new conductors are a contributing factor. I will now hand it over to Sean to review the financial results. Sean Pelkey : Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon. The favorable operating momentum, Jamie discussed was accompanied by strong revenue growth of 18% or $600 million, including gains across all markets. Operating income was up 10% to $1.6 billion as top line gains outpaced expense headwinds from higher fuel costs, inflation, and tentative union agreement impacts that I will discuss in more detail on the next slide. The operating ratio was 59.5%, which, as a reminder, includes roughly a 250 basis point ongoing impact from quality carriers. Interest and other expense was roughly flat as was income tax expense. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.9%, lower than our statutory rate as a result of a favorable state legislative change. As such, net earnings of $1.1 billion, was up 15%, with EPS up 21%. Now, let's take a closer look at expense on the next slide. Total third quarter expense increased $460 million versus the prior year. Fuel was up nearly $200 million, primarily due to higher prices. Inflation remains above historical levels with $82 million of inflation across labor PS&L [ph] and rents. Labor inflation alone was around $50 million, which reflects the proposed wage rate increase from the tentative union agreements. In addition, we recorded $42 million of out-of-period expenses related to adjusting union labor accruals for the tentative agreements. The most significant piece of this is the impact of the proposed union bonuses. When you think about labor expense going forward, the $42 million is a net catch-up and will not recur. The base labor per employee, excluding this impact is expected to be the new run rate for Q4 and into the first half of next year. Of course, comp per employee will also be impacted by seasonality mix and other factors, but the full impact of the tentative union agreement is now in our base labor costs. Next, Quality and Pan Am combined for $46 million of higher expense with the increase split about evenly between the two. Quality expenses correlate with higher revenues, while Pan Am reflects the first full quarter of CSX ownership. The Pan Am integration process is well underway, and we continue to receive positive customer indications around strong growth opportunities as we invest to increase the speed and reliability of the former Pan Am network. Real estate gains were $33 million less than prior year, with volume and all other expenses increasing $66 million. While operating fluidity improved through the quarter, our hiring focus remains, and we incurred approximately $40 million of incremental costs related to T&E training, higher locomotive count, additional intermodal terminal activity and other congestion-related items. Volume-related costs and higher depreciation represented the balance of the expense increase. We do expect some of the congestion related expenses to continue into the fourth quarter, but view these costs as the first efficiency opportunities to be realized as we achieved sustained improvements in network performance. Now, turning to cash flow on slide 11. Year-to-date, free cash flow before dividends is down nearly $30 million, but up approximately $120 million, when adjusting for after-tax cash proceeds from the Virginia transaction. This is despite close to $225 million of additional capital spend, as we continue investing for the health of our network to support the quality in Pan Am acquisitions and position for future growth. After funding all the capital needs of the business, shareholder distributions have exceeded $4.3 billion this year, including over $3.7 billion of share repurchases and nearly $650 million of dividends. Additionally, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, including $2.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. Looking forward, we expect to maintain our balanced opportunistic approach to returning excess cash to shareholders. And with that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. Joe Hinrichs : All right. Thank you, Sean. Now let's conclude with a review of our outlook as shown on slide 12. There is no change to our expectation for double-digit revenue and operating growth for the full year, excluding the effects of the Virginia real estate transaction. While there is uncertainty in the global economy, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on this guidance as we look over the remainder of this year. As we mentioned in our earlier remarks, we are pleased with the positive momentum in our service metrics. And we continue our hiring and training efforts to ensure that we have the resources needed to build on these trends and drive improved network fluidity. We remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders, as you saw over this past quarter. And finally, we reiterate our priority to building a unified cohesive culture of ONE CSX that will strengthen the relationships we have with our employees, customers and all other stakeholders. This is a great company. And working together, there is so much more that we can accomplish. And that's why I'm so excited to be here. Thank you all. I'll now turn it back to Matthew for Q&A. Matthew Korn : Thank you, Joe. Now in the interest of time, I\u2019d ask that everyone, please limit yourselves to only one question. And with that, operator, please open up the line. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ken Hoexter : Can you talk a little bit about your learning curve, why your right background for the role, what you hope to accomplish? And I mean it's a general question. And then, I mean my more specific one would be on trucking, right? Like you talked about the rate ramp? And is that something that gets impacted by loose capacity, or is the chemical business just different from the trucking side? But I'll stick with the big on -- for you, Joe, to start with. Joe Hinrichs : Okay. Thanks, Ken. Well, I think Jim highlighted a couple of things, but certainly, the labor side of the business experience in the automotive industry is certainly very applicable to our situation that we're in now, when you look at working through -- with our labor union partners, tenant agreements and ratification and working through those issues. But more importantly, I had the opportunity to be a customer for 20 years of the rail industry and have shared a lot of those experiences with our team and have challenged us to continue to look at things from a customer perspective to make sure that we are holding ourselves to a higher standard of service and accountability for our side of this relationship. And I'm really proud of the work that Jamie and the operations team are doing to really show improvement in that area. Jim mentioned that obviously, the auto industry is a complex business. And so is the rail industry, there's different types of complexities. But from my background experience, I think a lot of that's applicable. But I would step back for a second and say, at the end of the day, it's the workforce, it's the people here that serve our customers. And when we bring everybody together and align around our core objectives and around our opportunity to serve our customers better and work together better, we can create an even better CSX, and that's an opportunity for us to bring home and to bring to life and really excited to be a part of that. I'll let Kevin handle the second part. Kevin Boone : If I got your question right, on the chemical, you're asking about the chemical trucking quality and. Ken Hoexter : Yes. Kevin, I guess, just obviously, what we're seeing in the market is just how pricing collapsing right on the spot basis. And I just want to understand, is the chemical business different in terms of the revenues we can expect from the trucking and other business, or is that something that's maybe more sustainable? Kevin Boone : Yes. I mean you have to remember when we were looking at this business, it's a high touch customers really care about product quality and the brand awareness that they have for quality is very, very high. This is not a business that are typically moves around. And so what you've seen is actually, they've done a great job of attracting some drivers this year. And so that's been -- I think they've done an excellent job versus the market there. And then Pricing has been very, very good and continues to remain that way. And so that's what we continue to see. It's a very, very different market. It's not -- people have to be highly trained, highly skilled to do that business, and they have a great workforce doing it. Ken Hoexter : Great. Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Kevin Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Group : Hi, Thanks, afternoon, guys. Sean, maybe just any near-term color guidance on the other revenue, the labor comp per employee, anything on operating ratio in Q4. And then, Joe, just it sounds like more of a focus on service culture, so maybe, I guess, more of a growth focus. I guess how are you thinking about the ability to grow and improve operating ratio over time, or is it more just about growth, or is it both? Just your big picture strategy going forward. Sean Pelkey : Scott, I'll start with the sort of modeling questions. In terms of other revenue, what we've said for a while here is that we do expect it to normalize as supply chains get back to normal. Clearly, that didn't happen here in the third quarter with the increase that we saw in the other revenue line. But the expectation remains the same that we should see it come down in the fourth quarter and again into next year. To your other point around comp per employee. I think the best way to think about that is to take the $42 million we talked about, which was the out-of-period expenses related to the tentative Union agreement, strip that out of labor -- and that's the employee run rate that you're probably going to want to use going into Q4 as well as into the first half of next year before the next increase takes place in July of 2023. I'll let Joe take the second part of the question. Joe Hinrichs : Thanks, Sean. And thanks, Scott. I think the way I'd like to describe it really is just on how we're looking at this is just to step back for a second I had the opportunity throughout the summer with all my conversations with Jim and the Board to really take -- to get educated on tailor railroading and get educated on CSX. So the way I like to describe is how we're looking at things is the five guiding principles of scale in are really around improved safety, improved customer service, control costs, improve your asset utilization and engage and then ultimately, value and evolve your employees. And so if you take a look at all five of those things, they're all very important. And so operating ratio is a big part of looking at controlling costs and your asset utilization and frankly, a number of other pieces that go in there. So clearly, that's a very important number for us and a very important part of our objectives. Improving safety, as Jamie talked about earlier, is really important and we'll never ever get away from that in this industry. The other two areas around our customers and employees are opportunities for us. So how do we leverage our strong operating model that we have here that Jim and the team have built over a number of years to continue to improve the service we provide our customers and the experience and the engagement our employees feel as part of one CSX team. Now how does that lead to growth?  I'll tell you a couple of ways. One, with the increased service performance and the manpower that we're putting on that increases our capacity, which we now can leverage to quickly provide for our customers. I've had the opportunity to reach out and have video calls with about eight of our largest customers over the last couple of weeks and almost every single one of them has told me directly to our CEO or COO of all those customers, they've all told me that when you deliver a better service and more reliable, predictable service, we want to do more business with you.  So, we'll have to chase growth by trying to do unnatural things. We need to continue to do the things we're doing, leverage our operating model to continue to deliver better service and with that increase the headcount and with that comes the opportunity to serve our customers better. And because we're a lower cost, because we're better for the environment because of all kinds of other reasons, there's opportunities for us to grow the business that way. And that's the way we look at the opportunity through better customer service through increased capacity through the manning, we have the opportunity to serve our customers and there's more opportunity for us there. Scott Group : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Ben Nolan : Thanks. I appreciate the time guys. I wanted to get back to the coal side of it a little bit. Those outages have kind of continued both at the mines and the ports and appreciating that we're sort of now getting back to normal. Given the demand that you're seeing from your customers, is it possible to give any color as to how much incremental volume is achievable, let's say, in the next six months or however long it takes for some of these bottlenecks to normalize? How much better is it than it used to be or than it currently is, do you think. Kevin Boone : Yes. I think probably the gating factor as we get into next year, and we obviously are confident in resolving our labor issues as what can the producers actually produce. Coal mines are \u2013 have been undercapitalized, quite frankly, and now have a lot of money in there looking for equipment, reinvesting. And so, I anticipate it will get better. We also do have a mine coming online middle of next year that will help us and we have a number of them that are still ramping up.  So. production looks like it could be up next year, knock on wood. We probably would have said that last year at this time, too. So -- there's a lot of things that can happen as you \u2013 we mentioned previously on the call, we've had some mines that have struggled, but are coming out of that here recently into the fourth quarter. So optimistic on the production side. There's clearly a need when you look at the utility coal mines are the utilities that we serve, particularly in the South. They have a lot of inventories; they need to replenish and so we anticipate a lot more consistent deliveries over the next year to really replenish those levels and we continue to see the export market very, very strong and a lot of geopolitical risk out there in Europe and other areas where you probably didn't see as much demand a year ago, continue to have a lot of demand. So mind you want to serve that, it's profitable for them, and we anticipate to have the resources to be able to deliver going into next year. Q \u2013 Ben Nolan : Okay. I appreciate it. Is that sort of if you're just categorizing areas of the business, that's probably the one area that we're looking into next year, there's the best growth potential? How do you think of it that way? A \u2013 Kevin Boone : I think on the volume side, remember, we kind of moved with the commodity price on the international market. So depending on what that does, they're at very, very healthy levels today. A little bit down from the highs that we saw previously in the year, but that I think that will be the biggest factor as we look at overall coal revenue for the next year. Q \u2013 Ben Nolan : All right. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Hi, everyone. Joe, hearty congratulations to you. I wish you the best, and Jim will miss you. I'm sure you'll miss all the 50 conferences and all the questions that we ask you, but hopefully, you'll find something else to do. So congratulations to both of you all. Sean, I wanted to ask you about the cost structure ex-fuel. Obviously, the fourth quarter -- but I'm really kind of interested in how you think about it for 2023, because that we're obviously still in a pretty high inflationary environment. And just related to that, Kevin, once Sean talks about that, can you just talk about your confidence in being able to grow the franchise enough to actually see earnings growth and EBIT growth next year relative to 2022. Just what your level of confidence is in given some of these idiosyncratic volume factors netted out against obviously some uncertainty on the macro side? A \u2013 Sean Pelkey : Thanks, Amit. I'll get started on the cost question. So I mean, think about the fact that the labor cost has now been reset. So we know what our base is kind of going into next year. Inflation doesn't show any signs of abating here more broadly outside of labor and recognize that some of our costs are based on lagging indicators, meaning they'll get set based on where the inflationary rates are in 2022 for next year. So there's no doubt we'll be in a sustained inflationary environment going into next year between labor and some of those outside party contracts that we have. That being said, we've been carrying extra costs here throughout the year as the network has not operated the way we would have wanted it to based on not having enough proves in the right places. That problem is rapidly getting fixed here. You can see it in the numbers over the last couple of weeks. And so some of those costs are probably going to be a bit sticky going into the fourth quarter. But as we get into next year, I think there's plenty of opportunity for us to drive some efficiencies and take some of the cost out to help offset the inflationary headwinds that we're going to see. A \u2013 Kevin Boone : Yeah. My confidence level, I'll tell you where my confidence level is. I'm confident in what the team is doing and what we're going to be able to control going into next year. And there's a number of factors, obviously, that are out of our control, but we have a tremendous amount of initiatives that are really taking hold and are really going to capitalize on the service product that we expect to deliver next year. As Joe mentioned, there's a lot of customers that I want to give us more share what they're producing and what they're making out there. And so we have a lot of those initiatives in place that will reap benefits as we move into next year. And that's where my confidence lies. We started the process very, very early in terms of looking at those, realizing that there could be different markets that can move around on us next year. But we know through them -- what's happened during the pandemic is the railroad, in particular, all of us really haven't participated in the growth that existed out there. And so that's our objective to position ourselves no matter what the economy holds that we're taking our fair share and then more of it. And so that's where the confidence is very, very high across the whole team. And we were just with our short-line partners. And I think there's a lot of confidence there that they have opportunities to go out into the market and take share from truck. Amit Mehrotra : Yes. That makes sense. And Sean, I just wanted to follow-up just one quick point on what you said. So if I look at your cost base ex-fuel this year, it's kind of like $7.3 billion. It seems like 4%, 5% inflation off that number is kind of the right structural costs that go up. But, I guess, what you're saying is, listen, there's a lot of inefficiency $40 million a quarter in 2022. So maybe there's an opportunity to actually, if the fluidity gets better, is actually an opportunity to see net inflation lower than that. Is that -- would you say that's a fair characterization? Sean Pelkey : Well, I mean, we're going to see how much cost we can take out based on how well the network spends. But I think the general premise that you're thinking about is the right construct, we got $40 million to $50 million a quarter this year that as we cycle better, should go away. Is there more opportunity beyond that? Sure. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good afternoon. Jamie, I think last quarter, I asked you about capacity as you're still trying to ramp up the labor force. Now it feels like you're pretty close to rightsizing the network from a labor perspective. We've talked a little bit about some of those excess equipment you have on the network today, what would you estimate the spare capacity is today on the network to take on new business, meet this demand that you've been leaving on the table for much of the last 12 months. And, I guess, the other way to phrase it, too, is if we do go into a pretty deep downturn, is that capacity that you'd be willing to kind of flex off the network for a short period of time, or it's something you want to keep to make sure you're never short, again, given some of the labor issues? Jamie Boychuk : Thanks for the question, Jon. When we take a look at the capacity that we currently have out there right now, it's all about people, people, people. And we've been saying this quarter after quarter after quarter. And you're right, we are getting closer to our targets, but we're still a few hundred people off. So we have pinch points out there that isn't as flu as we want. You can see in our numbers that we're starting to -- the velocity is picking up or dwells coming down. Even our trip plan performance is creeping up, but definitely not where we want it to be. So over the next couple of quarters, really, you're going to start to see that momentum continue to pick up. And as Sean mentioned, yes, we still have too many locomotives out there. And the velocity will help us on that end. And even our cars online are higher than where they should be. So as we continue to move forward, there is a lot of cost opportunity there for us to pull out. But -- and as we do that and as we move quicker, easily I mean, we've said this years ago, but there's easily the capacity that's out there with the right manpower, we've always said 10%, 15%, 20% capacity with the way that this plant is set up isn't really that big of an issue as long as we have the people to move it. We've got all the assets we need and we are blessed with a fantastic network here at CSX with double track, long sidings and some good yards that can handle a lot. And an operating team out there that's just doing fantastic. So they've proven to us time and time again, that we have that capacity to continue to grow. So this is still a people story for us as we move forward. Now, when we talk about that, and as you mentioned, I mean, that pent-up demand has been discussed a number of times from Kevin and other folks, what is that pent-up demand that's out there? Is that 4%? Is that 5%? Is it 10%? I mean a port number -- a different number of what that really can be out there. So, if we see a dip in the economy, we expect to be able to start picking up some of that freight that we can't pick up today. And for us, we just need to have a -- stay with the forward-looking view on what's going to happen in not just next month or two months from now. But we want to look at nine months from now, 10 months from now and really protect that TV head count that we have. And if we get into any type of situation where we needed to do something different, there's natural attrition. Our natural attrition is 8% to 10% each year. And if we needed to pause classes, we're able to do that. But ultimately, we want to protect that T&E workforce that's there. As we just mentioned, Sean mentioned and I did, I guess at the start of the question, there's a lot of other levers we can pull throughout the organization. So as a team, I think we would all sit down and have that discussion and we will make sure that we rightsize our assets and railroads are always heavy on assets. So we've got a lot of great cost savings we can do on that end. But all in all, we want to protect that T&E workforce and forward-looking. And as -- if some type of a softening in the market comes, we're going to be prepared come out of it strong. We'll be prepared to get all the traffic that's out there, and we're going to come out of this stronger than we ever have if we get into that situation. Jon Chappell : That\u2019s great detail. Thanks so much Jamie. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is open. Tom Wadewitz : Great. Good afternoon. Wanted to see if you could offer maybe a quick thought on operating ratio in fourth quarter versus third quarter. Another railroad reported earlier today, Union Pacific and I think, surprised people a bit with talking about worse to normal seasonal OR in 4Q versus 3Q. So I wanted to see if you could offer a quick thought on that. And then for Kevin, I think in a higher inflation environment, you'd like to get more price, but the counterpoint to that is that the truck market is weaker and you do compete with truck. So how do you think about those factors? Can you get more priced because you have more inflation, or should we be mindful of lower truckload pricing and that's kind of a barrier to getting more price. Thank you. Sean Pelkey : Tommy, I'll start on the Q4 OR question. So, I think typical seasonality, it's not always this way, but usually, it's a little bit worse from Q3 to Q4, and that's primarily because we start to wrap up some of our capital projects, and we've got some winter-related expenses that hit. So, all reason to believe that, that same dynamic would occur this year. Some of the other things that will impact the operating ratio going from Q3 to Q4, fuel was a benefit here in the third quarter because of the positive lag that we had. If fuel prices stay relatively constant or follow the forward curve, we would expect that fuel is going to be a bit of a sequential headwind to the OR. It could be 100 basis points or more based on where the forward curve is right now. So that's just a little bit of noise. Beyond that, hopefully, we're able to pick up some volume as the network starts spinning, take some costs out. So those are good things. And then I think it's a matter of what do we see on the intermodal storage side because that can be a bit of a swing factor for us as we sit right now. Kevin Boone : Hey Tom, on the trucking environment and other things, I think what you have to remember is we don't really operate in the spot market when the truckers are getting 30%, 40% rate increases, that's not what was occurring on our end, and we have a lot of long-term agreements with customers that they understand. And the good news right now, we're seeing our customers get price, and they understand some of the cost pressures we're facing. And so we're having those constructive conversations with them. And I think the spreads maybe versus truck aren't as great as they were before, but you have fuel surcharge, which is very high right now, and we know that flows through the truck rates. And so there's still a very, very compelling value proposition for customers to shift from rail -- from truck to rail. And so, we're still leaning into that, and there's a lot of appetite that we continue to hear of companies wanting to do that and for the environmental reasons as well. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. So it sounds like you're not overly concerned about the kind of maybe falling truckload contract rates, you're still pretty optimistic on price? Kevin Boone : Yeah. That was participating in the 30%, 40% rate increases, maybe that would be more of a risk, but that wasn't the reality of our business model. Tom Wadewitz : Make sense. Okay. Thanks for the perspective. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So, maybe a quick labor follow-up first for Sean, looking at taking out that $42 million, as you mentioned, getting around $33,000 per employee. I don't know, so it's not a huge step up really from a year-over-year perspective from what you reported. So, if you can help decipher that a little bit, something I'm missing, maybe there's been some incentive comp or maybe mix with Pan Am now in the first full quarter. So any thoughts on that would be helpful as we take that and run forward with it? And then just maybe a quick one for Jamie as well. When you think about the service recovery and you're performing, I think, best against some of the STB targets that we see in track. How long does it -- you mentioned the pent-up demand, like are you seeing that come back? Are shippers still worried about a potential second slowdown or potential shutdown with the union agreement still not completely in hand? So, what do you think about the near term, and how long does it really take for you to benefit from some of those service gains? Thank you. Sean Pelkey : So on your comp per employee question, yeah, the math is right, and it really is just the inflationary impact over and above the settlement. So, I get to right around $2,000 per employee for that -- for the $50 million, a little bit more than that. The small mix impact from having more drivers at quality, which is a little bit lower comp per employee than a railroad worker, but that's really the only offset. Jamie Boychuk : You can already see our gains in service with the headcount that we've seen rise. So, as we continue to qualify 20, 30, sometimes -- some of the weeks coming up here, 40 employees a week, you should continue to see that trend move forward. Now we've got winter coming. So winter always throws a few challenges at us when we look at our service metrics. But our customers are feeling better now. I can tell you that are from where we need to be. And we're feeling it out in the field the discussions that we have -- Joe and I have spent a lot of time out in the field over the last few weeks and the discussion points our men and women who are making this happen each and every day, whether it's on the ground or in the towers on the service side delivering, everyone is feeling it. We're starting to feel the railroad run better, we're starting to feel the numbers of the cars moving faster. So that's the big highlight that we're excited about and confident that we're going to continue to move forward on these metrics. And look I don't like to comment on any anything that's helped for ratification. I think it's important that we allow our union leaders to have those discussions with the employees that are out there and then any other ongoing discussions and negotiations. We prefer to really not make any comments on that and allow the folks who are working on that to just continue doing what they're doing. Brian Ossenbeck : Understood. Sean, was there any incentive comp impact in this quarter like there was last quarter? Sean Pelkey : No. Brian Ossenbeck : Thanks for time. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Chris Wetherbee : Yes, thanks good afternoon. I guess I think there's been a perception that the demand level that's out there is decently been above what the service has allowed you guys to carry? And I guess \u2013 as you think about some of the macro crosscurrents out there, potential headwinds, is that still the case? Do you think that demand is still maybe meaningfully above what you're able to provide from a service perspective? And I guess, as you think out maybe shorter term, 4Q in particular, should we start to see the weekly carloads begin to ramp up as the service improvement become sort of more realized in the numbers? Just want to get a sense of kind of how you guys are thinking about that? And then maybe a second point, but related is if we do see things get a little bit worse, how quickly do you think you can respond in terms of heads, whether it be your willingness to furlough or just using attrition Jamie, I think you talked about a pretty heavy attrition number. Is that something that you guys would be able to use relatively quickly in response to slowing demand? Kevin Boone : Why don't I touch on the first one, and maybe I'll hand it off to Jamie on the second part of that. Look, I think you're well aware, our network more than well over half of our business such as another network out there, another railroad. And so, it's important for the industry to work together to capture some of these opportunities we continue to talk about.  Clearly, there's a market like housing that are seeing slower signals. But there's other areas like coal and some of the ag products that we're seeing great signs there. And even if in some markets where there could be some slowdown, I think the magnitude of the slowdown is what would be a question for us because there's demand that we haven't been able to meet.  And quite frankly, a lot of our customers haven't been able to meet because of some of their labor issues, the demand that they see out there. So, it's just not all CSX. It's the whole supply chain catching up and we're one part of that. So, we're demand ultimately settles out, I think, is somewhat of a question, but we do see from a share perspective, and that's an important thing, a lot of opportunity to win wallet share with existing customers and we see a lot of new customers willing for maybe the first time coming to us and saying, well, how does rail work and how could we provide a service for us. And those are the things that we have to lean into as we go in and we have some uncertainty in the market, and I'll hand it over to Jamie. Jamie Boychuk : Well, when I -- looking at the question, kind of as I answered it earlier, we got to stay forward looking. Can we pull costs out quick? Well, absolutely, we can. I mean, our locomotives, when you think about that, that's a daily cost. You put it down tomorrow, you stop paying for it tomorrow. I mean these are assets that have been around a long time. And we haven't bought a new locomotive in many years, even though we have a rebuild program other than depreciation, the heaviest cost of a locomotive is which you use every day on them. So, I mean, that is one example of costs that we can handle. And on our T&E side, it's important that we continue to build our T&E workforce where we need it to be. And if we get into a position where things get deeper or things look differently, that attrition, as you mentioned, Chris, it is a heavy attrition rate, and we're able to use that as just a natural way to control our numbers. And by pausing classes, if we get to that, those numbers will take care of themselves. But we -- on the T&E side, and I'm going to keep emphasizing that, we -- it's a very important position like any other in the company, but it takes four months to six months to make a train conductor. And if we get softening market and we come out of this, we are going to be prepared to handle all the traffic that comes back at us and that's a commitment that we're making, and we're going to continue to follow through on that. So all those other levers, there's a lot we can pull in this industry. We want to make sure that we're prepared to come out of any softening if we get to that point. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is open. Justin Long : Thanks. Good afternoon. Sean, are there any thoughts that you can share on your expectation for total volumes and coal RPU moving into the fourth quarter? And then, Joe, congrats on the new role. Congrats to Jim as well. Going back to the question on growth versus margins, I think, it's clear you're focused on improving service, improving the customer experience. Do you think that requires additional costs and a need for margins to take a step back in 2023 to set the stage for future growth, or do you think there's enough cost opportunity from running a more fluid network so that margins can improve next year? Kevin Boone : I guess, I'll take the coal one. I think you could expect -- we're hopeful that some volume step up given the network starting to get more fluidity and some of our producers starting to perform a little bit better. So at the margin, maybe a little bit of better to the benchmark prices. So those have come down. They're still very, very healthy, but that would also impact what we would see in the fourth quarter from an export coal RPU perspective. So a little bit down probably sequentially there, given that we're already a little bit into the quarter and those numbers are down from third quarter. Joe Hinrichs : Yes. Thanks. So this is Joe again. From my perspective, first of all be very clear, our goal is to leverage our strong operating model and our operating ratios to give ourselves some more capacity, to give that incremental volume opportunity that should be very complementary to our margin performance. So we should not have to chase share by degrading our margin. In fact, that would not be wise. It takes a lot of volume to make up for a point of margin. So to be clear, we're really focused, as you've heard over and over tonight about the opportunity to keep this momentum going and leverage our great operating model the team has put in place here to free up that capacity with the manpower to then allow for us to naturally provide more volume to our customers that they're asking for. And that's really what our focus is for the growth side. Q \u2013 Justin Long : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Ari Rosa : Hey, good afternoon. So Joe, I wanted to stick on this question of your background and your experience. But maybe you could talk about what are the learnings that you take from dealing with labor unions in the auto industry that you think carryover to railroads. And then from a customer standpoint, maybe you could give a little more color on what you've shared with your new teammates at CSX about what the customer experience is like from a customer standpoint? And maybe what was being missed internally or if there was anything that was being kind of misunderstood internally about what that experience is like? Thanks. A \u2013 Kevin Boone : Yeah, thanks. So on the labor front, I really applaud Jim, over the last couple of quarters have spoken very openly about the need and the desire of this industry to have a better relationship with its union partners. It's a complex relationship. There are 12 different unions and there's industry bargaining. So those things are a little bit different than the auto industry. But at the core, I believe that if you can develop relationships and spend the time listening to each other, you can get into interest-based bargaining which this team has some success doing here at CSX to find solutions that are in the best interest on both parties and can find win-win solutions. So we were able to do that. It took time, maybe decades to get there in the auto industry, but certainly, I was fortunate to be a part of that. And it won't take us that long here because we're already -- we've already experienced what we experienced lately. And I think we all recognize if we keep doing the same thing, we're going to end up in the same place in a couple of years, and I don't think any of us want that to happen. So big opportunity there and really leaning into that. I've already met with some of our key union leaders. And Jamie mentioned we've been out in the field talking to employees. We've been talking to union leaders here and out in the field and really just want to start building that relationship so we can form opportunity to work together to find solutions that are in the best interest of our employees. If we put our employees first because they're the ones serving our customers every day, I believe we can mutually find areas of opportunity to make progress together. And so on the customer side, challenging our team, especially Steve was coming on the technology side and all of us here to think about what would it take to be able to provide the type of service our customers should expect from us in 2022 and beyond in terms of not only living up to our commitment around the trip plan compliance or having cars ready or those kind of things, but also around visibility, around transparency and communication because some of the frustrations that we experienced on the other side of this was really around transparency and visibility, and there's lots of opportunity for us to get better as an industry and frankly, as a company in that regard. And just really go back to core principles of why we're here. We're in business to serve customers. And so they pay us to -- and they always pay us to honor our commitment and we need to do a better job of honoring that commitment. And you've heard Jamie talk about that a lot. You've heard Kevin reference it. And this team is really committed to delivering to our customers in a better way. And CSX was able to show significant improvement really right before the pandemic. This place was showing dramatic improvement in those kind of metrics and then, of course, got little sidewall that's going to happen with COVID. We want to get back to there. As Jamie said, that's our base camp. We want to get back to there and then we want to -- we expect ourselves to go further from there. So it's really just keeping the employees and the customers at the forefront of everything we do, because they're mutually exclusive on how they work together. If our employees are engaged and feeling good about the culture and about how they're working together, we can deliver we can deliver better service to our customers, obviously, help with less attrition and attracting more people and all that stuff reinforces itself. Thanks. Ari Rosa : Okay, wonderful. Thanks for the thoughts. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open. Brandon Oglenski : Hey. Good evening, everyone and thanks for the question. Jim, I don't know if you're still on, but congrats on retirement. And you want to comment on what you found the most successful the last five years and what was left unturned, I think we'd all appreciate it. And Joe, welcome to railroading. And I guess to your answer on that last question, how do you see the ONE CSX culture fitting into that customer relationship and focusing on the right priorities? Jim Foote : Well, sure. I've just taken a little nap here. That's okay. The biggest success is what you're listening to today in this room. Five years ago, there wasn't an executive team, it was me. These guys are all in new roles, all doing a phenomenal, phenomenal job. I said and oftentimes everybody our owners agree is the best railroad tenor. This is the best management team in the railroad business, and it's the thing that puts a big smile on my face, especially today when I'm getting out of here. Joe Hinrichs : Thanks, Jim, and I thank you from the above of my heart, because I'm equally excited about the team we have here, and I'm blessed to be able to work with everyone that you put together, and it is a great team. On your question on ONE CSX, the initiative -- the culture initiative was rolled out before I got here by the team, which I really appreciate the attention and the focus on that. At the end of the day, if we're going to make more progress as in rail industry and then here at CSX, we have to have a better relationship with our union partners and with our workforce out in the field doing the work that creates the value for our customers every day. So really focusing our energy on CSX about being -- recognizing we're all part of one team. We're all valuable. We should all be appreciated, and we should all be respected and really getting our team to recognize that if we're here to serve and make -- and help make our employees in the field more successful, that ultimately, the company and our customers will be more successful, and really channeling that energy in that way. We have a great operating model. We have a great process. We have great people. And if we can get people working better together, solving problems, helping us deliver better for our customers, I believe, and I think our team -- I know our team believes that we can have a better railroad and better performance overall on aspects of our business. So that's the real impetus around ONE CSX is bringing our team together, after all we've been through with the transformation of the operating model and COVID and labor negotiations and all these things to build from where we are and say, we're going to be one team working together, supporting each other, appreciating each other and delivering for our customers. And ultimately, that will deliver better performance financially for our business and for our shareholders. And it really starts internally -- if we're going to provide better service, we have to really engage with our employees to make that happen. Brandon Oglenski : Thanks for the response. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO. Your line is open. Fadi Chamoun : Thank you. Congratulations to both Jim and Joe on the role and the retirement. I want to ask a question about kind of seeing that's going on kind of all night on this call. I think there is, I believe agreement generally that rails can grow share across many markets because of cost, environmental benefits and so on.  But I think the issue has been in what we hear all way from shippers is not just the level of service, but the consistency of service over seasons over cycle. And I'm not sure coming out of this pandemic and some of these labor issues we've experienced in the last year was a approach that kind of different framework for the operation and kind of capacity going forward.  Is there kind of framework where you look at search capacity, maybe differently than you have in the past, or is there an opportunity maybe on labor agreement to change how availability of cruise is managed through those kind of times to kind of remove some of that volatility that we see in service, which I think has been probably a big hindrance to the growth in the past. Jamie Boychuk : Well, I'll take this one, Fadi. I believe from \u2013 no. We're coming out of this stronger than we ever have and we're coming out of this learning lessons, okay? If we haven't learned lessons along the way, as an industry, it's not just CSX than we haven't been watching or listening to our customers and seeing what's going on out there.  So yes, is there opportunities with their union agreements, there absolutely is. Let's get past the ratification now before you get any comments. But as Joe mentioned, the relationships between our unions and as we continue to do things differently and improve those relationships, it's going to open up opportunity for us to retain employees like we haven't been able to before. And provide possibly a schedule and Jim has talked about this a number of times, provide a better schedule for our employees. So when they come to work, they come to work with a smile on their face. They come to work rested, they come to work being that facing the face that delivers cars to our customers to the docs and they have a positive attitude and they're wanting to grow this company.  And believe me, our employees want us to grow. There is no question about it. They want us to give them the tools to grow and they want us to give them the opportunity to do that. So that's a big opportunity as we move forward. We are staffing up. We are staffing up to make sure that we can handle the demand that Kevin and his team brings forward to the operating team.  Kevin and I talk every single day. Weekly, we go through numbers together. Our teams are very close. We know where the opportunities are out there. A number of great announcements that have been made through Kevin and his team through some big wins on customers who are opening up facilities on us.  So going forward, over the next couple of years, those are great opportunities and we're going to make sure we're staffed up for that. We've got locomotives in storage. I've said that a number of times. I think when I took Joe into Waycross, he saw the number of locomotives we had in storage out there, it's a surprise. I like to call that the field of dreams and one day, maybe we'll have all those locomotives pulling freight and pulling tonnage out there. And if we get to that point, we know that we've really grown this company beyond where we think we can. So we are continuing to prep ourselves to move great, I think I answered the question on what happens if there's a bit of a downturn in business, we're going to stay forward-looking and we're going to try to drive this opportunity like it's never been done before.  And if there is a softening, we're going to make sure that we are fully prepared no matter how it comes to provide that service to the customers like they've never seen before. And that's our goal. And you're right, that's the theme you've heard tonight. And I'm happy that you said that, that is a theme you've heard, because I believe all my colleagues and everyone around the -- the table here, we all believe the same thing. Fadi Chamoun : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ravi Shankar : Thank you. Good evening, everyone. A couple of quick ones. Joe, probably the last one, hopefully you'll have to do is still wearing your auto hat on, but can you just help share with us what do you think the future of auto as an end market is for the railroads, i.e., near-shoring production basis, when do you think the chip shortage eases, et cetera, et cetera, and kind of, how that industry, kind of, ramps up in the near-term and long-term? And as a follow-up, any commentary on I think the rails rejected BMW, kind of, asks in the labor contract and then like summer cycling these increases like your strike, kind of how does that eventually end up? Thank you. Joe Hinrichs : Okay. Thanks. I'll take the second one first, and then I'll talk about the autos. As Jamie mentioned, we're going to let the process play itself out. We have a lot of respect for our union leaders, and we've reached tentative agreements and they're in the ratification process. I think, Union Pacific talked a little bit about some of the issues with BMW ED this morning. And I think the opportunity here is for us to really just work together to let the process play out. I want to respect that process on the union labor side. On the auto side, I mean, there's a lot of things going on. I mean, there's been a number of significant investments announcements in --, especially the Southeast, many of which have been -- we've been a beneficiary of having a relationship with or having the rail access to, whether it's on EV batteries or whether it's on new manufacturing assembly plants. So I think, you'll continue to see obviously, with the government's health increased production for things that support electrification of the automotive industry, and we were well-positioned to take advantage of that, frankly, with how these are playing out. I'm not going to comment on the chip shortage, but you are hearing from the autos that production is picking up. We're seeing more opportunity to deliver more vehicles. So that's a good thing for us in the near-term. And we're watching what's happening on the demand side, but certainly, we're seeing increased opportunity to deliver more vehicles for our automotive customers here at CSX. And longer term, of course, there's significant investment going in electrification. And we're seeing, again, that opportunity to be a part of that as CSX has been a successful part of a number of these announcements. So that will continue, and we're excited to be a part of it. Thanks. Ravi Shankar : Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open. David Vernon : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks taking my question. Jim, congratulations and good luck. Hopefully, we can stay in to us down the road. Wanted to come back to you, Jamie, on the headcount. The guidance is we're going to continue to increase transportation head count or store service. Can you frame what your expectations are for how large you need to get the headcount to get the service levels where you want it to be? And as you think about adding those resources into next year, should we be expecting the training rooms to be as full in terms of the productivity drag that we're going to be trying to model out here. Jamie Boychuk : Well, thank you for that one. I would say our target, as we said, at the end of this year, 7,000 active T&E. We are pushing up to 72 as we move forward. And look, we're doing locomotive engineered training. We don't want to get ourselves caught behind on that. We're still good for a number of years, but we want to take advantage of that. And the trickiest part of headcount on the railroad is getting the headcount in the red spot. And as market conditions change and as things move around out in the field, we're very fortunate that right now we have over 60 employees who have taken temporary transfers to areas where we're short right now, and we're hiring. And we're taking advantage of some of those areas where we do have excess employees. So I'm quite happy with where our numbers are heading. And let's see what that number looks like as we continue to move forward and see where our attrition rate continues to take us to. But yes, absolutely heading into next year, we will see our class sizes most likely start to decline to more normalized attrition rate. We're going to make sure that we keep up with attrition. We don't want to fall behind on that. And we mentioned that, that's an 8% to 10% depending on which area of the network as we continue to rightsize and rightsize in the right places. So yes, you will see our class sizes start to drop when we start hitting those numbers, and we feel quite confident that we're heading in the right direction with those numbers. I wish I had the headcount today that we need it, but it will take a little bit of time and we'll get there. But you will see those class sizes drop to normalize class sizes as we move forward. I appreciate the question. Q \u2013 David Vernon : And if I could just squeeze one little one in there at the end here. As you think about the attrition rates on the recent graduates, have you seen any -- or noticed any differences as a result of some of the changes that are coming in the contract, or are you seeing like maybe some of the labor stick around a little bit longer than maybe we saw earlier in the pandemic when you were trying to ramp up? A \u2013 Jamie Boychuk : Yeah. We're definitely seeing it change lately, and I would not necessarily put that to the contract at this point in time since it's still out for ratification. I think that is a hard work that our labor group has done and the great relationships that we're continuing to build with our union groups on changing pay scales. The pay scale where we went from a step scale of 80%. It takes over five years before we get to 100%. As soon as we started offering to our new hires that they would make the same money as the person sitting next to them in the cab, we definitely saw a change in our retention rate in a positive way. So we are doing things differently. And I think as we continue to make some of those changes and build those relationships, that's only going to get better as we move forward. Q \u2013 David Vernon : I appreciate you letting us squeeze in here. Thanks again. End of Q&A: Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Matthew Korn. Matthew Korn : Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for your interest in CSX. We look forward to speaking with you again on our next quarter. Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Corporation Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Before beginning, the Company would like to remind you that the forward-looking disclosures have been provided on slide 2, and non-GAAP disclosures are on slide 3. I would now like to turn the call over to CSX President and CEO, Joe Hinrichs. You may begin your call. Joe Hinrichs : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our conference call. I'm here with Kevin Boone, Jamie Boychuk, and Sean Pelkey, and we are excited to update you on our quarter results and share our initial views on the upcoming year. I first want to thank all our CSX employees for dedication as they work diligently on behalf of our customers through all the challenges and uncertainties that we faced in 2022. Because of their efforts, our network has continued to run safely and our financial performance has been very strong. We have accomplished a lot over the last four months since I joined the Company. This inventory my visits to our railroads out in the field, visit to our customers, our investors and our many partners in the government, we finalized agreements with our labor unions. We reached a positive solution for the Gulf Coast with our colleagues at Amtrak. And we started to make updates to the nuts and bolts policies on attendance and make a big difference for our employees' quality of life. I am particularly proud to report that our service metrics continue to show real improvement into the fourth quarter after starting a clear upward trend in the early fall. And we are very pleased this progress continued throughout this month. As we anticipated, our hiring successes have allowed us to deliver better customer service that will allow us to capture more business with more volume over time. Looking forward, we are focused on building on our momentum, leveraging our industry-leading operating model and growing this railroad. As we go through the details and answer your questions, I believe that you will get a great sense of the energy and optimism that we all share across the organization of the opportunities ahead for CSX. Now, let's turn to our presentation to review the highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year. CSX generated over $3.7 billion in revenue, up 9% from the previous year on 1.5 million carloads in the quarter. Revenues benefited from higher fuel surcharges, strong core pricing, and higher storage and other revenue. Operating income increased 7% year-over-year to $1.46 billion and our operating ratio was 60.9%. As we've reminded you before, our Quality Carriers trucking business adds roughly 250 basis points to our OR. Earnings per share increased 17% to $0.49. Quickly looking at the full year 2022, our revenues of nearly $15 billion were up almost 20% compared to 2021. Our full year operating income of $6 billion increased 8%. Excluding the gains from the 2021 real estate transaction with the Commonwealth of Virginia, our operating income grew in line with our guidance for double-digit growth. Operating ratio was 59.5% for 2022. Finally, earnings per share increased 16% in 2022 to $1.95. Now, let me turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for details. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Joe. Turning to slide 7. Merchandise revenue increased 7% in the quarter, as a 9% increase in revenue per unit more than offset a 2% decline in volume. For the full year, merchandise revenue increased 9% on 1% lower volume. 2022 merchandise growth was driven by higher fuel surcharge combined with an increasing pricing environment as inflation accelerated through the year. Looking forward to 2023, we have significant network momentum as we began the year, and we expect to leverage industry-leading service into growth opportunities with our customers. This is reflected in our recent customer surveys where we have seen a significant improvement in overall customer satisfaction scores. We see opportunity for solid volume growth in merchandise for the year, led by continued strength in automotive, our growing export plastics business and share gains as customers respond to our improving service. This growth is likely to be partially offset by weaker housing-related and domestic chemical shipments as we start the year. On slide 8, you can see fourth quarter coal revenue increase 20% on 9% higher volume and a 9% increase in revenue per unit. Full year revenue increased 36% on 1% lower volume and a 38% increase in revenue per unit. In 2023, we expect export coal volumes to grow in both, met and the thermal markets. So, we do expect benchmark indexes to decline from the elevated averages of 2022. We're optimistic about the potential positive demand impact of China's reopening. While on the supply side, we have a new 4 million ton met coal mine coming online this year. We also anticipate volume opportunity as we lap 2022 issues, including reduced production at some CSX-served mines and capacity limitations at the Curtis Bay and Mobile export terminals. We expect domestic volumes to be low -- be driven by low thermal stockpiles that remain below historical averages. Healthy inventory levels will allow utilities to better respond to natural gas volatility and more readily dispatch capacity to reduce stress on the U.S. power grid. U.S. steel production, which drives domestic coal consumption to benefit from a recovery in the automotive industry as well as higher infrastructure demand. Now turning to slide 9. Fourth quarter intermodal revenue increased 4% as a 9% increase in revenue per unit more than offset a 5% decline in volumes. For the full year, revenue increased 13% on flat volumes due to a 14% increase in revenue per unit. International intermodal markets continue to be negatively impacted by slowing activity, which looks likely to continue into the first half of 2023. Imports have declined and warehouses have seen elevated inventory levels. To help counter this, we are pursuing several initiatives to bring new solutions to our customers to help them reach new and existing markets. With our domestic intermodal business, we see opportunities even as the trucking market has softened. The team is focused on accelerating truck-to-rail conversions, and now with equipment constraints largely behind us, the team has more opportunity to pursue these initiatives. We are seeing existing customers and those that are new to intermodal adopt strategies to drive more of their transportation spend to rail. The team is doing a great job of identifying these opportunities and building the relationships to drive this growth. Finally, moving to slide 10. Let's discuss CSX's role in reducing our customers' emissions. As we pursue truck-to-rail conversions across the markets we serve, we are actively promoting rail's environmental advantages to our customers. We are increasingly looking for ways to reduce their own emissions. These are board level initiatives for our customers and the opportunity to choose rail over trucks provides real, measurable savings across the entire supply chain. In 2022, CSX customers avoided emitting 10 million tons of carbon dioxide by choosing to ship with CSX versus truck. We continue providing an emissions advantages for our customers, we need to keep innovating. We are not only piloting new technologies that should provide fuel savings like zero to zero, but we are exploring emerging technologies that can be implemented in the future and keep CSX at the forefront of delivering best-in-class efficiencies. Providing visibility to our customers is also a priority. I'm excited about the additional insights we will provide to customers to help them identify and convert incremental freight to rail by utilizing our updated carbon calculator platform that will launch in the first quarter. Lastly, we are proud of the recognition CSX has received for our sustainability efforts, with several of our awards listed on this slide. It is a priority for us to remain an industry leader in environmental stewardship, and we look forward to sharing more details on the several projects we have underway throughout the year. Now, let me turn it over to Jamie to discuss operations. Jamie Boychuk : Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Safety remains our top priority at CSX and has been the foundation for our service restoration. As shown on this slide, a personal injury frequency index was flat from the third quarter and unchanged for the full year. The FRA train accident rate increased from the third quarter but improved versus the prior year. Most importantly, for the second year in a row, we ended the year without a life-changing event. These results were delivered with onboarding over 2,000 new conductors during the year and underscores the safety culture that runs deep within our One CSX workforce. Now hires learned the importance of operating safely in the classroom, but the most impactful lessons occured day in and day out on locomotives and in terminals working with more experienced employees. These daily interactions are reflected in our recent safety performance and emphasize the commitment to our operating safely at CSX. I would like to recognize the over 6,200 employees within CSX's engineering department, which set a record for the lowest number of train accidents in the department history. This is a true accomplishment, given the nature of their ballast-level work. In the year ahead, we will continue to instill the safety culture within our new hires, maintain that culture in our experienced employees and focus on the training and discipline we need to reduce human factor incidents. Moving to the next slide. You can see the success that our entire team has had in driving meaningful service improvement with a clear trend emerging around the middle of the third quarter as staffing levels at many of our locations reached key thresholds. Even with the temporary hit from the weather towards the end of the year, average velocity was up 11% sequentially in the fourth quarter, dwell was down 13%, and trip plan compliance improved by several percentage points for both intermodal and carload. This progress has not stopped as we crossed into 2023 with our service metrics continuing to trend towards pre-pandemic high water levels of late 2019 and early 2020. Our team is focused on improving network fluidity and delivering a consistent, reliable service that will encourage our customers to shift business onto our network, and the data shows that we are well on our way. Now turning to hiring. A robust training pipeline in over 350 conductor promotions over the fourth quarter allow the team to achieve our long-stated goal of 7,000 active T&E employees. Getting our resources to this level has driven the service momentum Joe discussed a few minutes ago. We will continue to support improved service into 2023. Going forward, we expect to stabilize active T&E headcount with targeted hiring continuing for key locations and to offset attrition. I will turn it over to Sean to discuss the financials. Sean Pelkey : Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon. Looking at fourth quarter financial results, revenue increased 9% and operating income increased 7% to $1.5 billion as top line gain outpaced several expense headwinds that I will discuss in more detail on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $6 million favorable compared to the prior year and income tax expense increased by $15 million. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.9% as a result of favorable adjustments to deferred state taxes. Our expected tax rate going forward continues to be 24.5%. Fourth quarter net earnings increased 9% to $1 billion, while EPS grew 17%. Full year 2022 results were highlighted by top line growth of 19%. Operating income was up 8%, which includes a 4-point impact from the Virginia real estate transaction, resulting in 12% growth when adjusting for these gains. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at fourth quarter expense. Total fourth quarter expense increased $210 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by higher fuel costs and inflation. Fuel expense was the most significant driver of $129 million due to higher prices. Labor and fringe expense increased $23 million as the impacts of additional headcount and wage inflation were partially offset by lower incentive compensation. PS&O increased $54 million, primarily due to higher operating support and terminal costs, which will remain somewhat elevated near term as operations continue to improve. PS&O inflation is also running around 5% and the quarter included about $10 million of expense from obsolete inventory and technology write-offs. Depreciation increased by $33 million in the quarter, which includes an ongoing quarterly impact of about $20 million related to the completion of a periodic equipment study. As a result of this study and a higher net asset base, full year depreciation expense will be up approximately $100 million in 2023. Equipment and rents was relatively flat versus the prior year and gains on property dispositions increased $31 million. While we are always looking for opportunities to leverage excess real estate, we'll likely have a few small gains. We aren't expecting any significant sales activity in 2023 at this point. Overall, congestion-related expenses were slightly above $30 million in the fourth quarter, and part of that cost was incurred during winter storms at the end of the period. Despite elevated inflation and increased headcount, we expect to deliver strong cost efficiency throughout 2023, as better fluidity reduces terminal costs, overtime pay and other expenses. Now turning to cash flow on slide 18. Full year free cash flow of $3.7 billion decreased $100 million but was approximately $100 million above prior year results adjusting for the Virginia transaction. Operating cash flow increased over $500 million on higher earnings, more than offsetting approximately $350 million of additional capital spend from our continued focus on both, investing for the long-term reliability of our network, as well as identifying and executing high-return strategic projects. After fully funding capital needs, we returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders in 2022, including over $4.7 billion of share repurchases and $850 million in dividends. We exited the year with a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, including $2.1 billion of cash and short-term investments. Looking forward, we remain committed to a balanced and opportunistic approach to returning excess cash to shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. Joe Hinrichs : Thank you, Sean. Before we discuss our outlook, I want to briefly touch on a couple of key ideas that we think about the ONE CSX concept and how it fits together with the fundamentals of scale railroading at the core of this company. This past year has seen a lot of commentary from many different parties about what scale railroading is and how it's supposed to work. For us, it really is quite simple operating philosophy based on the 5 principles that you see across the top of slide 20. The key, just as it is with the railroad network, is to keep everything in balance, optimize your assets and ensure you show respect for your employees; be disciplined in cost control; and maintain your client to good service. If you can't service your customers well and reliably, all the cost control in the world won't deliver a healthy growing business. CSX has been tremendously successful over the last several years as the company has undergone its transformation. In my view, we've done particularly well across the first three of these scale railroading principles. The opportunity for us now is to focus on getting to even better balance with those last two. We will redouble our efforts in serving our customers and ensuring that our employees, the people who are delivering that service to our customers, feel valued, appreciated and included. To address this and bring out the best of this operating model can deliver, we are building a One CSX culture that prioritizes our relationships and leverages our common goals. Whether you are an employee, a customer or a shareholder, you want a strong and thriving CSX. A healthy culture leverages that alignment to do better together. Under each heading, you will see a couple of the ways we have brought these principles to life over the last year. At the bottom, we give examples of what we aim to do. As an example, for customer service, we have added the T&E resources we have needed to increase capacity, and we have built resilient momentum as our service measures have improved. Now looking forward, it is critical that we ensure that our service metrics reflect our customer experience and that we are measuring and evaluating ourselves in the right way. We also know that we have to improve the way that we interface with our customers and make it easier to do business with us if we are going to win market share from trucks. Every week, we get together as a leadership team. We are challenging ourselves to find new ways to address these issues and take advantage of the great energy that we are creating here at CSX. We have tremendous talent here. And with these principles at our road map, we have a clear, collective goal. Now, let's conclude with a review of our outlook for '23 as shown on slide 21. First, as our service levels keep improving, we expect to achieve overall volume growth for the year, which will outpace real GDP growth, driven largely by strong contributions from merchandise and coal, as Kevin discussed. That said, we do believe that international intermodal volume is likely to be soft, particularly over the first half of the year, as imports have slowed and retailer inventory levels have recovered. Next, the pricing environment remains favorable for us. Our customers have experienced substantial inflation and understand that we face our own cost pressures, including the effects of the recent labor agreements. This transparency has helped us as we renew our pricing agreements, which will support our top line performance. That said, there are a couple of important things to note for 2023. First, we do expect revenues from intermodal storage to decline through the year as supply chain conditions improve. We currently believe it is reasonable to expect we will see a reduction of approximately $300 million in intermodal storage revenue compared to last year, which would imply a quarterly average close to levels seen in early 2021. Second, international met coal benchmarks have recovered from their lows of last fall, but remained volatile. High quality Australia met coal averaged roughly $355 in 2022 and sits at $315 today. It is likely at the average this year will be lower year-over-year, which will impact our coal RPU and our total revenue. Now regarding profitability, we will face cost better in 2023, but we know that we can get better operationally. Where it is possible and where it makes sense, we will make every effort to realize efficiency gains and reduce some of the extra costs that we have been carrying to demand through the congestion and resource constraints of that post-pandemic period. In the end, our margin performance will largely depend on our success in driving more volume through our network and realizing potential operating leverage. Finally, we estimate that our capital expenditures will increase to approximately $2.3 billion, driven by a full year of spending for PNM, additional equipment for quality carriers structure real conversion opportunities, investing in strategic high-return growth projects and the effects of inflation. Now, before we close, I want to emphasize what an exciting time it is for all of us to be a part of the ONE CSX team. We have a common goal to properly grow this railroad, and you are seeing the real progress that we are making toward that goal as we put people and resources into place. I am personally very optimistic about the opportunities ahead, and I look forward to updating you on the achievements throughout the year. Thank you. And with that, we will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] With that, our first question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Hi, everyone. I wanted to ask about yields kind of on a consolidated basis for this year. Obviously, the supplemental revenue and fuel will be somewhat of a headwind. I guess, standing here today, would it be fair to say kind of yield will be flattish on a net basis? And Sean, I guess, if revenue is kind of flat, can you just remind us of kind of the cost that are in the system that you think can be reversed to maybe offset some of the cost inflation? Thank you. Sean Pelkey : Amit, this is Sean. Yes. So, in terms of the yields, I think Joe sort of laid out our expectation on the coal side, perhaps a little bit lower just looking at the comparison versus some of the record levels last year, fuel potentially a little bit of a headwind on a yield basis as well. We'll have a little bit of positive mix, at least in the first half here with the pressures on intermodal, specifically relative to the growth that we expect in merchandising coal. So, that's the yield story. And then, in terms of the costs, I think there's a number of different categories. Certainly, with the intermodal terminals becoming more fluid as some of that traffic moves its way out of the system and start spinning again. We should see some costs come down and the terminals are in very good shape right now. We should see reduction in freight car rents as our cycle times improve and they have already, things like overtime and ancillary costs related to the crews getting hung up last year with delays in service and then locomotive maintenance as we're able to spend the assets faster here. So, those are a few categories where I would say we ought to expect some improvement this year. Amit Mehrotra : Sean, any numbers around that, though? I mean, in terms of -- I know you've talked about $40 million a quarter, but any sort of quantification around some of those efficiencies -- inefficiencies? Sean Pelkey : No specific number, no. I mean, we're going to have inflation headwinds, right? I think, probably in the 4% to 5% range. And our goal is going to be to offset as much of that as we can, both through taking out some of those extra costs that we carried last year as well as continuing to find efficiency gains across the business. Operator : We'll take our next question from Justin Long with Stephens. Justin Long : There are a lot of moving pieces this year in the outlook. So, I was just curious if you could give us any directional color on the year-over-year change you're anticipating for both revenue and operating income? And maybe you could comment on what that trend line could look like throughout the year, if things are going to get better or worse? Would just love some additional thoughts. Sean Pelkey : Yes. Justin, we're not going to get specific in terms of the guidance itself. When you look at first half, second half, the volume comps on coal are a little bit tougher in the second half than in the first half. In terms of intermodal, Kevin talked a little bit about some of the headwinds we're seeing on the international side here in the first half of the year. Those are really sort of the big drivers on the volume side. And then, in terms of all the revenue, that coming down about $300 million for the year, obviously, second half of 2022 was higher than first half of 2022. So we'll be facing sort of a bigger headwind there. And in terms of overall operating income, I think we've laid out some of the factors, right? I think we feel great about our ability to recapture some of the share that we missed in 2022, given where the service product is, given that we've got the headcount that we need and we've got the assets that we need, which is why we're going to grow above GDP. We're going to see gains in merchandise and in coal. We've got a strong price environment. We've got the cost opportunities that I've talked about. And on the flip side of that, we have a few headwinds between the supplemental revenue, the other revenue piece, higher depreciation and probably lower real estate gains. So, those are the factors. But that being said, I think the fact that we are expecting growth. And as we add that growth to the system, we're going to add that strong incremental margins. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : So, I guess, maybe piggybacking off that answer there, Joe. And I know you've only been there a couple of quarters now, but we've heard for a year plus that the real limitation here was headcount, resources and more importantly, service levels that you're delivering. I mean we're seeing that come through the data, I think, pretty strongly in the fourth quarter and as we start out here in January. So, can you talk to how you're going to convert that. And Kevin and Jamie, maybe how closely are your teams working together to ensure that you're growing in the right places? Because I think in the past, we've seen growth that can come in the wrong places and lead to even more op challenges for the other carriers. Joe Hinrichs : Yes. Thanks, Brandon. I think -- this is Joe. First off, thanks for recognizing the pretty significant service improvements and operating performance that we're seeing continuing into January. Our team works great together. So for what it's worth, and clearly, Jamie and Kevin, their offices are next to each other, and they're talking all day long. I'll let them talk more about that. But you referenced the fact that there's been some conversation for quite some time that our challenges were manpower levels and then how that affected the fluidity of the network, we're seeing, as you just referenced, the performance that comes from game of manpower levels where we want them to be and running this network the way it was run prior to the pandemic, which is a very strong operating team. So, the conversion opportunity is to demonstrate some repeatability and predictability around our performance and to show our customers that we now only have -- we have the capacity in place and we have the performance to demonstrate that you should come back to us. And I'm feeling optimistic about that. And the conversations we're having with customers, they're recognizing the improvements that we've shown for the last several months. And they're also confident in our ability to continue that, especially now that we have the manpower levels where we want them to be. So, if you look at it, we're still not meeting all the demand that\u2019s out there for carloads at our business -- for our business. And as we go through the year, we'll look for every opportunity to do that. I'll let Kevin talk more about some of the opportunities in the markets themselves. And then I'll let Jamie talk about the operations. Thanks. Kevin Boone : Yes. Brandon, you did mention obviously, the remarkable improvement in our service that we've seen, and it's a real change, and there's a lot of excitement around this organization about it and what we can do going forward. Joe has brought both, Jamie and I and his teams together to talk about some of the key markets. And there's been a lot of interesting ideas that have come out of that where we can really leverage what we can do service-wise and what we can do creatively to create those opportunities for us. And those things are the fun part of what we do every day, and we're doing a lot less of that and a lot less of customer service and a lot more coming up with new ideas and having those discussions with our customers about growing. I'll tell you, I've had a chance to meet with a lot of customers over the last month or two. And every time, probably 90% of those conversations, we walk out with a lot more opportunities to pursue. Sometimes it means that we have to think differently. We have to introduce customers to what the intermodal product is or what we're capable of. And what we're capable of today is much different, obviously, than what we were capable of a year ago. And so, the team is getting together the whole sales and marketing organization. Jamie is going to spend time with them. I was going to spend time with them next week and it's off to the races. It's up to us to find those opportunities and really pursue them. But I'll hand it over to Jamie to talk about the upside. Jamie Boychuk : I think really, the only thing I can add to that is there's a lot of capacity out there. So what Kevin and I talk about is where is that capacity, what can we do with that capacity, and how do we get out there and sell it. My team is out in the field, ensuring that they are talking with customers more than they ever have because they have time to do that. Previously, we were trying to find a crew to run a train here or there or wherever else. Now they have the time to sit back and deal with any of those customer demands that might be out there that helps Kevin and his team grow. Some of those discussions we have are what does the customer really looking for? Is it the right metrics that we're looking at that the customers are looking for and that first mile, last mile improvement that the team has been able to put together is really record-breaking for us. If I look back at the last 6 years, we haven't -- '22, unfortunately, wasn't the best year for us, but exiting '22 with our customer service and in '23 are some of the world record numbers we just haven't seen. So, our job is to keep producing those numbers and making sure Kevin and the team has what they need to get out there and sell and commit to the customers that -- what you see out there is what you're going to continue to see. So some great collaboration between our two groups. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Chris Wetherbee : So I guess, thinking about the outlook and the optimism around growing merchandise and coal and good incremental margins with that coming on sort of compared, contrasted against some of these what are perceived to be very high-margin sort of revenue headwinds that you have, whether it be the accessorials coming down $300 million or the coal -- export coal yields coming down. When you think about those two relative to each other and the potential for cost out, I guess, any help in terms of how to think about operating ratio or the outcome of that whether it be maybe first half versus second half or across the whole year would be helpful. Just I think that perception of high margin on those headwind pieces is something that we're struggling with a little bit. Sean Pelkey : Yes, Chris. So, on the -- obviously, the coal yields, there's no cost associated with that on the accessorials. There are costs associated with congestion in the terminals as well as needing to rent out space at container yards to move those containers around. So, that's part of the, call it, $150 million or so of additional costs that we carried over the course of this year. So, some of that will adjust down. And then, as we grow the business, our confidence is in the fact that we can grow it at very strong incrementals. And so, you put those together, and I think the question around what happens to the OR really depends on how much growth can we convert. We talked last year about the fact that there was demand out there that we weren't able to meet because we didn't have the crews that we needed in the right places. We've got those crews now. So, there's a real opportunity in front of us. Operator : We'll take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : So, maybe I'll try it this way. How much volume growth do you think you need to be able to grow earnings this year? And then, it sounds like there's going to be some OR pressure this year. You've got some headwinds. I think that's understood. I guess, Joe, I guess, I want to understand, what's your commitment to longer-term OR improvement kind of beyond 2023, just thinking out the next several years. Sean Pelkey : Yes. Scott, on your question about how much growth, I don't think we're in a position to answer that one right now that you kind of run it through the model, but I think we've given you enough of the factors. And I think the fact that we sort of pointed to coal and merchandise as areas where we think we can sort of meaningfully outperform whatever the economic indicators that are out there is a reflection of the fact that we feel good about where we are from a capacity and service standpoint and the ability to sell into that market. But, we're not going to give you a specific number there. Joe Hinrichs : This is Joe. On the OR question, Scott, I think there's a couple of points here. I'm very confident that our team will continue to deliver on the denominator side, operating improvements and continue to show strong operating results. On the numerator side of the equation, you're right in the sense that there have been -- there were some things that were strong tailwinds last year, the fuel surcharge, intermodal storage, the coal price, et cetera, and we'll see how much of that repeats in 2023. But that certainly helped the numerator side of OR last year and maybe some of those things won't be quite as strong in 2023. But having said that, on the numerator side, the volume growth opportunity that we can now go after with the confidence that we have in our operating model and our performance and knowing that for our customers who are feeling cost pressures and feeling inflation pressures and potentially even feeling effects of a slowing economy are going to be looking for cost reduction opportunities. And so, we feel very, very strongly that this year and beyond, continue to demonstrate the capacity that we have in our performance, the growth opportunity will be there for us as we earn the right to do that and get that business. And our customers will be wanting to do more business with us. In addition, of course, we have the environmental advantage of ESGs and emissions when it comes to rail. So, all that being said is we're not going to put a target out there for OR. We're very proud of our performance. I mean, last year, with Quality Carriers, we still had an operating ratio for the year under 60, so we know what it's like to -- and that was not at our optimum performance level as we all admit. So, we believe there is a strong performance inside of this company that will continue to be delivered. The uncertainty is around some of those revenue pieces in this year and beyond. So, our challenge is to deliver real growth in the business, which does deliver strong incremental margins and continue to control our costs, utilize our assets well. And so, that should lead to very strong performance within an operating band of OR that we'll be comfortable with. At the end of the day, this company is very focused on delivering margins, delivering growth with -- profitable growth with margin improvement, which should lead over time to a good OR. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Jon Chappell : Kevin, as we watch these service metrics improved significantly since really the middle part of last year, and is intermodal trip plan performance just consistently around 90 and industry best standards. It's a little confusing that even given the headwinds, maybe your intermodal volumes are running lighter on a year-over-year basis than most of the other Class 1s. Can you help us explain any disconnect between those improving metrics and some of those intermodal shortfalls that may be unique to you? And maybe that also ties in then to explaining a bit more on some of the strategic opportunities that you noted in your prepared remarks? Kevin Boone : Yes. I think when you look at -- and look, three years -- or three weeks doesn't make a year, so we've got a lot of work to do as a team. But we -- I think you'll see over the last two years and through the pandemic that we really outperformed the industry and a lot of that growth that we mentioned before came on the international side. And we don't pay -- we don't spend a lot of time thinking about the other Class 1 railroads, but I do believe we probably have a little bit higher percentage of our businesses, obviously, exposed to that international market where we've had a great, great success, and we see a long-term outlook that's very positive for us. So, I think that's probably contributing to some of the things we're seeing here recently. But we've obviously had great performance and continue to think we'll win share in the market. The team has got a number of initiatives that will take form later on in the year and that will drive incremental business to the railroad. So excited of what we can do in the quarters ahead. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Tom Wadewitz : I just had a clarification for you first, before the question. I don't know if I caught what your GDP assumption is or which forecast you're referring to just in terms of how we anchor to the volume comment? And then, Joe, I wanted to see if you could offer some more thoughts about your comments on relationships? And I think tying into labor, how do you think about how you want that relationship to change? Does that cost you something to do that? And what's the benefit over time? Is it just probably attrition is running 15% a year, we wanted to get down to 5%, and that saves us sort of help service. Just some broader thoughts on when you talk about relationships and labor, what do you mean by that? And how do you think about what that does over time? Sean Pelkey : Tom, on your GDP question, roughly 0.5% growth is the GDP number that we're looking at. And so our guidance is to grow in total above that with intermodal headwinds and solid growth across the other markets? Joe Hinrichs : Yes. Tom, this is Joe. Thanks for the question regarding labor. So lots of thoughts here, but I'll try to be concise. First, just a reminder to everybody that this is a service business. And we provide our service to our customers. We move their goods from point A to point B, and we're proud of the way we do that. But remember that in the service industry and service business, it's all about the employees. You're not selling a product, you're not developing a product. You're really relying on your employees to represent your company in the service of your customers. I start there because that's so critically important to understand why it's so critical to have a really strong relationship with your employees, including those represented by unions because they are the individuals doing the work, providing -- moving goods to make Point A to Point B and serving our customers. And so, the motive here isn't to try and leverage relationships to try and decrease costs or find a dollar here and there. It's all about building a culture where our employees feel valued and appreciated, included in the service of our customers in a way that we can demonstrate that CSX is unique and different from the other options they have, and provides a value proposition to our customers that we think can be very, very special. And so, there's a lot of -- I've been spending a lot of time out in the field, Jamie and I travel almost every week. And as I've learned a lot about this industry, about this business, there's a lot of variability and a lot of independence when it comes to the work that's done now in the field, because this is not a factory assembly line where you're stationed in a certain position and you've got a cycle time to meet, and if you don't make it, all bells and whistles go off. When you have your employees motivated, engaged and feeling valued, their efforts to support what your initiatives are, are greatly enhanced. And that's just human nature, and that's really what's important about this relationship is that listening to our employees, resolving their issues, working on things that improve their efficiency and their work life balance and their work life experience and safety and other things, leads to a better service product for our customers, which ultimately leads to a better business for everyone, including our employees. From the labor side, it's really about building relationships and generating trust and getting to the point where you're going to have real dialogue around solutions and around ideas and around understanding each other's desires and perspective so that we can find the best solutions. I have found in my past experiences that when you get to that point, you have a healthier business and you have happier, safer employees who are working better together to serve the customers. That's really the desire here is to provide that kind of opportunity for our employees. Now, what comes with that? Lower attrition, better recommendations for the referrals, for new hires and in the family and fund network, and just a better experience for everybody. So that's really a big part of the ONE CSX culture initiative is all around building this team, working all together and labor is a big part of that. And so, it's a little more complicated in the rail industry with 12 different unions. However, we feel really good about where we are with our team, Jamie and his team are working every day, having lots of good discussions. We voluntarily on our own, changed our attendance policy based on feedback. That's really impactful to our employees. That's a great first step in this relationship. We're listening to them every day. We're working on problem solving, and ultimately, with the purpose in mind of creating that environment where employees want to be a part of that and want to serve our customers better. And with that comes a much more efficient operation and, frankly, better service for our customers, which ultimately leads to opportunity for growth. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Ken Hoexter : Hey. Good afternoon. And thanks for the rundown there, Joe. Just maybe can we clarify? Sean, I guess you're looking for volume growth offset by accessorial and cold yield declines, efficiency gains with service costs gone, but inflation up. But I just want to clarify, you're not specifically committing to income or operating improvement for the year, right? There was no outlook on what that means for collateral or the EPS line? Sean Pelkey : That's right. Ken Hoexter : And then Jamie, the on-time originations fell to 54%. I think they've fallen now 12 of the past 13 quarters. Isn't the whole name of the game of what you're doing with precision railroading to leave on time and get that moving? Maybe talk to me about what the network needs to do to fix that? And Joe, I don't know if you've come in what your thoughts are on operations, what balance of operations versus top line growth. Jamie Boychuk : Okay. And you're right. The last couple of years, really, we've seen our on-time originations drop. And that's been -- it's been consistent, unfortunately, because of the manpower situation we've been in. I'm happy to say, over the past three weeks into this year, we started to get back up to our record highs. The team is hitting up over 85% on-time, which is great. It starts to get us balanced. And as we continue to onboard some more folks, we'll continue to get that driven up to that record of, I think, in 2019, where we're up around 89%, 90% on-time origination. And that's what we're shooting for. So, it is important. It's an important metric we'll watch. We made some decisions last year to back off a little bit on that, so we could connect as much traffic as we could and not leave things behind when we did have a crew and make sure we took advantage of that crew, and we maximized what we could on those train starts. Not saying that we're letting that go at all. We're going to maximize what's on each one of these trains that we run out there car-wise, but we've now got the people to balance the assets across the network, and you can see it. If you take a look at our velocity, and you take a look at our dwell numbers just in the past 3, 4 weeks, you can see that the network is running much more fluid. We hit that magic number just into the new year that we're looking for that 7,000 T&E count. And actually, as a matter of fact, we're at 7,100 today. And we're going to push that number a little bit more to cover vacation coming up in the next few months. So, we're going to make sure that we've got the right headcount. We're going to make sure that we've got the right people in the right places, and we continue to drive those metrics that will drive the rest of the service metrics. I mean, again, TPC, whether it's carload, intermodal, all the rest of it that you see that we've put out there, we're starting to get back to our -- as a matter of fact, we're beyond our record numbers on some of those service metrics. So, we're going to provide a product that Kevin and his team can go out there and sell and start growing this company. Joe Hinrichs : Yes. So Ken, thanks for the question. A couple of just additional comments. We spend a lot of time as a team talking about our customer service metrics, whether it's on-time, originations and arrivals, whether it's in the last mile, first mile, those kind of things. And I'm really pleased with how the team is looking at everything. And we want to make sure that we're seeing the world through the lens -- through the eyes of our customers, which is why we get feedback on surveys. And Kevin referenced, we've seen the best results in our customer surveys that we've seen in quite some time. So, I feel really good about that. Now, the balance between top line growth and operations, I think they're intertwined. And I said this in October. I feel even more strongly about it now. We have a phenomenal opportunity here at CSX to leverage our strength in our operational performance that you've seen pre-pandemic. You're seeing now again to earn the right to talk to our customers about getting more business. And that is a lot better than chasing top line growth, and to be able to demonstrate that you can rely on us with our capacity and our service levels and our prioritization on your service to be there for you. And I believe very strongly, there's business opportunity there. So, we can allow that to happen naturally organically because we have a better product. We have a lower price than most trucking. And we have a better ESG solution and to do that the right way. So that's why we've been so focused on getting the manpower where it needs to be and really getting -- making sure that we're focusing on the right metrics for the business, and I'm really pleased with where we are. So, I feel even more strongly today than I did in the call in October about this opportunity. We can't predict what's going to happen in the economy this year, and that's part of what you're seeing in some of this dialogue is we're not exactly sure what happens in the second and third quarter. We're very pleased with how the year has started. However, we don't know exactly where the economy is going to go, given rising interest rates and some of the other things that are going on. Actually, you could say that in the data that we've been seeing that some parts of the economy started slowing down really in October-November. And we just didn't see it in our business because we couldn't meet some of that demand back then. But we feel really good about where we are. We're not going to chase top line growth. We're continuing to leverage our operating model, but we believe it's there to be earned, and that's the conversation we're having with our customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Brian Ossenbeck : Maybe just on that last part about unmet demand. We heard that a lot across the different Class I rail conference calls. And is there a way, since you're counting on it and you're seeing some of it through surveys and clearly, the service has improved. Is there a way you can sort of try to quantify that for us in terms of what you lost or what you think is coming back with fill rates or anything else you can put around there in terms of a metric? And what gives you that confidence that you can count on that coming back, not just the interest level is there, especially when you have a softer macro and probably contract truckloads heading lower as well? Kevin Boone : Yes, Brian. Hey, it's Kevin. I think Joe actually touched on this really, really well. And I think what's probably a little bit underappreciated what's happened in some of the things that we've seen in some of the major markets that we serve today is -- and I had referenced this previously on other earnings calls, we were in that 60%, 70% type of order fill rates pretty much through most of 2022. What happened starting in, let's call it, the late third quarter, fourth quarter in some of these markets, we saw those orders come down. And obviously, our fill rates kind of remained -- or on mix or whatever our volumes that we're serving for those customers remained relatively flat. And so, we saw our fill rates start to increase, and they're at higher levels now and the markets we see maybe the demand, what they're requesting is down 30%, yet our volumes are slightly down today. What my expectation is and what we're starting to see is that they've already overshot what they saw what would be a normal demand environment, and we're seeing order flows start to increase. And so, that's encouraging that it feels like in some of these markets, we've established the bottom. Anything can happen in the economy, but it feels that way as of right now, and we'll see how it plays out. But a point on that is as those ores come back and as we're able to meet that demand going forward, that would imply growth versus last year. And so, that's embedded in what some of the guidance that we provided today and why we have a confidence around accelerating or beating that GDP number is that we're going to go and capture those orders and those demand that the customer has out there this year with the replenished workforce and all the things that the operations team is doing. Brian Ossenbeck : And would you expect that to be more heavily weighted on the merchandise side because that probably was a carload before, or are you seeing real momentum on truckload conversion, maybe more on the intermodal side? Kevin Boone : Yes. I think you'll see it really start on the carload side. That's where we -- when I referenced the order fill rates, that's really carload specific. You'll remember on the intermodal side, it really was an equipment issue. Good thing is those equipment issues, whether it's chassis, containers, I think we have plenty of those in most locations now throughout that market. And you've heard different commentary around that, but there is some softness in the truck market today. There is some optimism, hopefully, as we get into the back half of the year that that will firm up a bit, and we have every intention of taking advantage of that market as it comes to us. We have the premier service in intermodal and it's been reflected in our growth over the last couple of years, and we continue to expect to capitalize on that. Operator : Our next question comes from Ariel Rosa with Credit Suisse. Ariel Rosa : So, I wanted to stay on that topic. You mentioned some softness maybe in the trucking market. I wanted to ask to what extent that's an impediment to intermodal volume growth. And then, in a more normalized environment, how do you think about CSX's ability to kind of outgrow GDP or maybe something around kind of the magnitude at which you could outgrow GDP versus this kind of loose truck market? Kevin Boone : Yes. The truck market is obviously -- centers around our intermodal product. That's where we go direct with truck, not that we don't compete on our carload business as well, but that's where you see the sensitivity sometimes. In international market, as everybody is aware of, has been weak, and we've got -- we've had great growth there, and we have a great market that we continue to expect to grow over time. But, as I mentioned in my recent comments -- opening comments that that market probably will be down somewhat double digits in the first half of the year. And hopefully, as the economy stabilizes and there's some green shoots out there that we'll see some better growth into the second half of the year, at least, not the decreases that we're experiencing today. I think, every bit of intention here is across our portfolio that we're going to outgrow the macro economy. And I think there's a lot of things at tailwinds at our back. But we've had a huge success rate on our industrial development side. We have a lot of new projects that are coming online when you look out beyond this year. Big, big backlog, probably the largest backlog that anybody here can remember in a long time whether it's new auto plants, metals plants, all those across the board, we've really had a good success rate there, and that will give us growth going forward. So, our intention is to outgrow the economy. And I know that's not something that the railroads have been able to do. But I think there's -- with the service product that we're going to have, I think that's really, really possible going forward. Ariel Rosa : Thanks for that Kevin. And then just really quickly on some of those projects, any thoughts on kind of what the incremental margins could look like around that? Kevin Boone : I think -- I don't know a business that we're bringing on where the incremental margins aren't very attractive and are in a very good rate of return for us. I put my finance hat on every time I look at the business, and we're not going to chase unprofitable business just to show top line growth. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Fadi Chamoun : Maybe first on those two boxes and the guiding principles, and Joe, you highlighted improving customer service and developing the employees. And especially with respect to some of the conversation maybe you're having with customers, do you feel that there's going to be a lag between when you start demonstrating the success on the service side and really penetrating that share of wallet with these customers, or do you think there is really a quick potential turnaround between kind of making those improvements in the time, that market share improvement? And second, maybe a follow-up on the test conversation with Kevin, now like looking over into 2024 to 2025 and assuming we're back into a normalized GDP, given the backlog that you have and given some of these initiatives and the investments you've made in QC and PanAm. Outside of coal, is there a reason why you can't grow volume mid-single digits as we get into this more normalized environment? Ex coal, obviously. Joe Hinrichs : I'll take -- this is Joe. I'll take the first part and ask Kevin to take the second since you directed at him. From my perspective, the opportunity here to grow the business really comes from increasing that service product. Now, your question around the timing of that, it's all really individually dependent on each customer, where they are, where their cost pressures, where their capacity issues and what are they looking for. So, we can't use a blanket statement that if we demonstrate these levels of performance for three months, the next comes from it. Really in our conversation with our customers, it\u2019s really around their confidence in our ability to be repeatable and reliable. And so the answer to that question is different for each customer. But I can tell you, they're all watching and they're all noticing and they're all letting us to know that they're really appreciating the progress that we're making. So, it will play out over time. But there's nothing inconsistent that we're hearing from our customers about their appreciation for it and recognizing how important it is. Kevin? Kevin Boone : Yes. I think the question was, is there a reason why we can't grow mid-single digits. I think Jamie answered the question on the network side, we have a lot of capacity to grow into and it's -- we're going to use that capacity and go after wallet share with our existing customers and identify new customers. So, there's no constraints from that perspective. Obviously, that putting up mid-single digits volume and then with price is a pretty attractive algorithm, we'll see what we can do and what the market conditions are at the time. It's a more normalized GDP growth rate, 3% or 4%, then that's different than maybe 1% to 2%. So, we'll see how things materialize as we get out of '23, and '24, '25. The great thing is we have some tailwinds from new customers that will be on our railroad, and that will give growth above the economy, hopefully, that will add to that algorithm over time as we build the funnel of all the projects that we've been able to develop and that will be coming on line in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Two quick ones here. First, you've said you can grow GDP plus. Many of your peers are using industrial production as a benchmark. In fact, I think one of them has come out and said a couple of years ago that they don't think they can grow faster than GDP going forward, and they think they can try and outpace industrial production instead. So, a, do you think GDP is the right benchmark for you and kind of what gives you the ability and confidence to think that you can grow faster in GDP in the long run? And just as a quick follow-up. I think you had said that incentive comp was a tailwind to numbers in '22. How do we think about incentive comp in '23? Thank you. Sean Pelkey : Yes. Ravi, this is Sean. So on your GDP plus comment, look, I think if you look historically and you run the correlations, our business tends to move more closely with the underlying IDP indicators, particularly across the merchandise segment, maybe a little more on GDP in intermodal. But you look at this year specifically, the projection for IDP is a decline and the projection for GDP is growth, and we think we can grow the business. So, it made a lot of sense this year to peg it off of GDP. On your question on incentive comp, I mean, the year has to play itself out. We always go into the year planning to hit the targets that we set internally. And so, on that basis, incentive comp would be down a little bit year-over-year versus 2022, but we'll see how that plays out as the year continues. Operator : We'll take our next question from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Cherilyn Radbourne : A question on labor for me. Some of your peers have talked about taking a different approach to furloughs going forward, just given that labor has become more scarce and valuable. So, I was hoping you could offer some thoughts on how you would approach headcount in the event that freight demand surprises to the downside, so that you don't lose the investments you've made in hiring and training this year? Joe Hinrichs : Well, Cherilyn, thanks for the question. We've got the same stance as we did last quarter. Our T&E workforce is not a workforce that we would look at furloughing as we move forward. We're future -- we're looking into the future, really important that we -- Kevin and I obviously are -- as we stated here today, work really close together to see not only what's happening today, but what's happening in six months from now, what's happening a year from now. We know that there's customers coming on. And you're absolutely right. The conductors and filling those positions takes a long time. It can take up to six months to fill a conductor's position. And we can pull the trigger. Look, if there's a downturn in business, we can use the attrition that's there, which is up to 10%. So, it's easy for us to hold back classes if we need to, to bring those numbers down and rightsize it if we need to. But as we continue to move forward, we're looking at continuing to build our numbers up so we can get to a point where we can cover vacation time and making sure that our employees get the time off that at times they've struggled over the last couple of years. So, we're very close to that number, as you can see from our results that we're quite happy that we're moving in the right direction with our service. And it's a commitment that we've made that we're going to continue to be looking forward and not doing any knee-jerk reactions and pull that trigger with respect to attrition if required. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : Joe, last time you spoke with us on the October call, you had a few days on the job, that's a few months now. Can you talk a little bit about when you'll be able to -- or I think you'll be able to roll out your strategy to the Board and investors? And any events like an Investor Day, other format around that as you look forward to kind of getting to where you want to be to really kind of put your stamp on the business? Thank you. Joe Hinrichs : Yes. Thanks for the question. Just first, from a philosophy standpoint, this is a really talented team. And so, we -- we're doing all this together as a leadership team. We get together every Monday, we talk about the business, go through all elements of it. And so I want to just emphasize that. I'm one piece of that team, but this is a team effort. I'm really proud of the -- to get to work with every day. It has been 4, 5 months since -- role -- fast together. But 20-some visits out in the field and all the other discussions with all customers and regulators and everything else. I feel like I'm learning very quickly, but there's still a long way to go on that learning curve as far as the core business. I'm really excited about the emphasis we have on the customer, and I'm really proud of the progress the team has made on the operating side. All that to say, I'm not sure that -- I'm not sure it makes sense to have an Investor Day just to have an Investor Day. We want to do that when we really have some meaningful things to talk about from strategy or technology or some other things. So, we trust that we'll do that at the right time when it can be meaningful and not just something we put on the calendar every year just to do. We want it to be impactful. We don\u2019t want to take everyone's time and we want it to be important. As far as the strategy and discussion with the Board, I hinted this a little bit in October, but I spent a lot of time with the Board as individuals and collectively in consideration of doing this in their consideration of me. So, we had a lot of good conversation over multiple months about the opportunity here and where to put the emphasis and where to really take advantage of the strengths that exist here. And so, I feel really, really good about the alignment we have with our Board, with our team here and the work we're doing. And I'm very pleased with the progress we've made with One CSX in just four months' time or so. You can feel the momentum on the culture side, you can feel the momentum on what that means for how employees are working together and then the result effects on our service. So, I don't feel compelled to come out with some major strategy just because to put my fingerprints on it in some short time period. I think the key thing is, we have a talented team here, we have a strong operating model, we have a good business. I mean we made $6 billion on less than $15 billion of revenue last year, and we didn't perform our best last year. So, we're now starting to demonstrate those performance levels that we showed pre-pandemic levels. So, that's a long way of saying that I'm very optimistic about the business and excited about it. And you'll see incremental ideas, initiatives come out, but we really have a strong foundation. And really executing off of that foundation and leveraging the strengths we have is our biggest near-term opportunity, as you've heard the team talk about tonight. So, just trust that when we're ready to have some more meaningful dialogue on some new initiatives and whatnot, then we'll have the right forum to do that. In the near term, you'll continue to see us on a weekly, monthly basis, talking about the things we're doing and demonstrating where our priorities are. And that's really around, as we've said many times, improving our customers' experience with us and our service we deliver to them. And the experience our employees have as team members of ours as part of One CSX and just getting the most out of working together to make that happen. So, those points won't change over time, but how we use technology, how we use our operations and other initiatives will change, and we'll talk about that at the right time. But just to summarize what our team is saying here tonight, we're very confident about the things we can control in our business, our operating performance, our capacity now with our manpower, team we have, the skills and the capabilities we have. There's a little uncertainty about the health of the economy this year. So we watch that very carefully. But we feel really good about how we come into 2023, how we're performing so far in 2023 and the feedback we're getting from our customers. And so, we'll leverage that to show that we can deliver growth and that we can build an even stronger business. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : So, Joe, I wanted to ask you a question on the intermodal share take a little bit differently. I'm just curious about your thoughts on what kind of targets you're going to be holding the team accountable to delivering over, call it, a 3- or 5-year view. As you step back and look at the intermodal market in the East, it's grown at about 38 basis points a year for the last 7 years. you guys are doing about 3 million units, and you were doing about 3 million units in 2015, '16. What should we be thinking about on a 5-year view about how much share you could actually put onto the railroad. Not looking at the guidance for this year because the economy is weak, and I get it's tough to forecast. But I'm just trying to think like what kind of target are you putting out there for the team to hit? Joe Hinrichs : Yes. Thanks for the question. I'm not going to get into specifics about what our targets are long term. But just conceptually, let's talk about it. Just stepping back and learning about this industry and staring at it more closely over the last many months, even before I joined CSX. We interchange a lot with a number of our Class 1 colleagues. And so, this is an industry issue as well as a CSX issue, and that is around real growth, volume growth. So you referenced it. So how do we make that happen? We have capacity. We have a strong fixed cost base, a very -- a substantial fixed cost base and incremental margins are really good. So, that lends itself to really wanting to grow, like most businesses, those kind of -- and we have strong margins to start with. So, how do we grow? As an industry, as a company, I mean that's the discussion we're having and the opportunities we're pursuing over the next several years. So, from our perspective, we need to demonstrate to ourselves and to others that we can grow volume ideally above either GDP or industrial production, whatever, where do you want -- ways you want to measure it year after year and bring the margins that come with that to show growth in the business, not just on pricing, but also on volume. That is something we're looking to do, and we'll continue to challenge ourselves to do. With that comes the customer service metrics and demonstrating continual progression there in things like trip lane compliance and first mile last mile, but also in with the way the customers measure things. Are the MTs there when they need to be there? Did the load get there when they need to be there? So they can manage their manpower and their business, et cetera. So, continual progress, Jamie referenced it on the customer side. And then on the employee side, with our employee surveys and with our relationships with our union leaders and our union partners, et cetera, how do we become the kind of environment where -- back what we've had over time where you have just all this multigenerational activity because people are so proud to be a part of the CSX team and how we work together and the culture that we have around each other. So, there's ways to measure those things and challenge ourselves to be accountable with showing progress. But, if you bucket them into those areas and then, of course, we will never forget the financial results. Those are largely outcomes of all the things we're talking about, but continuing to look at our operating efficiency, continue to look at our operating income, of course, -- and our cash flow, we will always do that. So without getting into specific, you can just think about where the emphasis points are and where the priorities are. And then, I've referenced technology a couple of times here tonight, and I want to come back to that. How do we leverage technology to be more efficient, to be safer, to better serve our customers and to modernize our business across the enterprise, whether that's in the office or in the locomotive. And we see a lot of potential there. Steve Fortune has joined us. We've got a great technology team. We're excited about that, too. So, a number of things to think about and challenge ourselves for the future. And we'll have more to say about it over time. But when we get to a point where we are definitely where we want to be with our employee relationship and we have a safe, trusting environment with our union partners, where we look for solutions and work for both sides and then improve the work-life of our employees while also serving our customers better and having a more efficient business, we can achieve all those things together. Those are the objectives. And I believe we'll get there, and we'll do it the right way. David Vernon : Okay. Jamie, if I could just sneak a little follow-on in there. As you think about the headcount plan from where we are today, are you expecting to continue to grow it into the year, or do you think we've got enough sort of resource on the property to maintain the service improvements? Jamie Boychuk : I would say we are continuing to qualify conductors every week. We still have another 600 folks out there in training out in the field and some in Atlanta. And what we're doing as we move forward -- now remember, the retention rate has not been all that good with the new hires. So, if we continue to work on that retention rate, and we have a 10% all out with respect to just regular attrition as we move forward. I'm looking for another few hundred folks onto our headcount to get us into vacation season as we move forward and some of the growth that Kevin and the team see as we continue to move into the year. So, I'm comfortable with the headcount we have now, while the vacation season is low, but over the next few months, we're going to see that spike come up. And the way that we are guiding into that or gliding into that, our numbers are going to be able to hold up for what we need to not only continue where we are with our metrics, but to actually continue to improve on them as we move into the year. So, we are -- it's probably one of the first times in a couple of years, I've been on one of these calls, and I can say we're comfortable that our headcount is at a good spot and continuing to move into a good spot as we move into the year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Just want to circle back to that last question a little bit more. Joe, you had talked about some of the processes in doing business easier with rails. Could you maybe expand on that a little bit? Do you feel like in these customer surveys, the ease of doing business with rails is sort of a key limitation right now for some of that structural share gain? And is that something that's maybe within the next 2 to 3 years that you guys can attack that, or is it much longer-term opportunity there? Joe Hinrichs : Yes. Thanks. It's a great opportunity. And we do need to make it easier to do business. We recognize and we referenced that in our commentary tonight. I mean you think about the level of visibility that we have in the rail industry compared to packaged goods and UPS, FedEx, those kind of things, we have to improve in that area, and we will improve in that area. It's an industry issue as well as a CSX issue. That's an example. How do we get even more predictable and give more visibility to our performance and et cetera. So there's a number of ways we need to improve to improve the customer experience in our business, make it easier to do business with us. Kevin referenced, we've got some new things in ShipCSX to help with calculations for emissions reduction and those kind of things. How do we keep helping customers get better and be able to use our systems better and be able to work with those better. There's a number of ways we can make that happen. At the end of the day, the thing they want most from us, of course, is to be there on time and to deliver on time and to be reliable in doing that. So, that's obviously where our focus is. But clearly, we can make it easier for our customers to do business with us, and we can provide more information and visibility and that's some of the things that the industry is working on. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : My question for Kevin, looking back now at Quality Trucking, I know this was a little bit of an experiment when you made that purchase, and I see in your CapEx plan you're devoting a bit of capital towards it. So just curious as to what your take has been on it now that it's been under your umbrella for a little while now. Is it by calling it out in CapEx, are you expanding the fleet? Are you strategically looking at growing your trucking operation relative to your rail operation? And could you be looking for any other avenues outside of the company and from an M&A perspective into that trucking space if you see those opportunities pop up here in 2023? Kevin Boone : Yes. I mean, first of all, quality is a very, very unique asset in a lot of ways. First, it touches our most valuable market in our largest market, which is chemicals. And I can't tell you how insightful. They have different contexts than we do on the trucking side, where those purchase managers have never dealt with truck and introducing that product to them has been eye-opening and it's something very, very new. When we talk about the CapEx related to QC this year is really a rail product, it's not more trucks that we're investing in. It's the ISO tanks that go on the railroad. And I am -- if Randy was sitting here today talking about it, he is very, very happy with how it's gone so far. The customer uptake has been pretty incredible so far. We've seen a lot of success. And our only issue is we haven't gotten them fast enough. And so that's a good problem to have, and we're going to continue to take delivery of those. Randy has come from the trucking market for a long time, and he has even been surprised about the service product and how quickly we can turn these assets for him on each side. So, things have gone extraordinarily well there. The intermodal network is ideal to convert a lot of this traffic that moves over truck today. It's meeting the customer requirements, and we're getting more and more demand from those customers out there as it gets into the market. So, that's really where the focus and the uptick in the CapEx that we talked about earlier are coming on that rail product that we're extraordinarily excited about. And we just think that the chemical customers, in particular, are looking for a holistic solution and it's pretty powerful to go in there and be able to talk and look at their network and tell them what we think fits from a rail perspective and what fits from a trucking perspective. Joe Hinrichs : And just when you think about quality, even on the operating side, we're utilizing our current terminals. And yes, that CapEx is exactly right, where we're buying the ISO tanks and we're preparing. But everything else is already there, that fixed asset is there. So, this -- when we went into this, Kevin and I were somewhat hand-in-hand looking at this business thing is this what we want? Is this going to work, and it's really falling in really well. And I would say -- on the asset side is just we didn't get the ISO tanks. We'd like to get them quicker. We'd like to get more of them because there's more business, I believe that Randy and his team can get working with Kevin and his team. And our intermodal terminals have the capacity and the trains have the capacity. So it's just -- it's a great product on the operating side and very easy for us to move as well. So it fits really, really well. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Kauffman : I'll just be quick. Sean, you were talking about employee levels, and it looks like cost inflation on the new contract, probably around 5% per employee. Year-on-year employees about 7%, 8% for the first half of 2023. So if I look away from fourth quarter where the incentive comp helped lower that and I looked at kind of what's the right run rate for modeling for labor cost inflation. Should I be thinking about something in the high single-digit, 10-percent-ish range for the first half of the year before productivity offsets that? Sean Pelkey : Yes. Jeff, I think on a gross basis, right, on a full year basis, the impact of inflation on the labor line is in that ballpark, right, mid-single digits. And if you look at the headcount, if we didn't hire anybody additional all year long, we'd be up 4% year-over-year. Jamie talked about adding a couple of hundred to the headcount, so call that 5% up year-over-year. So, there's your 10%, but we are confident that as we -- as the network continues to spend, we'll be able to drive some efficiency on the labor line. We\u2019ll also cycle, as you alluded to, the true-up that we had to make in the third quarter on the back wages. So, that will be a little bit of an offset. Jeff Kauffman : All right. So that will be a little better in the second half. But I guess at the end of the day, how much of that labor cost do you think you can offset through productivity? Is there a target out there? Do we just kind of see what we can achieve? Sean Pelkey : Well, yes, we've got targets and we're going to reduce over time. We're going to reduce crude travel and some of the ancillary costs that go along with that as the network spins faster, and we'll be able to offset a good chunk of it, offsetting 5% inflation or sort of in that range and another 5% headcount would be a lot in a single year. So, we're on the right track. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

And I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Matthew Korn : Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  In the presentation accompanying this call, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2 followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3.  And with that, it's my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Joe Hinrichs. Joseph Hinrichs : All right. Good evening, everyone. Thank you, Matthew, and thank you all for joining our conference call. Working together, the ONE CSX team delivered a strong first quarter, driven by solid pricing as well as volume growth in our merchandise and coal businesses. With sufficient resources in place, we are able to use the benefits of our scaled railroad model to deliver improvement in our customer service performance that are driving real tangible financial results. Our network is running well, and we intend to do even better and show that CSX can sustain reliable service over time, which is essential for us to profitably grow our railroad. 2023 has already proven to be a very active year. One of our top priorities after the national union agreements were finalized last December was to address the matter of Paid sick leave for our union employees. I am very pleased that CSX demonstrated important leadership here. Starting in February, we were the first U.S. class [Technical Difficulty] more details about the specific proactive steps we have been taking to make CSX safer. I have also been actively involved in discussions with our leaders in Washington and the across states our network about some of the legislation that has recently been proposed. They know that it's better for our economy, our environment and our communities for railroads to move a greater share of the nation's freight. They also know that CSX is eager to be part of solutions that are effective, data-driven and will make our whole industry safer. We do not want safety performance to be a competitive advantage for CSX, but wanting to be something our entire industry is proud of. We have been encouraged by our conversations with senior policy leaders and we'll continue to engage with them in the months ahead, sharing best practices and building on our common ground.  We are confident that the industry will emerge in this period stronger, more aligned and better at sharing safety best practices. Now let's turn to our presentation to review the highlights of the first quarter. We moved nearly 1.5 million carloads in the first quarter and generate over $3.7 billion in revenue, which was 9% higher than the previous year. Operating income increased 14% year-over-year to $1.46 billion, and our operating ratio was 60.5%, which includes the OR impact of the quality carrier destruction business, as we've discussed in the past. Finally, earnings per share increased 23% to $0.48. When I came to CSX last fall, we were very clear with our intention to build on this company's excellent operating model by strengthening our relationships with our employees and serving our customers better. It is still early but you will hear clear examples of how we are starting to achieve this as Kevin, Jamie and Sean talk about the details, what was a very strong quarter.  Now let me turn it over to our team. Jamie Boychuk : Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Every quarter, you hear us emphasize the importance of safety on our network. This is a fundamental part of our culture and defines how we execute our operating plan. We didn't take shortcuts, we don't compromise, and we teach this mindset to every 1 of our new hires and continually reemphasize it to all of our employees.  In this slide, you will see some of the real proactive steps that we are taking to keep our network running safely. In 2023, we are installing 53 additional hot box detectors across our network. These added detectors will reduce the average spacing from 16.2 miles to 14.9 miles. At CSX, these detectors identify high-bearing temperatures, but also transmit real-time data for trend analysis. So we can not only tell when a bearing is hot and a train needs to stop, but we can also use the data to predict bearings and issues before they reach critical temperatures. We're also continuing to integrate newly hired employees into our safety culture, which begins on day 1. Newly hired employees attend extensive training at our railroad Education and Development Institute in Atlanta. The robust classroom, combined with field-based training gives these new employees the tools they need to operate safely in their new roles. Autonomous track assessment cars, commonly called ATACs, are also used as part of our proactive safety plan. These look and run like regular box cars that are loaded with advanced technology. These cars operate on our regular trains and gather critical inspection data that allow us to closely monitor track conditions. Lastly, we are committed to being supportive partners in the communities in which we live and operate. That is why we dedicate so much effort to developing relationships with first responders in those communities and teaching them how to properly respond to incidents, especially those with hazmat materials. We have a dedicated fleet of railcars, including 4 tank cars that are specifically designed and used to offer multi-day training sessions. This is a program we have run for many years. And in 2022, we trained nearly 4,000 first responders. Turning to the next slide. The FRA personal injury rate ticked down sequentially, while the FRA train accident rate increased slightly. However, both measures are up year-over-year.  It's important to consider that because of the success of our recent hiring efforts, we have a higher percentage of newer employees -- as they gain experience and learn from federal railroaders, we are confident that the frequency of these incidents will decline. Now turning to Slide 9. Operating performance has improved significantly. With the appropriate resources in place, we are doing what we do best, effectively executing our operating plan. The team's ability to deliver these operating results is a true testament to the tough and hard work that we are doing as an operating team and a plan that shows no other than what we can do here at CSX.  Most importantly, the dedication that's given by all of our railroaders. I cannot thank our operating employees enough for overcoming the resource challenges and delivering such solid performance for our customers. Carload trip performance of 86% reached an all-time record level this quarter. while intermodal trip plan performance of 96% matched a record high, while the team is pleased with these results, we'll keep improving. In fact, both measures have continued to improve sequentially into the second quarter. I'm happy with the compliments and support we have received from customers regulators and shareholders on our service improvement, but we are not done yet. As Joe said, our goal is to keep improving our service and show that we can sustain this over time so that we can drive long-term growth for CSX. With that, I will turn it over to Kevin to discuss the top line results. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Jamie. We are very pleased with our merchandise performance this quarter. Revenue increased 13%, benefiting from an 8% increase in revenue per unit and a 4% increase in volume. We are seeing some encouraging signs as customers start to respond to our improved service and reduced cycle times. The team is focused on combining best-in-class service with creative solutions to identify new growth opportunities and gain wallet share with existing customers. While we did see positive growth in automotive, customer production issues impacted volumes in the quarter.  On the positive side, we see production issues moderating and expect a strong outlook for automotive volumes through the remainder of the year. Minerals and Metals both outperformed, driven largely by very strong aggregates in steel demand. Pricing was up year-over-year as we benefited from favorable contract repricing and higher fuel surcharge. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to see benefits from a supportive pricing environment and improved rail service. While the economic outlook remains uncertain, we continue to see positive momentum in many of our merchandise segments as the team focuses on the growth drivers that we can control.  It's still early but we are encouraged by our ability to convert improved service into new business wins in segments such as auto, minerals and food products. There remains a significant opportunity to win share from truck across our merchandise portfolio. Turning to Slide 12. First quarter coal revenue increased 19% on 19% higher volume and flat revenue per unit. Export volumes were strong as we leverage improved cycle times and improved production and performance at the origin mines. We also benefited as we lap the effects of reduced capacity at our Curtis Bay terminal.  Our domestic shipments also improved on utility restocking demand and improved rail capacity. International met coal benchmarks remained strong over the quarter and now sits just below $300 per metric ton, which continues to support strong production levels. Looking ahead, the international coal market continues to be supported by healthy commodity prices that should drive positive year-over-year volume growth through the remainder of the year. While the domestic market could face a more challenging backdrop should natural gas prices remain low.  Turning to intermodal on Slide 13. First quarter revenue decreased by 5% as a 9% decrease in volume more than offset a 5% increase in revenue per unit. Most of this volume decline was due to weakness in international intermodal markets, which, as we expected, have been heavily affected by slowing import activity as demand softened and retail inventories remained elevated. Looking forward, while the intermodal market currently remains challenged, we do expect second half year-over-year headwinds to moderate. The team has a number of initiatives underway to continue to drive truck conversion by introducing new lanes of service where there is market demand.  Now finally, turning to Slide 14. Many of you are aware of the major market shift developing over the last few years as more companies look to diversify their supply chain and bring capacity closer to their key end markets. We have been encouraged by the acceleration in activity with manufacturers of all times, announcing plans and committing capital to build capacity in the Eastern U.S.  For CSX, this represents a great opportunity. Our network connects the major population centers of the Northeast with the fast-growing areas of the Southeast that are highly attractive for companies looking to expand. The mission of our industrial development team is to partner with these companies and provide them with a rail serve location where they can leverage the benefits of the CSX network and industry-leading service. We continue to invest in our select site program that has expanded to include a wider range of rail serve site opportunities.  Combined with new technology enhancements, this will allow us to capture industrial projects of all sizes by offering shovel-ready development sites with access to CSX network. As you can see on the slide, we are excited about the success we are seeing. In 2022 alone, our customer partners brought nearly 90 new facilities online, representing $8.2 billion of total investment across our network and on our short line partners. The map shows how broadly these in-service projects stretch across our service area. Our pipeline remains robust with over 500 projects in process across our entire industrial development pipeline, and we're adding to this total each month.  Over time, we expect the new business that these projects represent to be a key driver to our growth algorithm as we help our partners bring in an increasing number of expansion projects onto our network, driving volumes and revenue higher. I would like to thank the entire team for all of their efforts across our growth initiatives. We're very excited about the momentum we are building and the engagement as we partner with our customers to grow together. Now I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss the financials. Sean Pelkey : Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. Looking at the first quarter results, revenue increased 9% or $300 million on merchandise and coal volume growth, strong pricing and higher fuel recovery. Operating income was up 14% to $1.5 billion as top line growth outpaced several expense headwinds, which I'll discuss in more detail on the following slide. Interest and other expense was $7 million higher compared to the prior year and income tax expense increased by $47 million on higher pretax earnings. Net earnings increased 15% to $1 billion, while EPS grew 23%. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses.  Total first quarter expense increased $111 million compared to the prior year. This includes about $65 million of inflation headwinds as well as an $85 million impact from higher fuel and depreciation combined with lower real estate gains. Now turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe expense increased $31 million as the impacts of additional head count and inflation were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. PS&O expense increased $13 million primarily due to inflation, the inclusion of Pan Am operations and scheduled locomotive overhauls.  These impacts were partially offset by a $46 million benefit due to an insurance recovery arising from a customer facility outage several years ago as well as lower intermodal costs as congestion eases. There were also several smaller line item impacts within PS&O that were greater than expected this quarter and should improve sequentially. Depreciation was up $33 million as a result of last year's equipment study as well as a larger asset base. And fuel expense also increased by $33 million due to a higher gallon price and a 3% increase in gross ton miles.  Equipment and rents improved by $18 million, benefiting from increased fluidity and faster car higher days per load across all markets. Property gains were $19 million unfavorable in the quarter due primarily to lapping prior year gains from the Virginia real estate transaction. Network and congestion related savings were evident within rents and across intermodal terminal expenses this quarter, and we expect sustained network performance to drive further efficiency savings through the year. Now turning to cash flow on Slide 18. CSX generated over $800 million of free cash flow in the quarter. reflecting the impact of cash payments for retroactive wages and bonuses paid to union employees. Adding back these payments, free cash flow would have been up slightly versus last year despite higher investments in the business. You'll also recall that CSX has introduced a measure of economic profit called CSX Cash earnings, or CCE, within our long-term incentive compensation. It benefits both our shareholders and the general public when we grow profitably by encouraging the conversion of freight off the highway.  And CCE is aligned with this shared interest by encouraging disciplined high-return capital investments. The calculation can be seen in the appendix. And through Q1, CCE is up $165 million versus the prior year. After fully funding infrastructure investments and strategic projects, CSX returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the first quarter, including close to $1.1 billion of share repurchases and over $200 million in dividends. Looking forward, we will remain balanced and opportunistic in our approach to returning excess cash to our shareholders. And with that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. Joseph Hinrichs : Thank you. Thank you, Sean. Now let's conclude with some comments on our outlook for 2023, as shown on Slide 20. First, as you heard Kevin describe, we are very pleased with the performance we have seen year-to-date from our merchandise business. Strong demand for grains, metals, Minerals and Automotive, combined with significant new customer wins give us increasing confidence that we will be able to deliver solid volume growth for the year in merchandise. We're also off to a strong start to the year for coal, and we expect continued benefit from healthy export demand, both thermal and met. Our merchandise and coal have met or exceeded our expectations. Intermodal volumes have been below what we anticipated. We knew the intermodal -- sorry, we knew the international intermodal activity will be down substantially over the first half of the year. And though parts of our domestic business are doing very well, has not been enough to offset the effect of lower imports and elevated inventory.  Altogether, Intermodal contributes less than 1/3 of our revenues, but it does contribute roughly half of our volume and was a drag on our total volume over the quarter. The softer intermodal performance will make it difficult for our total CSX volume to meet our previous guidance and grow faster than GDP, especially as consensus GDP estimates for 2023 have moved up and are currently at 1.1%. That said, the effect on our business mix is favorable. Revenue ton miles grew by a solid 4% in the first quarter, driven by the strength in merchandise and export coal and we expect revenue ton miles to grow solidly in the low single digits for the full year. The rest of our outlook is consistent with what we told you at the beginning of the year.  We continue to benefit from the favorable pricing environment with customer negotiations supported by our transparency on costs and our improved service products. We still expect supplemental revenues to decline by roughly $300 million compared to last year, with much of that decline in run rate already in [indiscernible] in the first quarter. International met coal benchmarks remained very strong over the quarter and spot prices are just below $300 per tonne today, but year-over-year comparisons will get tougher from here. We will continue our efforts to drive higher efficiency and reduce excess costs to counter the inflationary effects in our labor and other operating costs as best we can. So -- the best way for us to support our margin performance will be to drive more merchandise volume and benefit from the powerful operating leverage potential of our network.  Lastly, we still estimate cash flow expenditures at $2.3 billion. In closing, I am very encouraged by what we accomplished in this quarter. I'm energized to see the ONE CSX culture start to take shape across this company. Every industry has challenges, but ours are addressable and solvable, and I am confident that they are far outweighed by the opportunities that we have ahead. As I said before, all of us here at every location across our network share a common goal of providing the safe, reliable service to our customers that drives profitable growth, and we are taking meaningful steps towards that goal. Thank you, and we'll now take your questions. Matthew Korn : Thank you, Joe. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, operator, please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Brian Ossenbeck : Kevin, with the backdrop of improving service and bidding compliance at pretty strong levels. Can you just talk about the order rates, the fill rates across the network? You've heard some different comments and clearly, intermodal is suffering from poor bid compliance. But where do you see when you talk to your customers across the different networks, I guess, primarily within merchandise, where it might be a little more service and truck sensitive. Kevin Boone : Yes. I think you probably remember the discussion over the last few quarters where we said we weren't up against the order rates. I would say we're probably more in line with that, especially with our improved service levels. So we're meeting the customer demand currently, but we did see weakness kind of starting last year during the third quarter, fourth quarter period. So as we look through the back half of the year, in many of our markets, particularly on the merchandise side, we see -- we should see some easier comparisons based on the current economic activity that we're seeing. So that's what gives us kind of the confidence in the guidance as we move through the year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Kenneth Hoexter : Great. If I could just follow on that thought there, Kevin. So it seems like something changed economically kind of mid-February, right, if we look at spot rates in trucking. Can you talk about -- I don't know, Joe, you seem to be talking about kind of intermodal being tougher, and that's why switching from a GDP plus to a kind of an RTM type of outlook. Is there something changing economically in the backdrop more recently? Or is that just the weakness in the truck market? Maybe just talk a little bit about on the intermodal side or just the economic background. Kevin Boone : Yes, I think -- and we certainly expected a weak market on the international side, but it's safe to say that I think that market came in a bit weaker than what we had expected in the first quarter. But on the flip side, and I would probably make this trade off every time as we saw some strength in some of the merchandise markets that obviously have a much higher ARPU and revenue contribution. So -- that's kind of what we saw through the quarter. There are varying opinions on when the international market will recover. Some of our larger customers expect some kind of pickup in the second half. We have seen some stability over the last 2 to 3 weeks, which is encouraging, but we'll face difficult comparisons through the third quarter and then fourth quarter gets a lot easier. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Jonathan Chappell : Kevin, I'm going to stick with you. Given the slides that Jamie put up, particularly number 9, with all those service improvements, Trip plan performance, et cetera, do you feel like you're being appropriately compensated for your improved service, both on an absolute basis, but especially on a relative basis as you go through these contract renewals. And I guess another way to ask that is, how far are you through the contract renewals that actually exemplify some of the service improvements that you've done over the last couple of months? Kevin Boone : Yes. Typically, when you look at our renewal rates, and we renew a little over half our business every year, and that's highly concentrated in the fourth and first quarters. And I would say, given the backdrop in inflation that we would certainly we're having those conversations with our customers to be able to cover our cost increases that are very visible to the market. As we continue to prove our service, customers continue to reiterate, they're willing to pay for the service and the reliability that we can provide. And the plan is, and we -- I think that's starting to occur as we believe we have a differentiated service in the market.  And so it's -- we're starting to see early success in our conversations with customers around more volume opportunities with them. And I can't reiterate enough in a market like this is where we should be taking share. Our customers are looking for ways to save money. Usually, rail is a cheaper option for them, and they're getting more and more confidence in our ability to deliver the service that we need to. So the team is very, very excited about some of the things that we've been able to do here over the last few months. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : And maybe this is for Joe or Jamie, but we've had, obviously, a lot of negative press on the railroads, unfortunately, in the last few months. And the PSR concept has kind of been dragged through the mud a bit. But can you guys compare and contrast because you are delivering just like the last question, very good service metrics here. So what's driving the difference between the rest of the industry? And I guess, how do you leverage that going forward. . Joseph Hinrichs : Yes, thanks. I'll start and let Jamie add some comments. As I've said many times in the past, I think the guiding principles of our operating model are long-standing and are sustainable, and that, of course, improves safety control costs. Improve asset utilization, improve the employee experience and then also improve customer service, and we are working hard at all 5 of those and keeping them in balance as far as how we prioritize for always safety first.  And I believe very strongly that the results that we're seeing throughout our network and being delivered by our great ONE CSX team is a result of that and focusing on our employees and the customer service specifically. And so I believe that the principles of [indiscernible] railroading are just as valid today as they were 5 years ago. Obviously, it's how you keep things in balance and how you prioritize and how you bring everyone along and we're trying to lead by example in that regard. Jamie Boychuk : Well, Joe hit it really well. For -- when I think about -- and I hear people say PSR, what does that really mean? I don't know. I only know one way to railroad. And this is the way I was taught the railroad many years ago back when I was at CN. So we've been able to teach the great folks at CSX over the past 6 years how to do this. I've got an unbelievable operating team, some great bench strength and we are doing fantastic, and we've got the resources in place in order to now actually operate the plan. We struggled for years to do that through COVID, but we've come out of it the way we said we would.  And we're operating the plant and the team that's out there that's exercising that in the field, not just the network folks who put the plan together, but the field team who is executing it and the folks on the [indiscernible] line who are running the trains each and every day that are doing an unbelievable job are getting the trains from point A to Z the way we need them to and servicing the customers the way that we've committed to servicing them and giving Kevin and his team a product that gives them an opportunity to finally go out there and sell something that's different. So I don't know, call it what you want. I just call it railroading. Operator : We'll take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Kevin, how should we be thinking about rev per carload in sequentially even from 1Q, 2Q. Just maybe walk us through some of the puts and takes. And then similar things, Sean, just 60.5% OR in Q1. I know there's the insurance recovery, but do you think we see sequential improvement from here the rest of the year. Kevin Boone : Yes. I think really the biggest driver from Q1 to Q2, we continue to, as I said, see strong pricing in the backdrop of higher inflation and that's not going to -- that's going to continue throughout the year as we obviously have contract renewals, and we'll have those discussions with customers.  The biggest swing factor, quite frankly, is fuel surcharge and where you see diesel prices head into the summer here. And on a year-over-year basis, where they sit right now, obviously, that's an optical headwind, but we know how quickly those can recover, and so we'll see where that trends. But other than that, you look at export coal and sequentially, probably ex fuel, you're probably looking at something that's flat to the first quarter on the coal RPU, which can swing around a little bit, and that's one that you usually ask about. But otherwise, positive momentum on the core price and then we'll just have to wait and see where the diesel prices shake out. Sean Pelkey : And then, Scott, in terms of operating ratio, yes, I mean, 60.5% for the first quarter is obviously a great start for us. I think as you think about sequentially, you probably have to normalize that for both the insurance gain and then the favorable fuel lag benefit that we had in the quarter. So that gets you to around a 62.5%. We almost always do better in the second quarter from an OR perspective than the first, and that's primarily as a result of the fact that volumes typically seasonally increase in Q2 relative to Q1. We don't see any reason to believe that we'll see anything different this year.  Particularly with some of the issues we had in Q1 with auto production that should ease here, have eased and a strong demand for aggregate. So it's a good setup. I will say just one thing to caveat that with is other revenue was a little bit elevated in Q1 versus the run rate where it likely will be the rest of the year, that may be a little bit of a headwind, but on the flip side, we feel good about the cost momentum if service continues to be at these levels or even better, we should see more costs come out sequentially. Operator : We'll take our next question from Fadi Chamoun with BMO. Fadi Chamoun : Yes. You had the slide talking about the 19 new facilities coming online and obviously, a very strong pipeline that you've discussed in the past into '24 and '25. But I'm just curious when you talk to existing customers, your existing facilities, are you seeing growth in your share of wallet? If you could give us some examples, some tangible example to kind of appreciate that. Kevin Boone : Yes, Fadi. I think that's directly tied to our service product. And we're in the very early innings of that. I think we've seen some customers more willing to have those conversations and others that are kind of wait and see and want to see more months or even quarters of good performance before they're willing to have that conversation. But we've seen some early success. One example that comes to mind is in our food products category where we've gone from roughly a 60% share with our customer now 90% share and doing some things operationally, thanks to Jamie and his team have provided a really, really good service to them, truck-like service that really benefits them from a cost perspective. And that's a direct truck conversion for us. But I see many, many more of those examples starting to happen.  We're working really diligently with Jamie's team and having [indiscernible] exercises with our customers. which is really thinking through the art of what's possible, putting our network against what their needs are and really figuring out if there's opportunities to grow and how we really convert the truck. I think the customer acceptance on these meetings has been the highest I've ever seen because they're looking for ways to save on costs given the uncertain backdrop on the market. But a lot of momentum -- the team is working really hard. We have a number of these set up over the next few weeks and quarters ahead. And I expect to have a lot of success. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Michael Triano : This is Mike Triano on for Tom. So Trip plan compliance and carload 86 seems to be a level where you can make some good progress on truck conversions. Do you think that there are enough crew resources on the network to maintain a strong service product? Or is there some additional hiring that you have to do from here? Jamie Boychuk : Mike, we've got a good number with respect to our people. We're still working on a -- like to get another 150 to 200 folks as we try to get closer to a 7,400 number, in particular, for vacation peak. We're sitting around 70% to 80%, I think, today, close to 73%. So we want to push towards that. Now remember, attrition is 10%. We've got to continue to stay up against attrition, which also gives us another trigger if something goes the other way, where we could react, as Sean mentioned, with some costs along the way if we needed to. Resource-wise, we definitely have enough locomotives out there. As a matter of fact, the faster we get the more fluid we get, we need less locomotives.  So we'll continue to analyze those resources and pull them out where we need to, but keep them in a spot where we can use them as Kevin and his team brings more business on we're able to bring them back. And of course, everything that comes back earns its keep. So we'll continue to work those resources. But on the car side, that's a strategy we continue to look at as a team. working with customers. I know Kevin and his team and my team are working close to make sure we've got car supply as we need them as we work with customers and make sure that we have the right resources on that end. At this point in time, we feel good with where we are. But you see the growth that's coming, and Kevin talked about some of those growth areas that are out there. Maybe he wants to touch a little bit on the car side and what he sees in his discussions with customers in those resources. But other than that, -- we're in good shape with everything. Kevin Boone : I think, as Jamie mentioned, Joe got the team together, the sales and marketing team, along with the operations team and Sean's team and we had a lengthy discussion here recently just on what the needs are. And I'm very encouraged of we have a plan to make sure that we can meet the coming demand in some of these markets that we see great growth and whether it's aggregates some of the auto business, where we know that car supply is going to be a differentiating factor where we feel like we have a good plan in place. Operator : We'll take our next question from Justin Long with Stephens. Justin Long : Sean, I think on prior calls, you talked about the elevated level of service-related costs that should moderate this year. During the call in January, I felt like you were suggesting this tailwind would be more second half weighted. But could you share any updated thoughts on the cadence of these cost savings? I'm curious if you saw this materialize in the first quarter and how you're expecting that number to trend in the quarters ahead? Sean Pelkey : Yes. I think we're off to a good start. Like I said, we had about $15 million to $20 million of what I would call congestion related cost savings in the quarter. That was mostly -- you see that clearly on the rents line on a within PS&O related to intermodal terminals. So we are already seeing some of those costs come out, as I mentioned, sequentially into Q2. Our forecast is that we'll see that pick up a little bit. And then as we get to the second half, that's where we'll see the bulk of it, like you mentioned. So -- and that's going to be in -- continue to be improvements in things like rents and intermodal terminals, locomotive maintenance related to the engine count that Jamie talked about, over time and other related crew costs. So -- and then on top of that, we've got other initiatives not just related to cycling some of the congestion issues from last year that we're working on. And of course, volume growth always helps in terms of productivity levels, both our crews and our assets. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Christian Wetherbee : Maybe a question on the headcount side. Jamie, you gave some good near-term color. I guess I'm curious in the context of sort of your progress towards that 7,400 goal. And then reflecting the fact that the volume environment is maybe a little bit more questionable than it was earlier in the year. Is there a point where maybe you hit the pause button on hire and kind of reassess the volume environment? And so after the second quarter, we could see that number potentially moderate depending on the economic conditions we're seeing. Jamie Boychuk : Chris. No, I'm -- listen, we -- I wouldn't say we took the pause button at all. What we've done is this time, I'd say, last quarter when we were talking, we had 550 trainees out there. We're looking to keep ourselves around 350 to 400 trainees as we move forward on a constant basis. So we dropped that number a bit knowing that we don't need to ramp up the way we were. As I said, we look at 10% as our attrition rate. So we still need to ramp up that number a little bit. And then, of course, we'll review a little bit if we need to bring that down to maybe 300 or maybe that 350 is the sweet spot.  We're always looking to reduce our attrition rate. I think in the industry for many, many years, 10% has been that rate. But of course, we're working really hard with our initiatives to see what we can do to get people to stay at the railroad. And if we see those numbers come down, then we'd be looking at our hiring needs obviously drop with that. But we're in a good spot. We're at a much better spot than where we were in the past with those numbers. I feel comfortable. And that's on the T&E side. Of course, we are still doing locomotive engineer training as we move forward.  It's the right thing for us to do, so we don't get ourselves in a situation where we're short on engineers in the future, but we recycle conductors to make engineers. And we're always hiring on our engineering side of the house and mechanical side as we continue to look at that high end on the union side. So our numbers are at a pretty good point. I don't see any large jumps at all. If anything, it's more just maintaining where we're at. And if we need to look at if things really go in a different direction. We know that we've got that 10% attrition rate. We've committed to our T&E folks that we're going to keep them [indiscernible] employed as long as we can through whatever we need to weather any storms. We don't necessarily see any storms ahead of us, but we don't know what the markets show obviously. But if we need to, we can pull that trigger on hiring really quick. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Congrats on the results really impressive. One question I wanted to ask. So if I look at intermodal revenue as a percentage of the total enterprise, it was like 13.5%, which I mean I could be wrong, but I think that's the lowest number at least this decade over the last 10 years. And so I guess I'm trying to understand, you showed good cost leverage the mix was really positive in terms of where that -- where the revenue growth came from. And so I guess I'm just trying to understand what happens to cost ex fuel as some of the intermodal mix normalize as a percentage of revenue. I don't know if you think that's a fair question or not, but it just seems like maybe that has something to do with some of the strong cost leverage. Sean Pelkey : Yes. I mean, Amit, we don't get into sort of specific margins within each line of business. To the extent that intermodal volumes were down, which, of course, they were. You're going to see savings at intermodal terminals. We'll be able to see some savings on our crew starts. We'll have some savings on fuel -- but did that disproportionately impact our margins this year? And would that disproportionately impact them if intermodal or I should say, when intermodal recovers I don't think that's our view. We've got strong incremental margins within every segment of the business. And I think as intermodal -- as those volumes normalize and begin to grow again, it's going to have a positive impact on our operating ratio. Operator : Our next question comes from Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Ariel Rosa : Congrats on a strong quarter here. Kevin, you laid out a pretty exciting pipeline of new business opportunities there. I was hoping you could maybe quantify the impact of that in terms of revenue or earnings and kind of what the time line might look like for realizing whether it's that 500 set of opportunities that you talked about, what that might look like over the next couple of years. Kevin Boone : Yes. I mean when you look at a number of these projects, it's going to take a couple of years, if not 3 years, to really complete some of the auto facilities that we're seeing, some of the -- on the metal side as well. So really, I think the momentum builds into 2025. aspirationally, if you ask me, it's kind of 1 to 2 points of growth that we would aspire to on a gross basis. Now sometimes some of these can cannibalize a little bit of your business, but I would like to be able to gross up a point, if not a little bit more, just from the industrial development side, given all the activity that we have as we really start to hit our stride and these projects come online. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ben Nolan with Stifel. Benjamin Nolan : Actually, Kevin, I might follow up there because it is -- it's a nice list, nice map. I'm curious, as you look at that and you're competing for those projects. How much of that is competing against another rail versus actual head-to-head against trucks? Or how should we think about where the competition lies for that growth? Kevin Boone : Well, as you know, over the last 40, 50 years, the railroads haven't done a great job of attracting new industrial development to the railroad. So it's all about getting the word out. It's all getting investing in our team, making sure that companies understand the advantages particularly some of these new markets, when you think about battery production that is very, very new to the United States, and they need to -- they're not familiar with necessarily rail infrastructure and what we can offer. So A lot of the exciting emerging markets, that's where you have to be out in front of it and make sure that you have -- you offer the locations, the infrastructure, the energy resources that they need in order to move quickly.  And it's all about having shovel-ready opportunities that touch the railroad, which you can develop quickly. And the market is moving way quicker than it ever has. And so that's why it's key to have these industrial sites ready for those customers to go. We compete every day with our eastern peer as well. And certainly, we're learning -- leaning into the service that we can provide. We touch a lot of other good industrial companies that they want to reach. And so those all things are factors in our selling points to the customers as they make these decisions. Operator : Take our next question from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : This is Andre filling in for Jordan. I just wanted to sort of follow up on the fuel piece. It looks like fuel surcharge revenue was up $121 million year-over-year, but fuel expense was only up $33 million. So the net of the 2 is an $88 million benefit to EBIT in the first quarter. I think that benefit was more like $63 million in the fourth quarter. So some acceleration here on the fuel benefit. Any expectation for, I guess, how that trends in terms of timing or magnitude, It just -- or it seems like based on the diesel strips, you might see some benefit in the second quarter still and maybe drop in the third quarter. You just sort of curious in your thoughts here and what offsets there might be. Sean Pelkey : Thanks, Andre. This is Sean. Your math is correct. I think if you look into the second quarter and you're looking on a sequential basis, at least where fuel prices are and where the forward curve is, it will be a net drag. I would put it in the category of $50 million plus versus the first quarter on a net basis. That's the impact to both revenue and expense. But I think what you were talking about is relative to last year, in the second quarter, it will be likely a net benefit just simply because last year in the second quarter, fuel prices were going up, and we reported a negative lag in the fuel surcharge program. So we'll be cycling that, assuming no change to diesel prices versus where they are right now. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Sean, can you talk a little bit about expectations for average cost per hedge kind of on a year-over-year basis and add any color to how much the CTO that's been added into the benefit packages is impacting cost for full year '23? Sean Pelkey : Absolutely, David. So on cost per employee, I think we came in right about where we expected. Maybe a little bit favorable just due to mix impact of employees with the driver count at quality, which are a little less in terms of dollars per employee -- as you go to Q2, I think it will be fairly stable versus Q1, maybe up a little bit depending on that employee mix. And then as we get into the second half of the year, you will see a step-up just due to the timing of the wage increases for the union employees, which is scheduled to be a 4% increase -- in terms of the cost of the , which we've now got agreements with about 10,000 of our union employees -- we are -- we have added those costs into the forecast.  The experience so far has been very positive. We are seeing the employees take advantage of the benefit, and we are seeing when that's needed. There's a little bit of additional overtime, but there are some benefits to it as well and certainly quality of life is 1 of those benefits. And on a net basis, I would say, a couple of million a quarter at this point. Operator : We'll take our next question from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak : Just going back to the share gain piece of it. Merchandise volume, you grew 4%. Is there any way to quantify or give us some perspective of what those share gains were this quarter, if any? And as we think about that spread over what the market is growing in those areas, is that 1% to 2% on top of that a pretty good guide. And would that be more of '24 for this? Or do you think you can get there in '23? Kevin Boone : Yes. I think a lot of the success that we had in -- particularly on the merchandise side is really the service improvement that we saw. And our ability to capture the orders that our customers have. And so that January, February were really good months, weather probably was a little bit favorable in those months as well that then certainly help us, but then Jamie would tell me, March was pretty challenging from a weather perspective. So I would say overall, normal weather through the quarter, probably a little better in January, February. But it really is about just a service recovery and our ability on a year-over-year basis to capture more of the demand that was out there even though we've seen a little bit of softness in some markets. Operator : We'll take our next question from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital. Walter Spracklin : So I want to turn it back to Sean for a moment here. And really just related back to Jamie and Joe's comments. I mean -- and even Kevin. So Jamie has a pretty good handle on operations here. The model is working very well. Kevin is translating it into business wins and good growth opportunities. And then Joe in his outlook mentioned that asset productivity is going to exceed or approach prior record levels. when I go back and look at prior record levels, that's the time when you were hitting kind of the low 58 OR. Is that a good -- I mean is that overly simplistic to say that when you're hitting those kind of record operating record asset productivity levels that you can't achieve those type of ORs in 2023? Or is it a little too simplistic, Sean, to look at it that way? Sean Pelkey : Well, Walter, I think you think back to the 58 OR, the first thing you've got to recognize is the quality acquisitions since then. So that's about 250 basis points of headwind. And we've had a lot of inflation. We're paying employees more. The underlying cost of contractors and materials is higher. And so those are headwinds. That being said, as we continue to run the business well and we deliver good productivity, and we get great feedback from the customers. We've got this pipeline of wins that are setting up as well as delivering against customer expectations and demands. We're going to deliver that at strong incremental margins, and that's going to help out over the medium to long term on the OR. I can't give you a specific point destination. But as we go forward, we would expect improvement from where we are right now. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason Seidl with Cowen. Jason Seidl : Congrats on the good quarter. It's really nice to see the service doing so well here, and that was reflected, I think, in our survey that we did this quarter. I wanted to talk about your outlook and sort of what's baked in with an assumption on the West Coast ports sort of coming to a labor agreement. Are you looking for some of that East Coast volumes to shift back? And if so, how do you think it will affect operations? Kevin Boone : From that perspective, I don't see a huge amount of shift. You're going to continue to see you a secular advantage of the East Coast, and there's a lot of investment going on, as you know, in Savannah and other ports on the network. Quite frankly, the challenges on the West Coast have heard our intermodal business, when you think of what wants to come across through California through Chicago onto our network. So I view that as probably an incremental positive for us that some of that freight will see through the interchange with some of our Western partners out there. So that's a positive outcome in my mind in terms of our growth opportunity as we move into the back half. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to today\u2019s speaker Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Matthew Korn : Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In the presentation accompanying this call, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on slide two followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on slide three. And with that, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs. Joe Hinrichs : Thank you, Matthew, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call. Our performance over the second quarter met our expectations led by the strong results of our merchandise business. As we had indicated at year-end and again last quarter, we knew that we would have to manage through lower intermodal storage revenue and normalizing export coal prices. We expect the intermodal volume to be soft as imports slowed and destocking activity continued. That said, we also knew that we were gaining momentum with our customers, led by our improved service performance and in our own workplace as our ONE CSX efforts took hold. Our network continues to run well, and our company's initiatives combined with our employees' hard work and commitment to making a big difference and helping to set our railroad apart. There was much more to do, but our results this quarter show signs of the progress we are making as we lay the groundwork for long-term growth and value-creation. Turning to slide five. Let's review the highlights for the second quarter. We moved over 1.5 million carloads in the second quarter, led by a 3% volume growth in merchandise and 4% growth in coal, and our margins remained strong with an operating ratio below 60%, including the impact of the Quality Carriers' trucking business. We generated $3.7 billion in revenue, which was 3% lower than the previous year and flat from the first quarter. Operating income decreased 13% year-over-year to $1.5 billion and our earnings per share decreased by 9% to $0.49. When making comparisons to last year, it's important to remember that our second quarter 2022 results included a $122 million gain, representing $0.04 per share of EPS related to the Commonwealth of Virginia property sale. All in, this was a solid performance highlighted by great results in our core business. The fact that our team was able to drive 3% merchandise volume growth in such an uncertain macroeconomic market is a testament to what we are able to do when we work together. Now moving on to slide six. Earlier this month, CSX released its new 2022 ESG report, which highlights the tremendous progress that our team has made in moving our company forward. Since I started here last fall, you've heard me talk about ONE CSX, about building a supportive and positive culture and about the need to consider all of our stakeholders who are measuring our success as a company. Many of you have asked me, what this really means in practice. What does the railroad look like where its people feel valued and included, where its customers feel appreciated, and where the communities in which it operates you are respected? I think the picture and the highlight that you see here offer a small view into how we're making this happen here at CSX. To us, incorporating environmental, social and governance considerations into the priorities of our company goes hand-in-hand with our ONE CSX focus. Adding to the greater sense of purpose that we all share. These are real, authentic actions that we're taking today. We talk often about our environmental leadership and our clear advantage here over trucks as a core part of our value proposition to our customers and our shareholders. By expanding our use of technology, conducting practical testing of alternative fuels and offering support and encouragement to our suppliers, we continue to make progress. As we reported in our press release last week, we are testing biodiesel blends in locomotives in revenue service. Last month, you heard that we are in talks with CPKC to form a joint venture for the development of hydrogen-powered locomotives, which offer encouraging promise as a low emissions fuel solution. What we probably do not talk enough about are all the incredible efforts made by our railroaders, to build up the places in which we live and work. It's been a priority of ours to increase our company's positive cultural impact. And I am proud of how quickly the people in CSX have responded. As you see here, our volunteer hours are up substantially. Our CSX-sponsored community events have multiplied. And the number of people who we have been able to help and support has been incredible. I look forward to much more to come. There's one last item I'd like to mention. At CSX, safety is our top priority, and that's why we focus so much on our reported injury and accident rates. Our fundamental goal is to make sure that every one of our employees gets home safely every day. When that does not happen and we lose one of our colleagues as we lost Derek Little last month, it affects us deeply. As a reminder, why we make so much effort on safety and how much more work we need to do. Now let me turn it over to the team. Jamie Boychuk : Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. As Joe just said, we continue to make every effort to enhance our company's safety performance. As slide eight shows, we made good progress this quarter with both our FRA injury frequency and FRA train accident rate improving sequentially. Our injury rate also improved year-over-year and was the lowest rate for a second quarter that we've seen since 2015. Our focus is to ensure that every employee, including new hires who are less familiar, understands and appreciates their part to reinforce our safety-focused culture. Turning to slide nine. Our operating performance held up well over the second quarter and continues to lead the industry. Thanks to the hard work of our railroaders, who execute the operating plan every day. I've seen firsthand the positive response to the efforts being made by our employees to strengthen our culture. Our men and women in the field are valued, included, respected, appreciated and listen to, which helps them feel even more pride in the service they are delivering to our customers. Because of them, we're able to show how well our scheduled railroading model works, and I am excited as there are more opportunities ahead. Velocity averaged 17.7 miles per hour in the second quarter, slightly lower than last quarter, but up substantially from the same period in 2022. Dwell averaged 9.3 hours, an improvement of over 20%, compared to the same period last year. Intermodal trip plan performance of 96%, increased by 6 percentage points year-over-year, while carload trip plan performance of 84% improved by 25 percentage points. I'm pleased with the compliments and support we have received from our customers, regulators, and shareholders on our service improvements. Our goal is to keep improving our service and show that we can continue to sustain this over time so we can drive long-term growth for CSX. With that, I will turn it over to Kevin to discuss our sales and marketing performance. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Jamie. As Joe noted, despite headwinds across many of our markets, the team was able to capitalize on strong year-over-year improvement in service. Importantly, as service has improved, there\u2019s opening up opportunities to discuss new business with our customers where we are seeing in our year-to-date pipeline up 30%. I'm proud of the team and the progress we have made. There remains a lot of work ahead of us as we focus on building our pipeline of growth opportunities. Initiatives including whiteboarding sessions with customers, increasing direct engagement with small and medium-sized shippers, bringing new technology tools to better serve our customers and finally, expanding our reach by leveraging our transload network and collaborating with both with our short-line and Class 1 partners are just a few of the focus areas for the team as we move into the back half of the year. Turning to slide 11. Our strong merchandise performance continued into the second quarter, with revenue increasing 5% even as our fuel surcharge declined substantially on lower diesel prices. This growth was driven by 3% higher volume, compared to last year and a 1% all-in increase in revenue per unit. As we saw in the first quarter, our customers are seeing improved service levels, which is opening up opportunities and encouraging them to bring more of their business to our network. For the quarter, we saw many of the market trends continue from the start of the year. In automotive, we are seeing more consistent production and we've seen our improved service lead to new opportunities and business wins. Minerals benefited from strong construction demand for aggregates in our improving cycle times. And our metals and equipment business continues to be a bright spot, with volumes up across steel, scrap, and equipment. We've been successful in expanding our commercial relationships and translating our service product and to convert new business wins. I'm also pleased that our fertilizer business delivered higher volumes year-over-year, supported by strong domestic shipments of potash and nitrogen. On the other side, chemicals continues to be soft as demand remains challenged across our broad book of business. Forest products. [Technical Difficulty] products faces headwinds in paper and pulpboard. We've also seen some slowdown in export grains for ag and food. For the second-half of the year, we expect to build on the successes we've had to win more wallet share of our existing customers, while continuing our efforts to attract new customers away from truck. We expect auto, minerals, and metals markets to remain supportive and will be important contributors to volume growth over the remainder of 2023. We look for destocking activity to wind down in many of the markets we serve including chemicals, so timing there remains uncertain. What's most important is that our team is not sitting back and waiting for markets to turn. We are pushing forward with our own initiatives. Our business development group has been making great progress with our Select Site program and expanding our pipeline of partner projects. And we're strategically investing in developing new locations, providing additional transloading capabilities and investing in railcars to drive more business to CSX. Turning to slide 12. Second quarter coal revenue decreased 2% as a 4% volume gain was more than offset by a 6% decline in revenue per unit, driven by lower export coal benchmarks. We saw continued growth in export volumes due to beneficial cycle times, good performance at our Curtis Bay terminal and a push among our coal customers to move more tonnage into the overseas markets. Domestic utility shipments declined as we expected, as low natural gas prices weighed on coal burn. Though demand in Southern utilities remained favorable. We expect momentum in the export markets to continue over the second-half of the year, with CSX volume supported by new mine capacity and coal producers making opportunistic shipments into the international markets. On the domestic side, we see tougher comparisons versus a strong second-half last year. But the hot summer is providing a helpful tailwind early in this quarter and just recently we are seeing a few customers looking for additional sets. Of course, as international pricing benchmarks have eased from last year's record highs, we will see an impact on our revenue per unit into the third quarter. Most of our exports are met coal with the benchmark around $225 per metric ton. We anticipate our third quarter all-in coal RPU will sequentially decline by a mid-teens percentage. Current international benchmark prices remained very healthy and supportive of strong production into the back half of the year. Now turning to slide 13. Second quarter revenue decreased by 18% due to a 10% decline in volume and a 9% reduction in revenue per unit, reflecting the effect of lower fuel surcharge. As in the first quarter, international intermodal drove most of the volume decrease with the business seeing headwinds from declining imports and inventory destocking. Volumes in the domestic business showed a much more modest decline [Technical Difficulty] by the good progress we continue to make with rail conversions and the team's efforts to identify new markets and lanes. Our best-in-class Eastern service product continues to position us for truck conversion in the quarters and years ahead. Looking forward, while we and our customers are still looking for a rebound in the international business, pressing ahead with our own initiatives, we brought on a new shipper late in the quarter that recognize the value of our strong service product. And we're seeing other opportunities in new lanes, growing activity at inland ports. Domestically, we're encouraged by many opportunities to work more closely with all of our Class 1 partners to target truck conversion. Just one example of this is the agreement we reached with CPKC just a few weeks ago to create a new interchange in Alabama that will link our customers across the Southeast with key markets in Texas and Mexico. We think there's much more opportunities for new creative partnerships that can help bring even more business to all of the railroads. And we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Now I will turn it over to Sean to discuss the financials. Sean Pelkey : Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. Looking at the second quarter results, revenue was lower by 3% or $116 million, declines in fuel recovery, other revenue, and benchmark-based export coal pricing [Technical Difficulty] benefits from strong merchandise pricing, as well as volume growth across merchandise and export coal. Operating income was down 13% to $1.5 billion, reflecting a $122 million headwind from cycling a gain on the Virginia property transaction. I'll discuss the expense line items in more detail on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $25 million higher compared to the prior year, and income tax expense decreased by $64 million on lower pre-tax earnings. As a result, EPS fell by $0.05, reflecting a $0.04 impact of lower property gains. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. Total second quarter expense increased $105 million. Lower fuel price was largely offset by the prior year Virginia gain. While network efficiency improvements resulted in over $20 million of cost savings across labor, PS&O, and rents, it was not enough to overcome more than $100 million of headwinds from inflation and higher depreciation. Turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe expense increased $57 million, impacted by inflation and increased headcount. Importantly, service improvements are helping us get more employees home sooner, with overtime ratios down nearly 10% and a significant reduction in the number of employees tuck away from home over 24 hours. As a reminder mid-year union wage rates stepped-up by 4% on July 1, and will be reflected in our second half cost per employee. PS&O expense increased $37 million with inflation and higher repair and maintenance expense, partly offset by savings in intermodal operations and cycling of costs related to the Pan Am acquisition. While we are overhauling and rebuilding more engines than last year, locomotive efficiency was 4% improved in the quarter. Depreciation was up $33 million as a result of last year's equipment study, as well as a larger asset base. Fuel cost was down $134 million driven by lower gallon price. Equipment and rents was $5 million favorable, reflecting strong improvement in car cycle times with merchandise cycles 13% better than last year. These efficiency gains more than offset costs from inflation and higher volume, particularly in the automotive market. Finally, as discussed, property gains were $117 million unfavorable in the quarter. Now turning to cash flow and distributions on slide 17. After fully funding infrastructure investments and strategic projects, CSX has generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. This has supported $2.4 billion in shareholder returns, including over $1.9 billion in share repurchases and $450 million of dividends. We were encouraged to receive recent news of a credit ratings upgrade. This move reflects the strong core cash-generating power of CSX through economic cycles, which supports our ongoing commitment to investing in the business and our balanced opportunistic approach to capital return. Economic profit, as measured by CSX cash earnings, is up over $80 million year-to-date. While intermodal storage revenue declines in export coal headwinds we\u2019ll have a more significant year-over-year impact in the second-half, we remain committed to cultivating and investing in return-seeking projects that see the pipeline of mid and long-term growth and efficiency gains. With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. Joe Hinrichs : Alright. Thank you, Sean. Now let's conclude with some comments on our outlook for 2023 as shown on slide 19. First, we reiterate our expectation that revenue ton miles will grow in the low-single digits for the full-year. We remain very happy with the performance of our merchandise business through the first-half of the year and we look for volumes to be supported by continued strength in automotive, minerals and metals and the successes we've had in the marketplace. We expect full-year coal volumes to be higher, driven by strong demand for export coal. As we noted last quarter, domestic coal shipments will likely soften as demand is impacted by low natural gas prices. For intermodal, as Kevin said earlier, we have seen modest signs of improvement for domestic intermodal activity starting late in the second quarter, but there are no signs yet of a near-term recovery for the international business. We're still benefiting from a favorable pricing environment, though our expectation for $300 million decline in supplemental revenues is unchanged, with most of that year-over-year reduction occurring in the second-half of the year. Lower international met coal benchmark prices will also impact our coal revenue per unit over the remainder of the year. As before, we are making our best efforts to drive efficiency and control costs to offset real inflationary pressures, and we are committed to staying focused on improving service to our customers. And finally, we still estimate capital expenditures at $2.3 billion with a strong focus on innovation and growth. To sum up, I am proud of the progress that the ONE CSX team continues to make. There is no doubt that we face some mixed economic conditions in the near-term. However, there are so many opportunities opening up for us to win share, expand our markets and achieve profitable growth if we remain focused on safety, service, execution and working together. I am very excited about what is ahead for CSX. Thank you, and we'll now take your questions. Matthew Korn : Thank you, Joe. We will now move to our question-and-answer session. In the interest of time and to make sure that everyone has an opportunity, we ask you to all please limit yourselves to one and only one question. Emma, we're ready to start the process. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Joe, I guess maybe wanted to start with some thoughts on how you -- the second-half of the year I guess, and in particular, how you think about matching resources to the volume and revenue environment that we're in right now, as you noted you have coal, and you have other revenue headwinds that are greater on a year-over-year basis as we move into the back half of the year. Certainly, volume is still like it's a little bit uncertain, Joe, as you mentioned around the economic outlook. So how do we think about sort of managing the resources? I know service is coming back. Is it time that headcount starts to decelerate on a sequential basis? Do you think that there is more work to be done there? And conceptually, how you think about that fits in and what it may be means to profitability in the back half of the year? Joe Hinrichs : Thanks, Chris. It's Joe. I think at a high level, we've noted some of the things that won't repeat from last year's second-half as you referenced. So we're really focused on getting our manpower levels up to continue to sustain the improved customer service levels that we've been delivering. And Jamie highlighted the trip plan compliance in the second quarter around 84%. We've been in the 80s now pretty regularly since November of last year and that's really resonating with our customers. We're watching very carefully what's happening with the volume. And we have a mixed kind of market out there. And Kevin highlighted, we've seen growth in metals and automotive and other parts of our business. Intermodal has been softer as we highlighted. And chemicals, you know, little down, you know, we'll see when that turns. But generally speaking, our volume has been holding up on the merchandise side. We've been growing merchandise business. So we're watching the volumes very carefully and making sure that we have the staffing levels to support sustained high levels of customer service. And the reason why it's so important is that, Kevin and his team have really started to have some really good conversations with our customers. We gained share in the first-half of the year and that picked up momentum in the second quarter. And we're having very good conversations with our customers now that we're sustaining these high levels -- higher levels of service, and as Jamie noted, we want to continue to improve. But our focus is really on making sure we have the manpower to be able to sustain that. And also, at the same time, of course, if we see volume reductions further than what we're seeing right now it will respond accordingly. But right now, the volumes that we're seeing are supporting this merchandise volume growth and our high levels of service. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore. Your line is now open. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good afternoon. Sean, I wanted to ask you about the productivity improvements. In the first quarter, you said $15 million to $20 million. You said more than $20 million in the second quarter. I think the plan was to eventually get to $30 million. So I guess the question is essentially, do you get to $30 million by the back half of this year as a quarterly run rate? And kind of along the lines of Chris' question, if the volume environment is a bit softer than you had anticipated six months ago, could that $30 million even become greater as you think about 2H \u201823? Sean Pelkey : Thanks, Jon, for your question. Yes, your recollection is right in terms of what we said first quarter. So yes, we are building some momentum with $20 million, a little over $20 million of what I would call sort of fluidity-related savings year-over-year. Now just to be clear, we aren't really counting, sort of, changes in volume in that number up or down if there's costs related to that. This is sort of independent of that. This is things like cycling the cars faster and reducing costs related to that, reducing overtime, things along those lines. We do have line of sight to that number continuing to increase over the balance of the year, and we should be in that $30 million to $40 million range in the second-half of the year is our plan, especially as we get out of summer here and labor availability starts to pick up, we get some more employees out of training. We feel pretty good about what that's going to set us up for in the second half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is now open. Brandon Oglenski : Hey. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Kevin, I was wondering if you could follow-up on the commentary around merchandise pricing reflecting service and a higher inflationary environment, but maybe contrasting that with the loss coal revenue and intermodal surcharges, if you could? Kevin Boone : Yes. I mean when you look at our coal market, and particularly the export market, it moves with the benchmark prices. So that's something that as a swing producer keeps the producers here in the U.S. in the market, and it's worked very, very well and it's a great mechanism. We participate, obviously, when the pricing is very good. I mean it remains very, very supportive. We just had extraordinary prices last year that nobody expected would continue. But again, we participated in that. When you look across our -- the rest of our portfolio, particularly on the merchandise side, it remains supportive of the inflationary environment out there. And our customers are getting price in the market and they're not surprised that our ability to go and have those discussions are similar to what they're having with their customers. So the alignment is there. Certainly, I think the market would be -- people are looking for inflation to come down a little bit, and we'll see how the market continues. But market from a pricing perspective, both in merchandise and maybe a little bit less so in the spot market on the intermodal side, obviously, that's been a little bit softer, but still very, very healthy and will carry forward into next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Afternoon, guys. Sorry about my voice. Hopefully, you can hear me. So the coal RPU guidance was helpful. How should we think about the fuel impact in the third quarter? What are the other puts and takes as I think about operating ratio, profit Q2 to Q3? And then just like bigger picture, it feels like there's still a pretty good gap between underlying pricing and some really elevated inflation. Like, when does that normalize in your mind? Sean Pelkey : Scott, it's Sean. Yes, so in terms of Q3 versus Q2, I mean I think step back just a minute and think about what are we ultimately trying to achieve here. We've got a service product that's -- it's well in excess of where it's been and certainly one of the best, if not the best in the industry. That's ultimately going to translate into the ability to win business off the highway and we're seeing those. We're seeing a number of those opportunities present themselves. Over time, that's going to have a really positive impact not just on margins, but also on obviously being able to grow the top and bottom line of the company. When we look at the third quarter specifically relative to the second, we've got the headwinds that Kevin talked about on coal pricing. We've had positive fuel lag all year long. We're seeing fuel prices settle a little bit here so that could be a little bit of a headwind into the third quarter. And then as I mentioned, we've got the union wage rate increases of 4%. So that will add some costs. In terms of the second-half of your question, the gap between pricing and inflation. We're seeing mid-single-digit inflation across both labor and fringe and purchase services and other. That's going to persist here for the balance of the year. We've got a clean line of sight into the labor line. And most of the PS&O is essentially set for the year from a rate perspective. I would also say, and Kevin can chime in if there's additional info, but I think most of the pricing for the year has been done. We'll start to get into pricing for next year as we get towards the end of the year. And so far, conversations have been -- continue to be very supportive. Kevin Boone : Yeah, I think that's right. We've seen the pricing reflect the inflationary environment. And there's multiyear contracts that we'll still have to touch at the back half of this year that probably need a little bit of catch-up. But beyond that, I think it's well in line with what the inflationary market is out there, particularly on the merchandise business today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ken Hoexter : Hey. Great. Good afternoon. So just to understand this environment, Joe or maybe Kevin, as you move into the third quarter, you're targeting -- still targeting low-single-digit revenue ton-mile growth. I guess you're running about 2% or so year-to-date. So do you think that moves negative based on the current weak volumes that we're seeing so far right now? And then if we do get that weak environment that we're talking about, can you still improve operating ratio as we move into the third quarter if you're looking at revenue stay above cost of inflation? Thanks. Kevin Boone : Yes. I think, Ken, you'll remember, I think as you move into the back half of the year and as you enter into the fourth quarter, we're also going to lap a lot of easier comps, whether it's the international intermodal market or some of the markets that we saw. Some order softness begin in September and really carry through the fourth quarter. So I would say things will probably trend positively through the quarter, which will be helpful from a revenue -- RTM growth perspective. Coal is a dynamic market right now. Look, two weeks, three weeks ago before this hot summer started probably a little bit lower outlook for domestic coal business. But just recently, we're getting a lot more interest and a lot more inbounds on what we can do given some of the heatwaves we're having. In fact, I think we got a heat warning here in Jacksonville this afternoon. So things have been hot. Obviously, that's supportive of that market. And so things can change -- are very dynamic and can change quickly. The destocking, I think, I mentioned it in my prepared remarks. We've seen destocking for a while in some of these markets. I don't -- I can't call the month or the quarter of when that stops, but there's many markets right now where we're underrunning I think, the demand that's out there in the business. So once that normalizes to the underlying demand in the economy, I think that's an opportunity for us, too. And I'm hopeful that as we move into the fourth quarter, we'll see some of those dynamics play out. And then as Joe pointed out, there's -- the team has been doing a fantastic job. And some of the efforts and some of the collaboration that we've had with Jamie and his team on the operations side is resulting in wins and those start to layer in as we move through the year and into next year, and you'll start to see that in our business as well. Sean Pelkey : Yes. And Ken, just on the second part of your question, I think the commentary you heard from Kevin suggests we're not calling a pullback in volumes. But to the extent that the macro presents something like that, there's things that we can do, there's levers that we can pull. And certainly, we would look to do that but not to jeopardize the ability to continue to gain momentum and gain share off of the truck, which is the ultimate goal here to kind of grow the pie and grow our profitability. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. So maybe just on the topic of truckload conversion, it's been mentioned several times on the call. Obviously, it's a big opportunity. But can you give us any context in terms of the wins you're getting or you have line of sight to? Would you be able to quantify that at some point in time because clearly, making the long-term decision to go after that and sounds like you're getting some -- but it's hard to say what relative size that could be? And then, Sean, if you could just clarify cost per employee that we should expect for the next quarter? I know payments go up or the wages go up another 4%, but you got mix over time, a few other things in there as well. So it would be helpful if you can clarify that, too. Thank you. Kevin Boone : Yes. I think in terms of numbers, we'll probably put a finer point on the truck conversion opportunity over the next three years at some time in the future. There's a huge focus by the team to really look at our pipeline and measure it and focus on those customers where there's an opportunity. And some customers have a lot more opportunities than others and making sure we have the resources up against those customers to really drive that conversion. So a lot of activity. We have a lot of new tools internally that we're focused on in terms of measuring that. So our data is getting better and better every day, and there's a lot of momentum. And as I mentioned, our pipeline, as we measure it on a year-over-year basis, is up significantly, up 30%. On a dollar volume perspective, it's up even more than that. So a lot of momentum building. Obviously, the trucking market is not the most receptive market to compete against right now. Hopefully, there's some optimism that's firming up here, and that will even drive more opportunities as we work with customers over the next few months to drive more opportunities. And we're upwards of 25 whiteboarding sessions year-to-date, and those are driving a lot of opportunities. They don't necessarily come to fruition tomorrow. But over the next couple of quarters, we think those are going to translate into a lot of opportunities to shift share from truck as well. So we're -- teams are very, very excited. I don't think we've had this much of momentum in terms of the things that we can control going forward. It's just some of these markets obviously are against us right now. Over to you, Sean. Sean Pelkey : Yeah. Thanks. And in terms of cost per employee, it should be fairly stable other than the 4% wage increase on the union piece. I think there are some opportunities to drive some efficiencies there. So we hope to do better than a 4% increase from the first-half to the second-half, but we'll certainly feel the impact of higher wages. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is open. Justin Long : Thanks. I wanted to ask about intermodal, because there's a big divergence between the domestic intermodal and international intermodal volume trends. And I was wondering if you could share how those numbers compared in the second quarter. And looking into the back half, around your comment about the domestic intermodal market gaining momentum. Is that a function of demand getting better or your expectation for business wins starting to kick in? Thanks. Kevin Boone : Yes. I think when you look at the second quarter, think about the international market being down in that high-teens range. We probably, from a bottom perspective, peak that down in that mid-20s, and it's improved slightly from there. So our exit rate is a little bit better than what we saw middle of the quarter. What we saw through the quarter on the domestic side is sequential improvement month-over-month or on a year-over-year basis each month as we get to move through the quarter. So that gives us optimism there. The team has done, quite frankly, a fantastic job of introducing some new lanes, working with some of our Class 1 partners to do that and identify new business. And some of those things are really playing out. Some of our partners have done really, really well in the market despite some of the, obviously, headwinds there. So working with them, identifying markets where we have some opportunities. And in these kind of markets, it gives you more flexibility to go out there and look at things, look at your network, identify opportunities, try things out that work -- may work and really go after it. So that's what the team has been using the softness in the market to go and do and set us up for growth as the market rebounds. And I think you're starting to see that in the numbers here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is now open. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Great. Good afternoon. Appreciate it. I know you've got a lot of questions, Kevin, on volume. And maybe there's not -- it's tough not to have a clear crystal ball in this type of environment. But I guess, how do you think about the kind of -- you've got good momentum with the service, good discussions with customers. You're talking about the pipeline is good. If we see some improvement get beyond inventory reduction, just see a bit of improvement in demand, do you think you're going to see maybe a bigger cyclical swing up and maybe more evidence of some of that truck conversion coming through? Or, I guess I'm just trying to think about -- we know it's a tough rate backdrop, but what is -- how do these things translate when you see some improvement in markets? Is it mid-single digit volumes higher? How do you think about that potential framework maybe looking at a little ways? Kevin Boone : Yes. I probably won't put numbers around it, but there's a reason we're hiring. There's -- we see all the things that we can control internally, setting us up nicely for when the markets rebound. And yes, I think the combination of markets returning at least to -- in some cases, just the current demand levels is going to create a lot of leverage in our business to do that. And I think you'll see some of these businesses where we're having discussions around truck conversion as the market firms up, more willing to move that freight back over to rail or move it to rail for the first time. So it's -- the pipeline takes a while to build up. It's been -- as Joe was pointing out earlier, it's been about nine months since we've seen that rail improvement. And the customers are reacting to it, some sooner than others. But yeah, that's the idea of all these investments, obviously, will help us participate when that cyclical upside starts to occur. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Fadi Chamoun : Yes. Thank you. My question on the service level, like obviously, you have done a great job in rebuilding the service and doing the -- a comprehensive work on building the culture to sustain that longer term. But as we know, like some of the service issues we saw in the last two or three years were all rail related. You had obviously a lot of friction coming to you from outside of your own network. I'm just wondering, how are you kind of thinking about some of these problems that are affecting your service from outside your network. Some of these partnerships that Kevin talked about, try to kind of iron out some of these friction areas that you see in the supply chain? Or are there opportunities to kind of build the service level that can be sustained even as demand comes back, which historically has been a challenge to service levels? Joe Hinrichs : Yes. Thanks for the question. This is Joe. You're right. Over the last several years, supply chain across the globe was challenged, and we certainly felt the effects of some of that. We've got some benefits from that on the supplemental revenue side of things because things were going up in storage. But generally speaking, from a customer standpoint, it definitely impacted everyone. And as we've noted in the past, around 40% of what we moved on the carload side touches another rail provider. So interchanges are important and the overall service levels of the partners we have across the Class I rails is really important. If you think about going forward, the ports aren't congested as much as they were, and we don't have a lot of the network all gummed up in the intermodal facilities and et cetera. So we should be able to run more fluidly when the market comes back on the intermodal side especially. So I think from a customer perspective, the things that have calmed down help. And as our Class 1 rail partners continue to improve their service, the collective service that we give to the customer holistically will improve as well, which -- that's an opportunity for the whole industry going forward. That's the way we're thinking about it. We can control our piece of it, and we want to keep getting better and more repeatable and more predictable and also working with our Class I rail partners to do the same. At the same time, the other parts of the business have also freed up -- so as Kevin was alluding to, when that market comes back, we'll have the manpower levels, and we'll have the fluidity in our network and the system overall should be able to handle it in a better way, which should be better for the overall economy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Amit Mehrotra : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Kevin, can you just talk about the direction of travel for non-coal yield? I just would have expected a little bit of a better performance in the second quarter sequentially. I know there was a few headwinds that's pretty severe incrementally, that fuel headwind kind of moderates in 3Q. So just wondering what the direction of travel on that is. And then Sean, you made some good progress on PS&O costs in the quarter relative to, I guess, that insurance gain adjusted first quarter. I know you've got some like leases that are expiring around intermodal container storage jars and things like that in the back half. What's the right way to think about PS&O coming down in the back half relative to what you did in the second quarter? Thanks. Kevin Boone : Yes. Obviously, putting coal aside, obviously, that we've talked about on the international side. When you look at yield broadly, there's always mix, right? And when you look at our merchandise business, in general, one of the markets we've highlighted is obviously under cyclical pressure right now is the chemical market, which typically has a higher RPU. So that's weighed on the overall benefit you've seen from the merchandise side, and there's a lot of moving parts within it. But if you look at what we were able to achieve within the individual markets is quite healthy I think despite some of the fuel surcharge headwinds that you saw. The intermodal market obviously is unique, given some of the challenges on the truck and what we have to do there, particularly on the spot market. But again, fuel surcharge is a much larger impact there. And absent that, you saw a flattish-type RPU, and that was mainly impacted by some of our longer-term contracts, obviously had positive rate. But on the flip side, some of the spot markets saw some significant downgrade along with the truck. But the market held in, obviously, a lot better than some of the trucking rates out there and what the markets do there. But overall, I was very pleased in some of the NPA results as we measure it or some of the highest results that we've seen in a long time, if you look broadly across the markets. Sean Pelkey : And Amit, your question on PS&O, I'm always hesitant to predict that line, because there's a number of different puts and takes within it that can impact the quarter. I will say that we are very -- we're focused on cost control and we're making sure that we've got only the costs that are necessary in order to move the volume to the extent that intermodal volumes pick up a little bit, that will have an impact on PS&O costs. But outside of volume-related expenses, I would fully expect that we'd be able to, kind of, hold the line on the improvement that you saw in the second quarter in PS&O going forward. And if you look at it on a year-over-year basis for the second-half, that means we'll probably be able to absorb most of the inflationary impact in the second half, notwithstanding any sort of volume-related impacts that we might see. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open. David Vernon : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the call and thanks for taking the question. So Kevin, just to kind of dig into the mid-teens guidance for RPU sequentially. Does that kind of bring us to mark-to-market for $225? And then how do we think about the sensitivity? Can we extrapolate that sensitivity going forward if we're going to expect sort of benchmark pricing to either go up or down? Is that a good way to think about the sensitivity on further price changes? Because $225 was still, call it, $75 above the long-run average in the prior decade. Kevin Boone : Yes, I think that's fair. Obviously, there's bottoms, right, and there's -- we protect ourselves both on the bottom and then on the top end. We don't participate in some of the extreme stream cases, but I think that's fair. $225 is kind of embedded in what we're coming into the quarter. We've seen a little bit of positive uplift in that so even as recently as the last couple of days. So we'll see where that trends. But we've seen a lot of stability, if not a little slight uptick in that market here recently, and we'll see what the fourth quarter brings. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Paul Stoddard : Hi. This is Paul Stoddard on for Jordan. I guess with the recent agreement on the West Coast for the Long shoremen, there's some anticipation that there could be some more freight being diverted back to the West Coast. I guess how are you thinking about that in terms of international intermodal long-term? And do you think that's going to be offset by domestic intermodal? Thanks. Kevin Boone : I think the long-term trend, if you just go to Charleston, you go to Savannah and you look at all the investments being made, there's a long-term growth opportunity on the East Coast and you'll continue to see our growth in the East Coast, which we'll continue to serve and benefit from. Some stability on the West Coast is going to be helpful. As you know, a lot of our international business still comes across the West through Chicago and other interchange points. And unfortunately, a lot of that volume given some of the congestion on the West was either trucked, and we didn't see that volume. So as that -- we should benefit from a recovery there. So I don't see it as necessarily taking share away from what we're doing in the East, more as something that -- obviously, if the rails in the West begin to perform better on a year-over-year basis will benefit the Eastern network and some of that traffic coming to us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good evening. Just want to go back to Brian's question on modal conversion. When you talk to customers that aren't quite ready to convert yet, is it simply price that's holding them back? Or is there something from a service perspective that they're looking for you to provide that's just not quite there yet? Just any thoughts on that. Thanks. Kevin Boone : Look, I think the most important thing for a customer is reliability, right? And in some customers' eyes, they want to see more of that reliability. They like what they see today. We've got to continue to perform and have those conversations. And sometimes it's lane-by-lane. It's carload-by-carload where we get that confidence from a customer. And so we're in the very early innings of this, and we feel the acceleration from first quarter to second quarter, and I expect those conversations to pick up even more in the third and fourth quarters as we continue to perform. Sharing what we're doing on the hiring side is incredibly helpful. Sharing with them what we plan to do to make our network more resilient, winning their confidence, but that's the number one issue. It's not price. 99% of the time, we have a pricing advantage versus our truck competitor. So that's the opportunity for us. We have the environmental advantages. So we have all these things, we've just got to get the reliability and prove that the reliability is sustainable. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much, operator. I just wanted to shift focus from -- the pipeline looks really good, Kevin, and presumably that's merchandise base mainly. But looking into 2024 on some of your bulk areas and in particular, ag and coal, the EIA has just revised downward its forecast for next year by quite a bit? And then on the ag side, it looks like there's some severe drought conditions forming that's going to impact the current growing season. So looking into 2024, I mean that suggests that we could be bracing for some down double digit volume growth in those two categories. Is there any offsets there that you would flag for next year that would offset some of those fairly negative forecast for those two particular commodities? Kevin Boone : Well, really hot summer certainly doesn't hurt and that's what we're in the middle of. Obviously, from a coal perspective and you're referencing mainly the domestic side, that's obviously dependent on the weather conditions and the weather I think is a surprise from a heat perspective to the upside here over the last few weeks. And we're seeing that with a lot of our customers running full out here and replenishing some of the inventory levels. And so we'll see how the winter plays out. I think it's really, really early in July to call 2024. That seems a bit premature to me. We see a very healthy export market as well. Obviously, that's driven by global macro conditions. But we have new supply coming online that will ramp up next year. That supply is going to land in the market. It's very competitive in the market, and we expect to participate in it. Many of the mines that we serve are going to be in the market almost no matter what conditions. So we see the volume there sustainable. On the ag side, again, I followed these markets for a long time. I think July is a little bit premature as well. It has been hot out there. We'll see how the market firms up here, but there's a lot of moving parts. We're seeing a little bit of weakness here in the third quarter, but we see some good indications into the fourth quarter. So we'll see how that trends, and we'll watch the crop conditions as you are to see how that moves into the back half of the year. Obviously, we don't have as large of a franchise on that side as some of the other railroads, particularly in the West from an export perspective. So a little less exposure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Elliot Alper : Great. Thank you. This is Elliot Alper on for Jason. On the international intermodal side, last quarter, you talked about how some of your larger customers were expecting a pickup in the back half of the year. So I guess, what have your customers said that has changed over the past three months that has resulted in no inflection yet? Maybe there's been any change in view into peak season? Thanks. Kevin Boone : I don't -- I wouldn't read any of our comments that there's been any type of inflection down. We're just -- I don't think there's -- we're seeing in real-time an inflection up in the market. And I mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we obviously start to lap a lot easier comps on a year-over-year basis. So I think from a overall growth perspective, fourth quarter will be a much easier comp than what we've seen throughout the year. And hopefully, that momentum will carry into next year. But there's no indications that the market is necessarily picking up. I don't -- I think we bottomed from that perspective. The question is how quickly the market recovers. And that will be heavily relying on the consumer and how that pans out into the holiday season going forward. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session for today and today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Krista, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2023 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Matt Korn, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Matt Korn : Thank you, Krista. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In the presentation accompanying this call, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. And with that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs. Joe Hinrichs : All right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call today. Over this last year, CSX mission and message have remained clear and consistent. We have seen great progress with our ONE CSX initiatives, which are helping to build a focused, collaborative culture that enables all of our employees to feel engaged, energized and focused on working better together. At the same time, our service levels continue to lead the industry. These successes go hand in hand. And as our customers see that CSX is truly dedicated to providing consistent, reliable service over the long term, they're responding positively. As we look forward to all the opportunities ahead, we are confident that these efforts we are making will drive clear, sustainable, profitable growth. And we took another step forward on this path this quarter. Thanks to the hard work put in by our ONE CSX team, our railroad is running well. Our merchandise business remained steady, and our coal shipments were very strong. Our domestic intermodal volumes are growing well compared to last year. Our international intermodal business, though down year-over-year, has stabilized. Overall, our network continues to perform, and I am pleased with how the team has succeeded in managing the things that we can control. I continue to be very excited about all the potential ahead for CSX. Now, let's turn to Slide 5 to review the highlights for the third quarter. First, we moved over 1.5 million carloads this quarter, which was down just slightly from a year ago, with flat year-over-year performance in merchandise and 9% growth in coal. Our operating ratio ticked up into the low 60% as we faced challenges that we have been talking about all year, with lower fuel recovery, reduced intermodal storage revenue, lower export coal prices, and higher costs of inflation, most notably with our labor contract. As in previous quarters, our margin does include the impact of the Quality Carriers trucking business. Second, we generated $3.6 billion in revenue, which was 8% lower than the previous year. The last year we benefited from high diesel prices and record export coal benchmarks that were both much lower this quarter. Third, even with the year-over-year changes we faced, charges -- changes we faced, operating income still came in at $1.3 billion for the quarter compared to a little under $1.6 billion last year. And our earnings per share were $0.42, down from $0.52. I am proud of what we accomplished this quarter given all the challenges. None of us here are satisfied with these results. We're not sitting back and simply waiting for markets to turn. We're looking throughout the entire network to see where we can operate more efficiently. We continue to work closely with our customers to build our business pipeline and drive more volume onto the railroad. And we're emphasizing the importance of cost discipline to every team in every one of our locations. One of the reasons I am so confident about what is ahead for CSX is the great leadership team that we have in place. As you all saw last month, we are very pleased to announce that Mike Cory has joined our railroad as Chief Operating Officer. Mike brings great experience and a thorough understanding of schedule railroading, and he also shares our deep dedication and appreciation for customer service and the employees who provide that service day in and day out. Mike arrived in Jacksonville a few weeks ago and is now here joining us on this call. And so, I will now turn it over to Mike to say a few words and cover our operational performance over the quarter. Mike Cory : Well, thank you very much, Joe. And I truly appreciate the words. And I'm extremely thankful for the opportunity to work with such a committed team of people with so much potential to lead this industry with great customer service. Safety, service, efficiency, and along with engagement with each other, customers and stakeholders, is how we're going to leverage this great franchise to be best in class. And I've been here a short time, pretty much less than a month, but I've been really busy. I've visited major yards, coal export facilities, and I've spent time in headquarters meeting with an array of people from different functions of the railroad. Well, in person, I've listened to and I've spoken with employees from all across the company; from people on the ground executing the plan, from people developing the plan, to sales and marketing, finance, field and network ops, IT facilities, and the list goes on. But what really resonates with me is their collective desire to be the best they can be for our ONE CSX team and our customers. And we've got great talent in all our functions, and our job is to connect the talent and maximize the value of their efforts. We're doing this in order for our team to be the best at providing what our customers need in the safest and most efficient way. We're doing this because decision-making, acting on what they see and know, must be quick and done as close to where the opportunity is taking place. That said, I see opportunities, one of which, and to me, the most important at this stage, is to create and share a robust and visible flow of information that will derive improvement through the continuation of the lean principles that define schedule railroad. We all need to see the effects of our collective decisions as fast as possible, be more nimble and responsive to our customers' needs. As well, collectively we'll learn and share best practices throughout the organization from this and other available data as it gives us a platform to learn as it happens. This will create the speed and the trust that we need to move together as one team. So, let's go over to the slides and we'll start looking at our safety metrics. Our third quarter injury and accident rates increased as we saw track-caused and human factor incidents trend upward. These aren't acceptable outcomes for us. And we're taking action to continuously improve the environment our employees operate in, as well as the overall safety culture. Human factor incidents, especially with newly hired employees, is one of the trends this year that have driven the increase. In Q3, the team added additional time for initial training for our new conductors at our REDI Center in Atlanta. We also looked at the length of training when new hires graduate from Atlanta and report back to their home terminals and increase the length of that training as well. Increased training gives us more time to develop skills with our new hires, but we also determined we needed to place resources to spend that time with them. So, we train unionized mentors and now we have them across the property with the new hires. These mentors are available to teach and answer questions, reinforcing the ONE CSX culture by being part of developing and coaching their newly hired peers. Lastly, on safety, we're not taking our focus off life-changing events. We've partnered with DEKRA, a speciality risk management group, to rollout training to help employees self-identify risk in an ever-changing environment. Now traditionally, railroads train on operating rules, but we can't write a rule for everything or test our way to a positive safety culture. Both identification of risk and eliminating that risk when possible is one of our major goals moving into Q4 and beyond. So, let's go over to the next slide on our operating highlights. Our end-to-end train velocity averaged 17.6 miles an hour in the third quarter, slightly lower than last quarter, but still up substantially from the same period in 2022. Dwell averaged 9.6 hours, an improvement of nearly 20% compared to the same period last year. Intermodal trip plan performance was 94% and increased by 4 percentage points year-over-year, while carload trip plan performance was 82% and improved by 25 percentage points. Our service performance remains fluid. And though we did see a slight seasonal dip during the middle of the quarter during peak vacation and holiday season, our metrics are rebounding into the fourth quarter. We all know and we will -- we all know we will and we're all working together to improve these results. Our ability to leverage this great franchise by connecting the people and the vast talent they bring will allow us to improve all key aspects of our business, with a strong focus on those lean management principles that drive reliable, consistent service. I'm really confident that connecting all of these dots together is going to result in a strong team now, and, more importantly, bench strength for the future. This is really our ONE CSX goal. And so, with that, over to you, Kevin. Kevin Boone : Thank you. Mike and I have been spending a lot of time together and it is really great to have you on the team. To start, I'm pleased to say that our improving service levels are a key differentiator in the marketplace. I can't thank the entire team enough for all the hard work. These improvements are being recognized by our customers and are leading to new initiatives and discussions around how CSX can partner with our customers for growth. Our ability to grow profitably requires us to be proactive, quickly adapt to changing markets, and think differently. I'm proud of how well we have been able to coordinate with operations to drive both growth and efficiencies. With Mike in his role, we have only seen these efforts accelerate. It's no surprise that overall economic conditions remain uncertain, but it has been encouraging to see gradually improving sequential trends across several of our end markets over this past quarter. We see many, many reasons to be optimistic as we continue to build our business pipeline with an eye toward 2024 and beyond. Turning to Slide 10 to look at our merchandise performance for the quarter. Our revenues were down modestly compared to last year on flat volumes, as solid core pricing gains were offset by lower fuel surcharge and negative mix effects in certain markets. Our automotive business continued to show strength with higher production and business wins driving a 19% increase in volume year-over-year. Minerals continues to perform very well, sustained by infrastructure activity that is supporting new cement facilities and healthy demand for aggregates. Metals performance has also benefited from our service levels, leading to competitive wins and solid demand. Our chemical franchise, while challenged, has begun to stabilize and even showed some promising improvement in domestic plastics over the quarter. Fertilizer revenue growth was strong in the quarter, despite volumes that were impacted by weaker short-haul movements with production challenges in Florida. As we expected, the strong Southeastern corn crop meant less rail volume for grain, and forest products remains one of the most challenged areas with many mills still taking meaningful downtime. As we start the fourth quarter, we are encouraged by the early October volume trends with most markets showing sequential momentum. We anticipate a strong rebound for ag and food as a strong Midwest harvest kicks in. And across other markets, we expect our service improvements to drive opportunities to win in the marketplace as we focus on modal conversion. Turning to Slide 11. Third quarter coal revenue declined 5%, even though volumes were very strong, growing 9% compared to last year. Export demand continued to be a major volume driver, growing 26%, with the hot summer also supporting solid domestic demand. Strong coal volumes minimize the effects of lower international benchmark prices, which were setting all-time records this time last year. The key difference was met coal pricing where global benchmarks were much lower than in the same period last year. Sequentially, our coal RPU declined 11% compared to our guidance of mid-teens decline, with stronger-than-expected shipments to longer length of haul Southern utility customers driving the moderate outperformance. Looking ahead to the last quarter of the year, we expect export markets to remain strong and are pleased with the increases in international benchmarks that we've seen over the last several weeks. On the domestic side, we have seen stockpiles normalize and demand in the 2024 will be driven by winter weather and related demand needs. The increase in global benchmark prices should benefit our cold yields next quarter. So, I would remind you that we have a diverse portfolio of met customers and we have seen U.S.-based met coal benchmarks and those in other regions lag spot prices in Australia. Turning to intermodal on Slide 12. As a whole, the business remained challenged with revenue declining by 14% and total volume decreasing by 7%. Overall, RPU declined by 8% year-over-year with the impact of lower fuel surcharge accounting for the decline, partially offset by positive price. That said, we are seeing encouraging trends from our domestic business. Our volume turned positive on a year-over-year basis early in the summer, and that's continued to improve since then. We offer a diverse mix of transportation solutions within domestic intermodal, and we've seen great results from our strong channel partnerships and our direct relationships with major retailers. Our team has been successful in converting traffic off the highway in a market facing plentiful truck capacity, which is a testament to the team in the market-leading service product. Meanwhile, international intermodal activity has stabilized but remains weak. We haven't seen any clear signs of a positive inflection yet. Retailers remain concerned about the health of the consumer. And though de-stocking may have slowed, we haven't seen this turn into sustained increases in order rates or imports. For the rest of the year, we expect trends to largely continue as they were over the third quarter, with domestic gradually strengthening, supported by our team strong sales efforts. While we prepare for the turning point for international, recall that we saw meaningful drop offs in our intermodal volume in the back half of the fourth quarter in 2022, as markets slowed substantially, which will benefit our reported growth rate for the current quarter. Slide 13 provides a clear illustration of the encouraging signs we're seeing within our intermodal business. On a year-over-year basis, domestic intermodal has shown a favorable trend since the beginning of 2023, turning positive around mid-year and steadily improving since. While international volumes remain lower compared to 2022, we've seen stability in the past few months. Altogether, across all of our businesses, our team continues to push forward across multiple initiatives, aimed at winning wallet share, converting truck traffic and bringing new customers to the railroad. We remain confident that our leading service performance will continue to provide opportunities to win business. And we know that we have the resources and capacity in place to deliver growth when the market environment inflects. I'm proud of what the collective CSX team has accomplished this quarter. I'm excited about all the potential ahead. Now, I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss financials. Sean Pelkey : Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. The third quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was lower by 18% or $284 million. These results include nearly $350 million of year-over-year impacts from lower intermodal storage revenue, export coal benchmark prices, and fuel recovery, partly offset by $42 million of favorability related to last year's labor agreement adjustment. Suffice it to say this quarter should represent the peak year-over-year impact from these discrete items. Revenue fell by 8% or $323 million despite strong pricing across many merchandise portfolio along with positive volume trends across many merchandise markets, as well as domestic intermodal. The operating team also worked tirelessly to meet customer needs and deliver a 9% increase in coal volume. Across merchandise, coal and intermodal, revenue excluding fuel recovery increased 2% in the quarter and was up mid-single digits, excluding the impacts of coal RPU headwinds. Expenses were lower by 2%, and I will discuss the line items in more detail on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $13 million higher compared to the prior year. Income tax expense decreased $32 million as the impact of lower pre-tax earnings more than offset a prior year favorable state tax item. And this quarter's effective tax rate came in at 24.9%. As a result, earnings per share fell by $0.10, including nearly $0.12 of impact from the previously mentioned discrete items. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. Total third quarter expense decreased by $39 million. Lower fuel prices and cycling the prior year labor true-up were mostly offset by the impacts of inflation and higher depreciation. Turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe expense decreased $7 million as the prior year union labor adjustment was largely offset by inflation and increased headcount. Heightened attention to overtime benefited cost per employee, particularly in our mechanical workforce where overtime ratios are now running at multi-year lows. Purchased services and other expense increased $25 million versus last year, including $16 million associated with higher casualty expense. Turning to sequential performance versus Q2 on the right-hand side of the page, network performance and numerous cost control initiatives in the quarter drove a nearly $20 million reduction in PS&O across our operating departments. We expect these savings to remain in the fourth quarter aside from normal seasonality. Depreciation was up $21 million as a result of last year's equipment study, as well as a larger asset base. Fuel cost was down $89 million, mostly driven by a lower gallon price. This was partially offset by higher consumption, including approximately 2.5 million gallons recognized from prior periods. Adjusting for this, fuel efficiency was still unfavorable versus the prior year. And Mike has brought an increased focus on this critical measure. While seasonality will impact fuel efficiency in Q4, we fully expect to get back on trend. Equipment and rents was $10 million favorable, driven by faster freight car cycle times across all markets. These benefits were partly offset by costs related to higher automotive volumes. Finally, property gains were $21 million unfavorable in the quarter. As a reminder, we are cycling over $50 million of prior year gains in Q4 and expect sales this year to be minimal. Now turning to cashflow and distributions on Slide 17. Reflecting the discrete factors I discussed earlier, free cashflow is down from the prior year, but remains strong, supporting investments in the safety and reliability of our network, as well as an increased level of high return strategic investments. Robust cashflow has also supported over $3.5 billion in shareholder returns so far this year, including $2.9 billion in share repurchases and over $650 million of dividends. Economic profit, as measured by CSX cash earnings, is about $160 million lower year-to-date, impacted again by intermodal storage revenue and export coal pricing. Nevertheless, the focus on economic profit is helping to incent a pipeline of high return initiatives that will deliver growth and ongoing efficiency gains. Now with that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. Joe Hinrichs : All right. Thank you, Sean. Now as shown on Slide 19, we will finish with some updated comments on our outlook as we approach the final quarter of 2023. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in revenue ton-miles for the full year, supported by our consistent performance in merchandise and export coal. Automotive and minerals remain important growth areas. So, obviously, we're watching developments with the [Detroit Three] (ph) automakers and the UAW very closely. As Kevin mentioned, we also look for a substantial rebound in our ag and food business over the fourth quarter. Export coal volumes remain strong as global demand stays high for U.S. met and thermal coal. For domestic coal, we anticipate some slowdown from the third quarter, which benefited from hot summer weather, though so far this quarter we continue to be pleased with our shipment levels. For intermodal, as we mentioned, we expect domestic activity to keep gaining modest momentum through the fourth quarter. While for now, our international business looks largely stable. Overall, our volume growth rate in intermodal will reflect favorable year-over-year comparisons. As we've said all year, the pricing environment remains supportive, and we have been encouraged by the agreements that you've already reached for 2024. Note that with the slowdown in intermodal storage revenue that we have seen over the course of this year, we are now expecting supplemental revenue, excluding trucking, to decline by $325 million for the full year. Our commitment to efficiency and cost control remains in place as we keep our eye on service performance, not just in the near term, but also as we look ahead to improve market conditions and greater demand for rail capacity. Finally, our estimate of $2.3 billion in capital expenditures remains unchanged, along with our strong focus on innovation and growth. I will close by saying that I'm very proud of what we've accomplished as ONE CSX team as I finished my first year with CSX. When I spoke to all of you last fall, we talked about our belief that CSX could accomplish great things and create so much value by working better together as one team to serve our customers. We have made very good progress. And all of us know that there remains so much more we can do. I'm even more enthusiastic about our opportunities than I was last year. We all appreciate your support and interest in our company and we keep -- as we keep moving forward. All right, thank you. And Matthew, we're now ready for questions. Matt Korn : Thank you, Joe. We will now move to our question-and-answer session. Now, in the interest of time and to make sure that everyone on this call has an opportunity, we ask you to please limit yourselves to one question. Krista, we're ready to start the process. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe Joe or Mike, kind of wanted to start with your sense of where you are in terms of resources and services relative to the volume environment. So, headcount moved up again. Maybe give us -- if you can give us a sense of where you think you need to take that or if you're at reasonable staffing levels? And maybe how we think about, like I said, that resource base relative to the volume environment? Do you have the ability to do more at these current levels, or are we still in a little bit of the recovery phase? Mike Cory : Hey, Chris, it's Mike. Look, and again, I'm going to preface every -- probably most of my answers with, I've been here less than a month, but we still have the training pipeline. We still have people that we need to get into position that I spoke of earlier. But overall, I'm comfortable that we have enough to improve the size of train, the amount of trains, the velocity with the people we have. But however, there are areas where we're probably getting affected somewhat on the flow of the goods. And so, it's constant. We're working -- not just Kevin and I, but our teams together. So they really get the ground floor view of what we can do. And not having been here for that long, I haven't really stretched the opportunities out there yet. So, I'd say, to answer your question, we're where we need to be. We have people that are being trained that are going to be positioned. And remember, we have attrition, whether its retirement or whatever the case. So, we're filling that. And with the people we have. We're in good shape. We have to get in better shape, and a lot of that's going to come from self-help and how we utilize the assets. Joe Hinrichs : Yeah. Chris, just the last thing I'll add is, as Mike mentioned, we're still hiring in a few key locations. That's down to a little more than a handful. And largely, we're in pretty good shape in most other spots. And with the natural attrition we have, we're still hiring to replace some of that because we are still -- our merchandise volume is up this year. So, we're still seeing some growth in volume. But we feel pretty good about our ability to manage that. And Mike has really challenged the team to come with a new set of -- fresh new set of eyes to look at how we can do some self-help to free up some of our crews to help us even be more efficient. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, thanks for taking the question. And Mike, welcome back to the industry. Congrats. Just wanted to ask more about the -- excuse me, on the service side, maybe for Kevin. You're seeing some conversion that you mentioned of areas that have excess truck capacity. So, is the stuff that you thought you lost before and was going to come back, or has the service been so good for so long that people actually going to convert and stay there? Just trying to get a sense of the stickiness of that. And then, Sean, if you can just give us some comments on the cost per employee for the fourth quarter? It looks like overtime is coming down quite a bit. There's always mix and trainees involved. So, any color on that would be helpful. Thank you. Kevin Boone : Yeah. I would say on the truck conversion side, we're really, really early into this thing. The good news is customers are willing to start to have those conversations that quite frankly we just couldn't have a year ago, given where we were. And so, we're building momentum. I expect this to build on itself into next year. The great thing is, I think as an industry, we're starting to become aligned in terms of going after growth, going after some of the opportunities that exist out there collectively as an industry, and I think that's very encouraging as well. But it's a mixture. It's a mixture of going after new customers. Clearly, you pointed out, the trucking market is not very supportive right now. But even in this market, we're finding customers that, with ESG and with other things, are wanting to have that discussion. There's still value that we can drive. But I only expect as that trucking market firms up in the next year and the years ahead that this will accelerate on itself and see a lot of momentum coming. Sean Pelkey : Brian, on your follow-up question around cost per employee, we did -- made a lot of progress on the overtime front in the third quarter. That's an area that Mike has been focused on right from the very beginning, trying to figure out ways we can restructure the work and eliminate waste in certain locations. So that's going to help. I will say though sequentially Q3 to Q4, you probably will see still an uptick in cost per employee like we normally do. That's driven by some capital work labor that will go over to OE in the fourth quarter. We also have some seasonal vacation and some accruals that will hit in the fourth quarter. So I would say, sequentially Q3 to Q4, you'll probably see comp per employee up a few percent. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good evening, and thanks for taking my question. And Mike, welcome back as well. And I guess, Mike, can I just ask you, the U.S. roads historically just haven't had a great track record of organic growth and we know it seems like coal have been a long-term headwind. But what have you seen in your first month or so that you like to see at the CSX plan or changes you want to make that will help with this idea that CSX can outgrow the market looking ahead? Mike Cory : Hey, Brandon. Thank you. Wow. I mentioned in my remarks, the visibility of information and it just -- it creates this connection where people see -- we have people that manage terminals, that manage the dispatch on the road, we have people that manage people from a crew management perspective, we manage -- look, we do all these things individually and to see that altogether and then again back to being understanding of what it is you can do, whether it's from a capacity or service perspective, but then cutting in with Kevin's team, we can get sticky because we can really understand all the work we're doing is really to get that business is to keep that business. And I see that here -- the opportunity here is -- look, the railway I came from, you got the business, you went 1,200, 1,500 miles and then there was more business here, it's everywhere. And it's not -- it's competitive, but there's lots of that. And Kevin -- we're not talking so much about the truck. Obviously, we're going to grow with the market and what it gives us, but I just -- I think the opportunity here when we connect our people, we are everywhere. We service, what is it, two-thirds of the U.S. market. And that's just opportunity in itself is. So, I don't know if I'm answering your question. Again, I've been here a month. But I see that, that's really what our goal is. We want to grow properly. We wanted to be ratable. We want to make sure that we're in position for it. And we're going to make sure that we rid ourselves of waste. So, we're not getting rid of the assets that we need when it does come. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chappell from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Jonathan Chappell : Thank you. Good afternoon. Mike, I kind of want to build on that and you kind of brought up your former role as well. You transitioned there from a PSR railroad to a growth railroad, and maybe that didn't go as smoothly as you would have hoped. So, you're not joining a fixer-upper here. CSX's service metrics have improved vastly over the last year or two, and now you're pivoting the growth. So, what are some of the lessons that you've learned from that transition at the last role on some of the dangers to avoid? And how you manage capacity as you're trying to fill the network without clogging up the network and causing service issues? Mike Cory : Thanks, Jonathan. One of the wounds just opened up. Look, it's no different. We have to be really aligned. First of all, we have to understand what our assets and our people can do for us and expand on that, obviously. But I just don't see the market, the commodities we move being the same as the growth is where I came from. And so, again, I have a long way to go to understand the market and I'm working extremely hard with Kevin to understand it. But look, the principles are the same. We sell a service, we deliver a service. And how fast we recover from any service disruptions is key to keeping the customer knowing that our goal is to be the reliable provider for them. So, I don't see any difference. And you can go back and take a look at the hockey stick recovery and all that great history, but I'm looking forward. And I don't think anything changes in my view as to how we approach this. We know what we can do, and we continue to really stay close. And again, the teams being together from the ground floor up, there shouldn't be surprises. And if there are, we're going to build our resiliency so that we can attack it again and again be reliable for the customer. So, I don't see that big of a difference in terms of the model that we have here or where we have -- wherever we have, what we had -- what I had before. It's sell the service, deliver the service. And Kevin is really working hard with his team on ratability. So, there shouldn't be surprises. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe Kevin, any -- just any color on how much of a uptick in the coal yield we should expect in Q4 and into Q1? And then maybe just Sean, just help us think about some of the puts and takes for Q4. It just sounds like better volume, less of a fuel headwind, maybe some met uplift, but maybe some continued cost pressure. So, you put it altogether, that's -- you think operating ratio gets better or worse from Q3? Any directional color you want to give us? Kevin Boone : Yeah. Scott, there can be a lot of mix issues within our coal business. When you think about Southern utilities, longer length of haul, higher RPU versus Northern utilities. Export coal, very, very good business, can be shorter haul, so can sometimes be a little bit lower RPU as well. But [indiscernible] given some of the benchmark strength that we've seen, I would look for something in the low-single digits, maybe mid-single digits depending on mix. Sean Pelkey : Yeah. And Scott, on your question around Q4, I think you did a good job of kind of summarizing the factors. We're off to a good start in terms of the volume, and that's obviously one of the most important factors in terms of not only seeing OR stay stable to improve, but also more importantly growing our earnings. As you mentioned, fuel should be a little bit less of a negative here in Q4 than it was in Q3. We'll see what the direction of fuel prices is, but we have $30 million lag in the third quarter that we don't expect to repeat. And then in terms of the cost, seasonally, we typically do see higher costs in Q4 than Q3. So, if you were to look over the last five years, each and every one of those years, the OR has been worse in Q4 than Q3, and everything except for 2020, the COVID year, operating income has been down sequentially from the third quarter. Now, we're off to a good start like I said, and we've got our eyes fixed on places that we can eliminate waste and control costs. So I think we've got a good shot of bucking that seasonal trend and doing a little bit better than that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Please go ahead. Justin Long : Thanks, and good afternoon. Kevin, it sounds like you've recently had some early success with market share gains both truck and rail. But could you expand a little bit more on the commodity groups where you're seeing the most meaningful tailwinds on that front? And as we move into 2024, where you see the most opportunity to keep that momentum going? Kevin Boone : Yeah. I think it's really within our merchandise portfolio and it's broad-based. There's different initiatives across the board from our metals side of the business which I highlighted. Automotive has been a good strength for us. And it's all on the back of service that's differentiated in the market, and we've really been able to capitalize on that with the customer. The customers are looking for reliable service, and I think we've been a standout in the market here year-to-date, and our team has been selling it, and it's been incredibly helpful on that side. I will say we're going to start to see some benefits of the industrial development side, more in probably the '25, '26, but you'll start to see that layer in, in late '24 and got a lot of momentum there. And again, it goes back to the service product that we've been able to deliver and getting the confidence as these industries build new plants that are locating on our railroad. So, I actually just sat down with Christina this afternoon, and we were going through all the industrial projects that have been taking place throughout the U.S. And it's interesting, you look at a map holistically throughout the U.S. and it's almost focused on the East and that's all railroad. That's where we operate and that's where our team is really going after it today. And I'm very, very optimistic on what's happening in that side. So, a lot of opportunities. They are mixed across different industries, and every industry is created a little bit different, but we are being able to lean into those conversations, quite different environment than what was occurring last year, but very, very optimistic here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks a lot. Hi, everyone. Sean, I wanted to just follow up on that question around 3Q to 4Q, but maybe ask it as it relates to 2024. I mean, obviously we're moving from a very inflationary environment to a less inflationary environment. You've got a little bit of labor -- another uptick in labor in the middle of next year. But then I also look at like PS&O, is that -- 19% of revenue, several years ago was as low as 14%, 15% of revenue. But there's obviously some opportunity to get more leverage on the cost structure, especially on that big PS&O item. So, I don't know if you can kind of help us enter your brain a little bit and think what is the cost structure look like in '24? Because, obviously, we're still in an inflationary environment, but you still got maybe these chunky, idiosyncratic opportunities to kind of leverage some parts of the cost structure. Sean Pelkey : Yeah. Amit, obviously, we're still in the planning phases for 2024. So, I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves here. But you know the story on labor and just to make sure everybody understands and to level set, we're going to have a 4.5% wage increase mid-year next year, that's the last year of the contract with the union employees. That's a step up from the 4% increase that we had mid-year this year. In terms of PS&O, at least on the inflationary side, it's early, but I think it's fair to say that we'll start to see some normalization of the inflationary pressures from this year. So, we had mid-single digit inflation this year. It'll probably be a little bit less than that, but certainly higher than the five-year average as some of those outside service contracts are based on lagging indicators or labor indices that are going to reset. So, suffice it to say, I do think we've got fewer headwinds overall going into next year than we did going into this year. And that sets us up well. We've got cost and efficiency opportunities, but I think more importantly, Kevin and the team are building a really nice pipeline of growth that really stems from the way that we've been serving the customer over the last year. And that sustained service level as well as some of the initiatives the team has been working on, that's really what's going to drive growth as we get into next year and beyond. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please go ahead. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah, good afternoon. Wanted to see, I guess, it's kind of staying in the same topic, Sean, but if you think about 2024 and volume sensitivity in terms of how the OR performs, do you think that there's a chance that you could see improvement in the OR if you don't see volume growth? And perhaps related to that, from a pricing perspective, I think sometimes people think that there is a time delay on some of the pricing with multi-year contracts and there might be catch-up on pricing related to inflation. So, I guess, it's kind of two things within that, just OR sensitivity to volume and also potential catch-up on pricing. Thank you. Sean Pelkey : Yeah, Tom. So, I mean, our plan is going to be to grow volume ahead of the economy, that's what we're going to shoot for, that's what we're going to plan for. So I think if we were to have no growth next year, I think it would be tough to improve the OR with the continued inflationary pressures that we're seeing. You're cycling. We had that insurance settlement earlier in the year. So, there's a few things there. Depreciation will continue to go up, things like that. So, we need growth. That's what the model requires and that's what we're building into the plan. Kevin, I don't know if you want to address the price piece. Kevin Boone : Yeah. On the pricing, roughly 60% of our business reprices every year and 30% of that is kind of carryover of what we've already touched this year. So, we'll touch the other half going into next year and the environment is still supportive and it certainly helps when the service product is vastly improved. And we'll continue to price to our service levels, and those are up. And so, it's a conversation that customers expect. Our labor inflation is very visible to the world. We have those discussions. They're not unexpected from the customer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Allison Poliniak : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just want to go back to the domestic intermodal side. You're starting to see some conversion from truck here. When you're talking to customers, what's really starting -- holding them back from converting at this point? Is there something in the service product that you have to evolve, or is it just simply building that trust with the reliability that you guys have had over the past few months? Just any thoughts there? Joe Hinrichs : Yeah, to reflect on the pandemic and that's -- the domestic intermodal and our intermodal franchise performed very, very well. It really was outshined the industry in a lot of ways. What minimized our growth opportunity was really the chassis and some of the equipment limitations that existed. So, obviously, we're in a very, very different world today. And so those limitations don't exist on a year-over-year basis. And we're really seeing the team able to capitalize on that. And the strength of our service product is really coming through. When you see what we talked about in the chart that we mentioned previously is, I think all those things are coming together. Service leading in the East, and then allowing our customers to grow with us with our service product. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ken Hoexter : Hey, great. Good afternoon. Mike, welcome back to the sector and happy to have you here. Joe or Mike, I guess, just operations seem pretty solid, right, in terms of how well you're operating and obviously you still want to improve. And maybe Mike, just talk about what -- I know you've been there for a month, but what do you see as, I don't know, if it's low-hanging fruit or opportunities on operations? It sounds like Sean saying or Kevin saying, you need the volumes in order to get that operating leverage, but are there things you can do on the cost side from what you see that can aid that leverage opportunity? Mike Cory : Yeah, I can, thanks. Look, visibility of waste and getting it and collating that information so that I can -- what I do is I try to teach and learn, learn and teach. That's really what it's about. So, we have a good group of people, many of them younger, haven't been experienced in the positions they're in. So that's really where I've been focusing, first of all, to get a temperature read, but really start to share with them how to go about getting at that waste. And it's not easy in a network like this. And it's something that we will do as a team, but I'm not big on the next day looking at a report. I want it visible right away so they see their actions. And so, I see great opportunity in that. They're hungry to do it. They're more than motivated. And it's up to me to teach them and help them get there. And I have all the confidence in the world that's where we'll get. But we'll see just through the waste exercise at first, and then it starts to allow you to get into understanding how to devise the network to Kevin's point, to keep and even get better service and get the businesses out there. Joe Hinrichs : Yeah, Ken, I just want to add a little thing. I think the timing of Mike joining us is perfect, because we've had a year of taking advantage of the operating model that we have, engaging with our employees, do a lot of things around culture and our ONE CSX. We've made tremendous progress, especially on the service metrics, as you've seen, and we have close industry-leading metrics across the board on the operating side. Now we have Mike coming in with his experience, fresh set of eyes, and all the opportunities that can now allow us to now step back and say, \"Okay, we've come this far, great work. Proud of the team's work. Now, here's the opportunity that we have to advance even further.\" And so, the timing is perfect, I think, for us. Works out very nicely. Our team is excited and motivated. You've seen now, as Kevin has highlighted many times in his comments tonight, regarding the customers have acknowledged and they acknowledge that with me all the time, the service levels that we've sustained, almost reliably now and repeatedly for 12 months. And now we have the opportunity to get more efficient and to get even better. And Mike has come in with a great attitude and excited about how we can take it to the next level and still focus, of course, on improving our service metrics, but also teaching our team, which is a relatively young team, to understand what it takes now to take a next step forward. So, we're excited about it. I'm excited about it, and I think we can continue to outpace the industry when it comes to progress on our efficiency metrics. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Bascome Majors : Thank you. To follow up on that earlier question, can you roll that out a little bit further, not just on the service side, but Mike, your role from -- in the mandate you've been given to focus on culture, sales, the integration of Kevin's department with yours, what we, like, see different from CSX over the next three to five years versus what we've seen over the last three to five? Thank you. Mike Cory : That's a tough one, Bascome. I'm still out there trying to learn. And that's important to me because I don't want to block anybody or make them feel they can't come forward with an idea. That's number one. But going forward, I want to share the experience I have so that they're incorporating that into the things they do today. And to me, we'll see improvements in all our metrics. A bigger focus on -- when I say velocity, I'm talking both trains and cars, but fluidity. And we run a pretty condensed network here. Everything is really close. We don't have, in many cases, a lot of time to recover. So, it's the plan we put into effect and the discipline about executing it. And so, what I'm trying to share with them is the availability of data and how to use it. It hasn't -- I don't see that they've had enough time. They've gone through a pretty tough period here over the last couple of years. They've rebounded extremely nicely. And to Joe's point, this is to get to the next level, so where they're self-sufficient. And I know they can be, they know they can be, but I'm here to show them that way. And maybe Kevin, if you have something to add. Kevin Boone : Yeah, I would just -- I would highlight that the teams, Mike's team and my team, they coordinate daily. They're speaking better than they ever have to each other. It's important from a sales and marketing perspective. You talked about can we handle an upsurge in volume demand. Well, it's up to us to communicate that real time so the team can work, make sure we're prepared for that volume, communicate with a customer, and make sure it's rateable and that we have the people in place to handle it. I think a lot of the discussions we're having right now are around that. I don't think it's rocket science to figure out where things could come back very, very quickly. We're having those discussions around creating resiliency in this network. And we're going to get together in a couple of weeks, our teams again, go through it market by market. What do we see for next year? What do we see over the next three years? And how are we going to prepare for that? And those conversations are better than they ever have been. Mike Cory : Yeah, and I'll just finish up. Bascome, like -- I've been, like I said, pretty much to -- well, not pretty much everywhere, but a lot of locations. And I really focus on bringing everybody that has a role in servicing the customer. I was up in Baltimore, Curtis Bay, everybody from facilities to Kevin and his marketing team, to the people that run the plant, to our engineering, mechanical, everybody has a role to play. And when they see their actions actually doing it together, they become more than customer advocates. They know and can respond to the customer much faster because they know exactly what they can offer. And so, going forward, this is not operations and marketing. No, this is CSX. This is how we approach this. This is how we build the business and keep it and drive it even better for the customer. That's what I see in three to five years. Joe Hinrichs : You guys can't see it, but Mike has the shirt on, it's ONE CSX. That's what we're talking about here. And that's the vision that our teams are seamless enough that people see CSX as one entity, not a bunch of different functions and silos, all focused on, of course, safety first of our employees and the communities we live in and serve, but ultimately the service we provide our customers, which leads to the growth potential that we've all talked about. And it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out in this business what incremental margins come with growth in this business. But from my year-plus experience here now, we will realize the most potential when we have operations and marketing sales as described by both Kevin and Mike as one team, looking at every opportunity together with a can do, let's find a way to make sure it's profitable, let's find a way to be able to serve the customer and do it efficiently. And that's the spirit of ONE CSX, focus on how on teaching and training our employees to be part of that team and to get excited by that opportunity and do it in a way that we're proud of how we work together in service of the customer. That's ONE CSX is what everyone's talking about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Joe and team, good afternoon. Mike, welcome back. It must be pretty exciting coming, hitting the ground running and railroad showing improving service numbers. So, we look forward to seeing what you could do in 2024. My question actually is going to be to Kevin. Kevin, you had some comments. You said you had many, many reasons to be optimistic. So, I noted the two manys there. You sort of touched on domestic plastics improving. I'd like to get some meat on the bone there with those commentaries. And then, you talked a little bit about some industrial development projects with Christina. Can you give us some numbers on what you're seeing now in terms of total projects and maybe what you had a year ago and maybe pre-pandemic? Kevin Boone : Yeah. We're exposed to a lot of cyclical businesses and we're talking about \u2013 everybody is talking about a looming recession. Well, in my opinion, a lot of the businesses we touched have been in recession for the last year and many of them are at cyclical lows. And maybe we went beyond that with the de-stocking that occurred. So, when we talk about some of the plastics and we talk about forest products and some of these other markets, there's significant de-stocking headwinds that we've been dealing with for the past three, four quarters. And so just based on that, obviously, the comparisons get much easier from here as we look into 2024. And hopefully in a world where demand is relatively stable, that would implies, hopefully, some growth beyond just having the economy snap back a bit here. So that gives me a little bit of optimism. Obviously, if you turn the TV on right now, it can make you a little bit hesitant to be bullish. But the things that we can control, as I mentioned before, that pipeline has never been bigger. I don't think -- I've only been here for about six, seven years, but talking to the -- my colleagues that have been around a lot longer, the things that we're doing from an industrial development side, the things we're doing, working with other Class Is, the things -- you have the Western Class Is going after the Mexico business, we can participate in that. We're really happy to work with them. There's a lot of things, a lot of momentum just around us all working together to create opportunities for ourselves where I think for decades we've been pushing volume quite frankly off the railroad, on the truck. And now, we're all going to work collectively to really change that trend. And that's exciting. Forgot the second part of that question. The industrial projects, we did highlight a number of those. I think we'll put a fighter. We'll come back probably at the end of -- as we look into next year and kind of put up more numbers around that, but the activity levels are just tremendous. And then we haven't seen any slowdown. And like I said before, the biggest challenge is to create the inventory of readily available industrial sites that are shovel ready tomorrow, basically. As these companies, as we're seeing more on-shoring, we're seeing more industrial development. They want to go quickly and we've got to be ready to serve their needs. So that's the focus of this team is how can create more opportunities throughout our network to react to where they need to go and create a service so they can reach their customers. But we'll put some more numbers around that as we develop it, but the team has done a great job and we got a lot of momentum there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jordan Alliger : Yeah, hi. I was wondering if you could maybe give some color or thoughts around the auto sector. Obviously, it's been an area of a lot of strength, the strikes, work stoppages are going on. How much cushion do you guys have relative to the inventory that's out there versus how long this drags on before it really starts to impact carloads? Thanks. Kevin Boone : Yeah, I mean, obviously, we want a quick resolution. The quicker the better. As you're probably aware of the industry as a whole has been short on car supplies. So, to some degree that's probably helping us or helping the industry to a certain degree. There're certainly some impacts to us. We're seeing strong demand in other areas where we have a diverse portfolio. So we're able to probably supply more cars to those customers that have been wanting more cars here recently and diverting some of those as we've seen some impact. But my boss here knows that industry more than anybody else and I keep on asking him every day what his thoughts are. But we'll manage through it. I think more of this is deferred revenue. And we think the demand still remains out there. So, as we move into next year, we expect to capture all the demand that exists. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead. David Vernon : Hey, good afternoon, guys. So, Kevin, I wanted to ask you about the drivers of that domestic intermodal growth from a channel perspective. The numbers sort of turned around in week 17 and it's been pretty straightened up to the right. Is this just general stuff you're getting through traditional IMCs or is it a parcel company that's doing a little bit more over the rails? Is it a retailer that you've got a direct relationship with? Is there any one single driver of what's looking like a pretty big divergence from industry intermodal performance that we should be thinking about there in domestic intermodal? Kevin Boone : Well, I think it's not -- there's not one single driver. It's the teams working together on the operating side and the sales and marketing side. They're going after every opportunity there is. And they're -- whether it's identifying new lanes, other things that are profitable, we're going after it right now, really being able to lean in. And I have to commend the team for their creativity, their ability to work with the -- our partners in operations and really go after things and adapt quickly and react quickly to market demand out there. So, we still have a significant value proposition even with the truck as weak as it is today. And that will only accelerate once the truck firms up a little bit here in the next year. But we're really, really proud of what they've been able to accomplish and we've got a lot of momentum around it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. James McGarragle : Hey, this is James McGarragle. I'm on for Walter today. Thanks for having me on. I wanted to ask a question on U.S. port share ship toward the U.S. East Coast and away from the U.S. West Coast over the past number of years. Given the agreements with the unions on the West Coast, do you expect this share ship to trend to -- toward the East Coast to continue? And any early indication you can share from your conversations with the shipping lines and your strategy to capitalize on these trends longer term? Thanks. Sean Pelkey : I think you've heard it over and over again the West Coast are challenged in terms of being able to add capacity. And so there's been tremendous investments that continue to be made on the East Coast and we're the beneficiary of that. So, we'll continue to work with our East Coast ports and expect that trend to continue going forward. You also see a migration out of China and other markets. And that's also helpful for what we're seeing in terms of imports coming off from new locations that can go, that are more likely to go to the East Coast than maybe the West Coast previously. So, a lot of good momentum, a lot of significant investments being made. We're making investments alongside of them to make sure we're prepared for the growth, but it's been a great story that I don't see any reason that that won't continue going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good evening, everyone. Just a couple of questions here, one follow-up. Sorry if I missed this, but I was a little surprised to see the headwind on the accessorials get a little bit worse because it felt like you guys had a pretty good handle on that. Can you just kind of unpack that for us and kind of if that's now a final number? And also maybe for Joe, bigger picture, I know the rails are all trying to pivot very heavily towards growth, which has historically been challenging to come by. What do you think about inorganic growth potential opportunities maybe short-lanes, maybe trucking, like it -- is that something you guys looking at as well? Sean Pelkey : Ravi, this is Sean. I'll start with the question around the accessorial. So, it's been trending down all year long. I would say we took our kind of last sequential step down from Q2 to Q3. It's a little bit more than we expected, but it wasn't just intermodal storage. There were some other components of other revenue that were down slightly. There's a lot of different things in there from subsidiary revenue to switching charges to lots of different factors. So, this is probably a good run rate to use going forward. It is also impacted by volume to a degree. So, it'll trend to a little bit higher when the intermodal volumes recover likely. But the level that we're at right now, we do think is kind of the bottom. And that's why we just didn't want to -- we wanted to make sure everybody understood where we were headed for the fourth quarter on that line. Joe Hinrichs : Thanks, Sean. And Ravi, just a couple of other comments from your second part of your question. I mean, at the highest level, I wouldn't think that trucking is where we would see growth. We're proud of the acquisition of Quality Carriers and how that's progressed with us at CSX. But that was very specialized to serve our chemical customers where very strong franchise and very important business to us. We'll always be opportunistic, but I wouldn't say that trucking is where the growth comes from. But just a couple of areas to highlight that we haven't been highlighted so far tonight. And first and foremost, I'll start with the fact that, I think you get the sense from this team that we firmly believe that the best way to provide opportunity for growth is to continue to provide class -- best industry-leading service to our customers. And when we do that, it gives us more and more opportunities to win business with customers. So that is the foundation of where we see growth. But you have to remember, we've been investing in the New England region, which is the old Pan Am network that we purchased. And that's going to be an opportunity for growth. We're excited about that. We're going to start a new interchange point with CPKC in Myrtlewood, Alabama. We're very excited about that opportunity. And Kevin referenced it, but I want to highlight it, in order for this industry to see significant growth, we have to work better together to be motivated to serve customers in new and better ways. And we're starting to have some of those good conversations with other Class I railroads to be able to talk and think differently about how do we serve the customer and how do we get excited about that opportunity? So, there are a number of incremental steps we can take to grow the business beyond just getting better and all the work that we're doing and the cynical nature of our business, which will be some things that should help us going into '24, as both Kevin and Sean mentioned. But those are some incremental areas that we have opportunities. And then, as our intermodal product continues to get better and we continue to be in the 95%-plus trip plan compliance reliably, repeatedly, and get to the high 90%, as the truck market starts to rebound and as costs continue to increase there, we can be even more competitive versus truck and get some more business off the road there. So, a lot of opportunity for us. We have to continue down the path we're on of continuing to provide that reliable service. But there's some exciting developments going on in addition to all the projects that are going on industrial development side, as Kevin referenced earlier, we'll provide more guidance -- maybe some more information on that, not guidance, but information on the context of that. But there are hundreds and hundreds of projects in the works in that space. So, a lot to be excited about, and really excited about the capability of our network to take advantage of that.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.  I will now turn the conference over to your host, Matt Korn, Head of Investor Relations. Matt, you may begin. Matt Korn : Thank you, Krista. Hello, everyone. Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Now in the presentation accompanying this call, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2, followed by our non-GAAP disclosures on Slide 3.  And with that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs. Joe Hinrichs : Alright, thank you, Matthew, and hello everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call today. As you will hear from our leadership team today, we are very happy with the momentum we carried in the start of the New Year. Of course, Mother Nature gave us a few challenges over the last couple of weeks, but we are proud of the work our ONE CSX team has done to set us up for success this year.  Our railroad is performing well and Mike Cory and the operations team are already bringing new ideas that are helping us run even better, safer and more efficiently. Our customers are happy with the consistent service that our dedicated employees are delivering and Kevin Boone will discuss how this is translating into profitable business opportunities. Sean Pelkey will go over our financial position, which remains very strong as we continue to deliver healthy volumes, favorable pricing, strong operating margins, and high levels of free cash flow.  Before we talk about the details of the past quarter and our expectations for 2024, it is important to take a step back to appreciate all that our ONE CSX team accomplished in 2023. Everyone on this call knows it's been a very active period for our entire industry. Recall that it was just over a year ago that Congress took action to prevent a major rail strike. Soon afterwards, highly visible events last winter led to important public debates about railroad safety. And through the year, Class I railroads have completed major mergers and made significant leadership changes. Meanwhile, our customers have had to manage through higher interest rates and inflation on the one hand, and wars and supply chain disruptions on the other.  Through all of this, the aim of our ONE CSX team has been to keep moving forward on our key goal of delivering sustainable, profitable growth that benefits to all our key stakeholders, our customers, our employees, our shareholders and the communities we live in and serve. For example, CSX was the first Class I railroad to reach basically agreements with our union partners, and we were the first railroad to significantly change our attendance policies based on employee feedback. We were also the first U.S. Class I railroad to be released and additional service metric reporting by the STB back in May, based on our improvements and service to our customers.  Now here on slide five, we have listed several key achievements from this past year, and helped us take important steps forward. First and foremost, our focus on safety has driven strong results over the year, especially in the fourth quarter, enabling us to report much improved accident and injury rates compared to 2020. Our service metrics that have consistently led the industry. And today CSX remains ahead of our peers. Importantly, this is improving our customers\u2019 experience, which puts us in a great position to gain their trust and gain share.  You've heard me reiterate this all year long, our team delivered positive volume growth in merchandise that beat U.S. industrial production, improved efficiency helped us grow coal volumes, and our intermodal business gained traction led by our service and market initiatives. Our commercial and operating teams are more closely aligned than ever. Our customers know that when we offer them a solution, we have the commitment and the expertise to deliver it.  Finally, we have seen our efforts to renew the culture here the railroad start to really take shape. Through our site visits family days, and our regular surveys and town halls, we see the increased pride and energy that our employees are feeling through ONE CSX. And this is great progress. And we are proud of what we've accomplished this past year. None of these efforts are done or complete as this is a journey. There's so much more that we can accomplish as we work together as ONE CSX team.  On Slide 6, we highlight some of the key results from our fourth quarter. Total volume grew by 1%, reaching 1.56 million units in the quarter. Much of this growth was driven by our strong merchandise franchise, which gained 3% year-over-year. Our total revenue decreased by roughly 1%, 3.68 billion as the effects of higher volumes and favorable pricing were offset by a decrease in other revenue and lower fuel surcharge due to lower diesel prices, as compared to last year. We earned $0.45 per share, compared to 49% -- $0.49 per share a year ago.  With that. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Cory to go over the details of our operations. Mike Cory : Yeah, thank you, Joe. And good afternoon, everyone. Let's go to Slide 8 and let's just go to the Q4 recap. As I've said many times before, safety is foundational to every success we have. We saw a reduction in engineering and mechanical related accidents and a reduction in transportation injuries during the quarter. And I really want to thank every CSX employee for their continued efforts on creating a safe working environment for themselves and each other and that is extremely important. But we know we still have worked to do well. Though the full year numbers showed overall improvement, we were flat on transportation related accidents, and saw an increase in engineering related accidents. These are all areas of opportunities we aim to improve in 2024 and beyond. Safety at its core isn't solely about incidents, it's about how employees feel working within the organization. We have an environment where employees feel included, respected, valued and listened to, we can continue to identify areas of improvement as a team and change them. In 2023 we listened to our employees and we made positive changes to the work environment in response, converting these conversations in sound successful practices. Our results are beginning to demonstrate that this is already making a difference but we have a ways to go. We'll continue to keep this dialogue open and learn from each other.  When done right, the entire ones CSX team will meet its great potential when it comes to operating safely and efficiently and service to our customers. Over the next slide, and on this slide is pretty self-explanatory to me. It shows we've stabilized our network and we've performed pretty well over the quarter. While one of our key focus areas is on maintaining and bettering our customer facing metrics.  Our fluidity has started to allow us to look deeper at our operating plan, again to better align the hard assets needed to move the volume. The team's been focused on maximizing car connections and maximizing the train load, while at the same time reducing locomotive dwell and active horsepower on trains. As a result, we've seen both the reduction in active locomotive use and daily train start. Tighten connections standards in our yards are starting to drive changes to our operating plan that result in quicker connections. Driving a strong focus on using our locomotive technology to reduce fuel usage on line of road has contributed to a savings overall fuel cost. Altogether, we're finding tangible opportunities to open up more capacity on this network. I expect these metrics to continue to improve as we go forward.  Moving over to Slide 10. And I really believe we've made good headway in Q4 and especially over 2023. Our key metrics continue to improve in our network fluid. Our headcount is at the point that we're now able to manage through efficiency and attrition. We\u2019re paying close attention to resource requirements for any new business coming online when needed. Our focus on car connections and train tonnage closely matched horsepower along with network fluidity allowed us to reduce 2.5% of our daily starts in the quarter and start to store active locomotives. Among other things, this coming quarter, we'll be performing full territory reviews with our team that will further improve our customer service and continue to identify opportunities to better align asset use. And of course, we'll be working right along with Kevin and his sales and marketing team to deliver this great service and grow with our customers.  During closing, during my four months on the property, I continue to learn more about this network and especially the women and men that make up this tremendous ONE CSX team. I'm extremely excited about our potential to deliver our customers better service with greater safety, efficiency and teamwork.  I'm excited to do this together as one group of great railroaders. So thanks for the time. Over to you, Kevin. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Mike. It really has been great to see how well our teams have been working together and the positive momentum we are building with our customers, as they recognize CSX\u2019s focused on service. The teamwork is allowing us to build on new opportunities and drive attractive and profitable growth across all of our end markets. Business conditions in 2023 were challenging for many of our customers, with some of our key markets experiencing volatility driven by a number of factors, including inventory destocking.  On the positive side, we saw many of these markets show improvement in the fourth quarter, which combined with our industry-leading service provides optimism that the team can deliver strong revenue growth.  Turning to Slide 12, look at our merchandise performance. As you can see, our revenues were up 5% on both a quarterly and annual basis. Even with the effects of reduced fuel surcharge. Volume increased by a solid 3% for the quarter, and 2% for the full year -- excuse me, outpacing domestic industrial production that's been effectively flat. And we've delivered pricing results that reflect the higher inflationary backdrop that we've all experienced.  Looking at the details of the quarter, automotive performed well, even with a temporary disruption caused by the UAW strike, as total volumes held up and we continue to see leverage, and we continue to leverage service to gain new business. Chemicals was challenged over most of the year, but delivered positive growth in the fourth quarter driven by shipments in plastics, sand and waste. For fertilizers, strong domestic demand and higher CSX shipments of potash exports supported volumes. Short haul phosphate shipments remains constrained by supply issues, which weighs on volumes but provides a tailwind for yields.  Metals has continued to be an area where our service provided growth opportunities. And in minerals, infrastructure related demand continue to be very healthy over the quarter, with new cement production supporting volumes. For forest products volumes was modestly lower year over year, but increased sequentially, as cardboard demand has started to show signs of recovery. While the ramp up in ag and food over the fourth quarter was challenged, with southeastern feed buyers remaining well supplied from local crops, combined with slower ramp up in exports. Now, as we head into 2024 we are encouraged with the momentum we built across the business and we see many opportunities across the end markets we serve. Our Service continues to differentiate CSX in the marketplace, and we are excited about the opportunities this offers us to work with customers to collectively grow our businesses together.  Turning to Slide 13. Coal revenue decreased 1% for the fourth quarter as we lapped very strong export pricing from a year ago. Volumes remained positive, growing by 3% for the quarter, and 8% for the year. Our coal business continues to be strong, with service levels accelerating in the fourth quarter, and global export prices supporting U.S. production. At the end of the last quarter, we indicated that export demand remained strong that lower natural gas prices and reduced restocking demand would likely weigh on domestic shipments. And that's exactly what happened in the fourth quarter, with export tonnage up a full 27% while domestic tonnage declined by 13%. Coal RPU of just over 3,200 per ton was up 5% sequentially in line with our expectations. For the New Year, we are optimistic, supported by continued strength and export demand, as global benchmarks for both met and thermal we currently remain at half healthy levels. We also see incremental production growth on our network in West Virginia, which will primarily be focused on the export market.  Domestic demand in 2023 was supported by months of aggressive restocking at utilities and a very hot summer. With stockpiles at more normal levels demand upside will largely be dependent on weather conditions in 2024. That said, total electricity demand growth remains substantial, especially in the Southeast, driven by new industrial capacity to data centers, achieving EV charging stations. Turning to Slide 14. Fourth quarter intermodal revenue decreased 4% on flat volumes. For the full year, revenue decreased 11% on volumes that were down 7%. Lower fuel surcharge drove the largest impact to yields. Our domestic intermodal business continued to perform well, with volume increasing sequentially and growing in the mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. We saw growth with our key partners that continue to experience industry-leading service performance, which was recently highlighted in JOCs customer satisfaction results.  Our ability to deliver domestic growth was an extraordinary team effort, especially given the significant challenges facing the trucking market. In International, volumes were lower compared to last year, but we were encouraged to see improvement each month with December actually showing modest year-over-year growth as the positive effects of more normalized retailer inventories gain traction. Our team has continued to work hard to maximize our opportunities, which showed up in the growth as we work to build new partnerships, create new service offerings and leverage higher activity at the inland ports that we serve.  Positive market trends are taking shape as we head into 2024, and we expect the combination of a more supportive market, new conversion opportunities and service offerings to drive year-over-year growth in both the domestic and the international business. We continue to monitor the evolving situations at both the Panama Canal and the Red Sea. To date, we have not been significantly affected by any changes in our customer behavior but we stand at the ready with the capacity and capabilities to adapt as needed. Finally, as we turn the page to 2024, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead. The team is accelerating our efforts in many areas of our business to work hand-in-hand with our customers to identify areas for growth. From industrial development to identifying market-specific operating metrics that enhance the customer experience. Team has been working closely with our rail partners to unlock growth. These are just a few of the focus areas for the team.  Now I'll hand it over to Sean to review the financial review. Sean Pelkey : Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon. Fourth quarter revenue fell by 1%, while operating income was down 10% or $139 million. Now these results include $180 million of discrete year-over-year impacts from declines in other revenue, real estate gains and export coal benchmark prices. However, the underlying results also reflect the benefit of our sustained service levels throughout 2023 and growing momentum in the business. Across merchandise, coal and intermodal, revenue excluding fuel increased by 5%, benefiting from strong core pricing across the merchandise portfolio and 3% volume growth in both merchandise and coal. Counter to normal seasonal trends, the team delivered sequential volume gains, helping operating income increased by $25 million relative to the third quarter. Interest and other expense was $16 million higher compared to the prior year. Income tax expense decreased $23 million, the effective tax rate of 22.9% included $19 million of favorable adjustments primarily for state tax matters relative to $33 million of favorable adjustments in the prior year. Our expected tax rate going forward remains 24.5%. Earnings per share fell by $0.04, including $0.07 of impact from the previously mentioned discrete items. For the full year, operating income fell by 8% or $462 million, while earnings per share was 5% lower. These results were impacted by the prior year Virginia real estate transaction declining intermodal storage revenue and lower export coal benchmarks totaling nearly $700 million on a combined basis. The hard work of our ONE CSX team provided our customers reliable and consistent service throughout 2023, and laid a strong foundation for long-term profitable growth. With profitable growth in mind, we will also be making a change in how we report results going forward. Starting in the first quarter of 2024 and we will transition to a more conventional approach of reporting operating margins rather than operating ratio. Our goal is to target margin improvement, aligning the business around a balanced approach that includes profitable volume gains and pricing to the value of our service, all while controlling costs and optimizing asset utilization.  Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at fourth quarter expenses. Total fourth quarter expense increased by $89 million as the impacts of lower real estate gains, inflation, increased depreciation and higher head count were partly offset by lower fuel prices and efficiency savings in PS&O and rents.  Turning to the individual line items. Labor and Fringe was up $82 million, impacted by inflation and additional headcount. The quarter also included costs that related to the timing of union employee vacation and sick benefits. We expect this to adjust down resulting in a lower sequential cost per employee in the first quarter. Purchased services and other expense increased $4 million versus last year, as inflation was mostly offset by savings from our intermodal and engineering teams. We expect a modest sequential increase in the first quarter, similar to what we have seen in recent years. As a reminder, we'll cycle a prior year insurance recovery of nearly $50 million in the first quarter. And while we expect increased technology carry costs and a need for more locomotive overhauls to impact expense in 2024, we are actively implementing cost savings and efficiency initiatives that will help offset these headwinds.  Depreciation was up $24 million, including an $11 million adjustment related to prior periods. We are projecting roughly $40 million to $50 million higher full year depreciation expense in 2024. Fuel cost was down $59 million driven by a lower gallon price. While fuel efficiency was stable year-over-year, we saw strong sequential improvement. These results are especially encouraging as we typically face seasonal efficiency headwinds in the fourth quarter. Mike and the team expect to continue the momentum in this critical measure into 2024 and drive meaningful year-over-year savings. Equipment and rents was $9 million favorable, driven by faster car cycle times across all markets. Finally, property gains were $47 million unfavorable in the quarter. At this time, we do not expect any individually significant transactions during 2024.  Now turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 18. Full year free cash flow remains strong at $3.3 billion. Our first priority use of cash remains investing for the safety, reliability and growth of our business. As such, this figure includes $2.3 billion of capital spend across a wide range of projects to ensure the integrity of our network infrastructure as well as the high return strategic investment opportunities.  Looking to 2024, note that free cash flow will be impacted by about $380 million of Federal Cash Tax Payments that were deferred from 2023. Cash flow generation also supported close to $4.4 billion in shareholder returns for the year, including $3.5 billion in share repurchases and nearly $900 million of dividends. While economic profit finished lower for the year, largely due to lower intermodal storage revenue and export coal pricing, our goal is to increase economic profit over time which has been shown to strongly correlate with outsized shareholder returns. With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. Joe Hinrichs : All right. Thank you, Sean. Now we will conclude with our initial thoughts on our expectations for the full year 2024. As of today, and based on our visibility with our customers and our expectations for the CSX specific initiatives that we are putting in place, we anticipate growth in total volume and total revenue in the low to mid-single digit range. We see encouraging momentum across our merchandise business, but we are benefiting from service-led gains in market share and wallet share and new industrial development activity. We expect growth in our intermodal business as a prolonged destocking cycle finally winds down and our strategic initiatives continue to drive volume, and Export coal demand continues to be very strong with CSX gaining from the ramp-up of a new mine on our network. By growing volumes and utilizing our existing capacity, we expect our profitability to benefit from a favorable combination of solid pricing better operational efficiency and a moderate easing in cost inflation. Kevin's team continues to do a great job making sure that we are getting paid for the service we provide. And as Mike discussed, we see all kinds of new opportunities run this network better, safer, faster and more efficiently. We expect an increase in our capital spending to approximately $2.5 billion this year as we invest in safety infrastructure, locomotive rebuilds, upgrades to our portion of the New Alabama Interchange with CBKC and other specific high-return investments, including technology investments. Finally, as before, there is no change to our balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns, using our excess cash to fund share repurchases and dividends to benefit our shareholders.  In closing, I am very proud of what our entire team accomplished this past year. To our ONE CSX team, I want to thank all of you across all of our facilities in every state and province that we're operating in, through your hard work and for demonstrating that our ONE CSX culture can be something real and impactful. We're in a great position we had in 2024 and with your help, we can make it even better year than the strong one we just had. For everyone on this call, thank you for all your interest in and support of CSX. Matthew, we're now ready to take questions. Matt Korn : Thank you, Joe. We will now move to our question-and-answer session. In the interest of time and to make sure that everyone on this call has an opportunity to take part, we ask you to please limit yourselves to one and only one question. Krista, we're ready to start the process. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Chappell from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Chappell : Thank you and good afternoon. Sean, I wanted to dig a little deeper on this part of the guide and maybe some of the delayed productivity improvements that you spoke about. If the volume commentary is low to mid-single digit, you have some of the productivity levers that you were hoping to pull even though you have some of these, I guess, other fixed cost increases in the form of D&A, et cetera. How do you think about margin expansion in 2024 based on your base case of volume and revenue? Sean Pelkey : Thanks, Jonathan. That's a bit of a loaded question, a lot in there. Well, I'll do my best. I think when I step back our target is to always expand margins, and we can do that by growing the business profitably, operating safely and running an efficient railroad.  When I think about 2024 and sort of how that year progresses, we built some momentum coming from Q3 into Q4. We grew volumes. We grew operating income. That's not always the case. Our hope is to continue that momentum going into the first quarter, whether or not withstanding here. And then build that momentum into the second quarter as well. We've got some headwinds year-over-year that we can talk about in the first quarter. They began to ease in the second quarter. And then by the time we get to the second half of the year, the comps are a little bit easier, and that's where I think you'll really see some very strong incremental margins. John Chappell : Thanks, Sean. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Bascome Majors : Joe, you opened the call talking about a lot of the progress you had made in your first year leading the business. Can you talk about how your focus or at least investors will see your focus involved over the next 12 to 18 months following the success you've had improving a lot of stakeholder relationships in your first 16? Joe Hinrichs : Yeah. Thanks, Bas. And I think you heard a little bit of that in, on the commentary from the team here. We now see our business has stabilized. We've reached a threshold on customer service that has been recognized in the industry, and now you're seeing the opportunity for us to take advantage of that stability to get more efficient.  We're now at the manpower levels that we were targeting. There's always going to be some needs here or there. But generally speaking, we're the manpower levels we were targeting. So we head into 2024 with an opportunity to be in a much more stable setting the momentum we're building on culture and how people are working together. Mike coming in and his perspective and working closely with Kevin and his team, I feel really good about the opportunity going forward now is for us to leverage the strength we have in our operating model and the people we have to get more efficient.  Obviously, we want to see more safety improvement this year as we saw in the fourth quarter of last year and building momentum there, and then take advantage of the opportunity to grow with our customers. We now have over a year of providing stable, persistent, reliable service that our customers are recognizing us for. And we have the opportunity now to talk to each one of them about, okay, what can we do together to grow and how can we work together? The journey on efficiency, safety, culture never ends, and we're going to keep working together. But I will tell you, we come into 2024, our network was in good shape, very good shape. Our manpower levels are in good shape. The team is working better together than I\u2019ve seen it in the time I\u2019ve been here. And so that gives us confidence that we can build on the momentum we\u2019ve established over the last year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Oseenbeck from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a quick follow-up for Sean first. Can you just give us the commentary about the comp per employee stepping down into the first quarter after the increase in 4Q? And then maybe for Mike, can you just give us a sense in terms of what you're seeing? I know it's still little bit early, but a little bit further down the path over the last call, it sounds like fuel efficiency is an area for some big improvement that you're targeting. Maybe some more network in taking out some of the locomotives as the fluidity continues to improve. So what are you seeing there and maybe some rough order of magnitude would be helpful? Thank you. Sean Pelkey : Sure, Brian. I'll begin on the copper employees. So we did have some true-ups in terms of vacation and sick leave that I mentioned in the quarter. That was probably about $15 million. We also had work that moved from capital into OE. We typically have that in the fourth quarter. So those will both be tailwinds going into the first quarter on comp per employee. So I would expect if you're modeling that a couple of percentage point improvement versus what we reported in Q4. Should be pretty steady in the first half. And then again, we have that 4% wage increase scheduled in July, so probably step up a little bit in the second half of the year. Notwithstanding the efficiency initiatives that Mike and the team are focused on. Operator : Your next question -- Mike Cory : Sorry. I was just going to finish up. Look, overall asset use, whether it's locomotives, trains we run, how productive all of us are, they're front and center for what we look at. And so for me, it's really, I'd say out of a scale out 1 to 10, I'm about a 4 in terms of where I am in understanding our network and understanding our people. However, we're really starting to focus in on the things that aren't working right. They aren't working against what we think we can do with the franchise, with the network we have. So whether it's size of trains, the state of the train, the use of the technology we have to get the most out of the locomotive. It's just, right now, it's blocking and tackling, and it's everybody coming together. So we're learning, we're teaching we're sharing best practices. We're doing the things that, in that fourth quarter was really the last couple of months that we really started to see the things we could do because, first of all, we had the head count. We had the reliability and the fluidity of the network.  And so we\u2019re just going to keep grinding that stone. But as I said in my remarks, we\u2019re going to really get deep into the operating plans over every corridor over the next few quarters. And I\u2019ll leave that charge, but I tell you what, I\u2019ve got a lot of people that are that are out there ready to go and they\u2019re very qualified to do this. So I see, to Sean\u2019s point, we got further efficiency ahead of us, but never at the expense of safety and never at the expense of customer service. So our hope is that we continue to provide this great product and the customers are going to come. And that\u2019s how we\u2019ll also get the efficiency that we need. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Justin Long : Thanks, good afternoon. So with the 2024 guidance being the same for volumes and revenue, low to mid-single digit growth. Is it right to think that your assumption for revenue per unit all-in is flattish? And either way, I was wondering if you could provide some more color on your expectations for coal RPU maybe for the first quarter and then the full year as well? Thanks. Kevin Boone : Hey, Justin, this is Kevin. I think you hit on it right there on the coal RPU. Obviously, very healthy market right now, how much you embed that going forward? We're optimistic, but we know this market can move around quite a bit. And so maybe a little bit of conservative outlook as we move through the year. Hopefully, there's some upside to that, but that's largely impacting it, as you mentioned, from an RPU perspective.  The other thing that I would highlight is we do expect the intermodal market to bounce back here, and that's a lower RPU business as well, but that will be contributory to our growth this year from a volume and revenue perspective. So lower ARPU overall. So that will mix it down a bit. But those are the two large factors that you just highlighted and you know about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Group : Hey, thanks, afternoon. So I want to just dig into the cost side a little bit. So if I just look, I understand some noise with vacations and paid sick but cost ex fuel up about 3% to 4% from Q3 with volume up less than 1%. So it's just, we've seen a lot of cost creep that continued in Q4. I guess, ultimately, I'm trying to figure out where do we go from here? Can we start to see overall cost levels stabilize? Do they still increase, but increase just at a slower pace? Is there any chance they could start to come down a little bit? I don't know. I'm just struggling with how to think about the cost side. So any help there? Sean Pelkey : Yeah. Thanks, Scott. I can take a stab at it here. So I think fourth quarter, let's remember, we've got the dynamic of some work moving off of capital and going to OE. That's normal. We'll typically see a little bit of a step-up that reverses back in Q1. We probably had, call it, $30 million, $35 million of costs in the quarter that were somewhat unusual items that we mentioned but just as a reminder, we had a true-up on vacation and sick leave, that was about $15 million, as I just mentioned. We had another $10 million on depreciation true-up at the end of the year there for that, that's not going to recur. And then the Livingston, Kentucky derailment was about $10 million as well. So you kind of add all that together, those costs roll off as we go into the first quarter.  And then we built some momentum. I mean, as Mike said, he\u2019s already looked at the train plan. He\u2019s reduced some starts driving tonnage up. That\u2019s going to drive fuel efficiency as well, taking some locomotives out. We\u2019re not paying maintenance on those locomotives. So we\u2019re certainly building some momentum. I think that\u2019s going to gradually add in as we go through the year. And that\u2019s why I feel really good about where the incrementals are going to be second half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah, good afternoon. Wanted to ask, I think it's probably for Kevin, just a little bit on the revenue side. You've had a pretty meaningful storage revenue headwind in 2023. And I think you feel surcharge can be an impact too. How do you think about those two factors as you go in '24? Are they kind of neutral? Or is there still some lingering headwind?  And then in terms of price, what kind of a price assumption do you have? Are you thinking stable pricing versus what we got in '23? Or is it kind of up or down? Thank you. Sean Pelkey : Yeah. So just on the first part of the question, Tom, I'll answer that. On the other revenue piece, we're, I would go ahead and model something like $130 million a quarter, which is kind of what we've been running at the second half of this year. Obviously, you do the math on that, it will be a big headwind in Q1 about, call it, $50 million plus. That's why the comps are tougher in Q1 and then a little less in Q2 before we get to the normalized rate. And then on fuel, don't forget, we had a pretty favorable lag impact in the first half of last year to the tune of almost $70 million across the first and second quarter. So prices have come down a little bit. We are expecting somewhat favorable lag in Q1 of this year, but it's still be a year-over-year headwind. So those are two reasons why we're thinking about more sequential momentum in the first quarter as opposed to being able to deliver growth until we get to the second half of the year. Kevin Boone : Yeah. And then on pricing, I think, as we talked about all last year, we had to react to a much higher inflation environment that we all experienced, quite frankly. And, you'll see a lot of that carryover, right? These contracts are negotiated some on a multiyear period, some year-over-year. We know how to negotiate every year. So it's fair to say our expectation coming into '24 is cost inflation for our business will be a little bit lower. So I would expect that number to come down when we have our conversations but still very healthy when you look at historical rates, what we were able to achieve. And obviously, that's an important part of our revenue growth story is both volume balanced approach between volume and price. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, I wonder if you could speak more specifically to labor efficiency this year, especially in reference to Kevin's remarks that you're going to have new merchandise business bringing on about a point of volume additionally. So how are you planning for headcount? And what are the opportunities for efficiency there? Thank you. Mike Cory : Hey, Brandon, I hope you're well. Look, I'm not going to say at this stage that we can add incremental volume without headcount. It depends on what it is and where it's at. But I'm very comfortable with the results we had in a run rate of more train size. And that obviously reduces the impact on the headcount. We've got areas that we just haven't got to in my time yet. And I think the -- and this isn't just about trade and size, but we really, we have a very customer-intensive network. And so we have a lot of yards and locals and first of all, we're looking to button down and make the service reliable.  And with the head count we have right now, we see that we're able to do it. So that leads us to know that we can do better. And so I see the opportunities really in the touches of the cars that we do today. So I see further incremental improvement. I see the ability with the capacity we're creating with the locomotives that we've got added to the storage count to the capacity we created online by having less movements. I see us being able to handle incremental volume with what we have in many cases. But again, there are those key areas we want to make sure that we have the right head count for. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ken Hoexter : Great, good afternoon. So just, I guess, thinking about the performance there, either Mike or Joe, it looked like your on-time origination is down at 71% on-time arrivals at 69%. What is still missing from the operations to get that efficiency improving? Have you changed the categories at all to see those sliding since the beginning of the year? Maybe just what are your thoughts on how that gets increased efficiency to get those additional operating leverage savings? Mike Cory : Yeah, thanks, Ken. It just goes back to what I'm talking about in our yards and our terminal performance, and that's where our focus will be. Again, I've been getting the folks to really focus on connecting cars, increasing train size. So we're going through some growth periods in that sense. Yeah, it's affecting the on-time performance. But at the end of the day, we're counting on making sure we fulfill the trip plan of the customer, and in some cases, it's going to change the way we design our network and the time the trains go.  So I'm not concerned about that at this stage. It certainly isn't anything to do with congestion or poor performance. These are the growing, the growth what I call, growth observations of a network that's starting to change and really look to more maximize the assets that we have out there to create capacity. So it\u2019s not a cause of concern at this moment. Trust me, we look at it in a lot, measured at the minute. So this isn\u2019t, it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve got trains that are late, late, late. These are fractions of hours. And so that\u2019s fine. We know we have to operate on time. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s the delivery to the customer. It\u2019s their first mile, last miles, their pain points that we\u2019re focused on. And at the same time, we\u2019re driving efficiency through running a more condensed network. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe I just wanted to follow up on the Resources question. I guess, as you think about the portfolio of the business opportunities ahead of you that informs the volume growth outlook. Can that be done? Or what are the resources required, I guess, as you think about the plans? When we think about headcount, maybe specifically, but maybe also locomotives, what is the growth associated with that that you guys have in the plan for 2024? Sean Pelkey : Yeah. I mean, Chris, one thing to just think about is we added head count through the year in 2023, right? So if we just held everything flat to where we ended the year last year, would be up 2% year-over-year with a little bit more of that year-over-year growth in the first half than in the second half. I think our view right now is that, by and large, with a couple of exceptions, we should be able to hold head count flat and absorb the new growth that's coming on in the network. And so we'll be able to do that. First quarter, it won't look like tremendous employee efficiency just because we added through the year last year, we get into the second half of the year. I think that's where you're going to see the labor productivity show up. Mike Cory : Yeah. And just on top of that, too, Chris. Staying with locomotives, where we still have opportunity to use the locomotives we have out there working, use them harder. And so that\u2019s a big focus for us, whether it\u2019s dwell, whether it\u2019s connection, whether it\u2019s what they\u2019re pulling, I believe we have the capacity to grow just of what we have out there right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mahrotra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, Operator. Hi, everybody. So, Sean, can you just help us, I guess, calibrate 1Q expectations in terms of operating ratio. You talked about $30 million to $35 million of kind of one-timers in the fourth quarter. I think that's like a point of OR. Volume is down, I guess, a little over 6%. So that's obviously a headwind weather is tough. So just talk about that.  And then on the cost side, PS&O costs, there's a lot of focus on labor. Again, it's your biggest cost bucket, but PS&O is a pretty large bucket. And if I look over the last three to four years, the rate of inflation in PS&O costs are like more than double revenue growth. What's going on there? What's the opportunity to kind of hold the line or bring that down? Because if I remember correctly, back in '17- '18 was really a great place to look for efficiency and opportunity. I just want to know if there's an opportunity there in '24 as well. Sean Pelkey : Amit, on your Q1 margin question, I think I'll just sort of stick to what I said before in terms of building momentum from Q4 to Q1. That's our goal. It's to deliver if we can, operating income growth sequentially from Q4 to Q1. The margins will be what they are based on what, where fuel prices settle. But can we grow margins as well in Q1. Sure. I think that's within the realm of possibility.  Again, whether or notwithstanding, we had a rough couple of weeks we're coming out of that, things are certainly looking better across the network as we speak. So you'll see the weekly volumes and see how that catches up from there.  In terms of your comment on PS&O, I think it's a good reminder for everybody to go back and understand we added quality carriers a couple of years ago, a significant portion of the expenses within quality shows up in the PS&O line. And that is quite volume variable. And so, as we see increases or decreases in the trucking revenue line, that's going to impact PS&O expense as well.  We also added PanAm. There are PS&Operator expenses associated with the revenue that we added across that part of the network as well. And then PS&Operator can also be somewhat volume driven, particularly on the intermodal side, the terminal related expenses show up there on that line. So what I said was going from Operator4 to Operator1 on PS&Operator like we normally do, we would expect a little bit of a sequential increase in those costs and have no doubt, we are certainly focused on that line item amongst others as an area of opportunity to continue to drive cost savings. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good evening. I just want to go back to the commentary on domestic intermodal specifically around truck conversion. It does seem like we're still really early stages. I would love to get your perspective on what can drive that acceleration in some of those conversions? Is it your reliability improving further? Is it better truck capacity? Just anything, any comments there on what could drive that acceleration of the space at this point? Kevin Boone : Yeah. I would think, I've heard many characterize last year as maybe the worst trucking market they've seen in the last 40 years. So I think there's a lot of hope that we're at the bottom or have reached the bottom. I will say, and we've been recognized and I highlighted this in the opening comments, the customers are seeing the service levels that we're delivering. And I know Mike has plans to even improve some of our true terminal fluidity even further.  We're looking at ways where we're going to measure the customer experience in a different way. Measure their truck on time terminal and all those things that really are important for those customers that drive value for their customers, quite frankly. So a lot of those initiatives are underway, and that gives us a lot of confidence as we move forward through the year that not only hopefully the market has bottomed, but on top of that, that we\u2019re going to be able to gain share with the service product that we\u2019re able to deliver. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Vernon : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So Sean, I think you called out, I think it was like $280 million or $380 million of deferred tax headwinds and $300 million of extra CapEx. I just want to confirm I got that $600 million headwind to cash flow rate for the year?  And then as we think about timing, Sean, you were very clear about incrementals being better in the back half than the front half. Kevin, can you share anything on the rate at which you'd expect this single, low to mid-single digit sort of volume and revenue to show up? Is that also back-end loaded? Or how do we think about the cadence for the year? Thank you. Sean Pelkey : Yeah, David, I'll start. So on your question there, Yeah. So deferred tax, $380 million, which was essentially a benefit to 2023. We will make that payment in the first half of 2024. And then on the CapEx, basically going from 2.3 to 2.5 million, so that's about a $200 million increase on that side. Kevin Boone : Yeah. In terms of the cadence from a volume and revenue perspective, I think we've been clear in that first quarter, some coal dynamics, other things from a pricing perspective or probably the high watermark that we'll have to lap, but pretty even cadence through the year after that. You'll probably remember, we started to see some weakness into the second quarter on the industrial side of our business. And when you think about chemicals and our forest products business, in particular, some very strong, weakness that started to occur that we were, that will begin the lap quite frankly, as we get into the second quarter, late second quarter and third and fourth. So, but when we look across the year, we think we\u2019re able to achieve growth throughout the year. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ravi Shanker : Guys, just got only one. Maybe just a follow-up on that, kind of just on the operating leverage itself, I mean in theory, shouldn't we be seeing kind of the bulk of the operating leverage kind of show up now as we come off the floor of volumes and kind of you have the maximum fixed cost absorption? And kind of the follow-up question to that is, if the market stays softer for longer in 2024, and truck rates continue to be competitive, do you think the volumes that you guys are converting will be enough to drive that operating leverage? Or do you also need price to come on top of that? Sean Pelkey : Yeah, Ravi. So on the operating leverage point, I would say that the leverage is there underlying the business, right? We've had some discrete headwinds that I mentioned in the script. And as we go into the first half of this year, Q1, you got fuel lag from last year, you have other revenue coming down. You've got an insurance recovery. Those are things that we're going to have to lap and get behind us and then a little bit of a tail into Q2 as well, which is why in the second half, on a reported basis, you'll see it show up a lot more cleanly. In terms of the macro, I think, yeah, we feel pretty confident about our ability to grow even in the face of a macro that's relatively flat. We have some business wins that are carryover, got some new business that's coming online, and we should be able to absorb most of that with the existing resources, if not tighten up the plan a little bit and save some costs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Walter Spracklin : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. So I wanted to go back to the coal forecast. I know you mentioned in your remarks here that domestic coal is expected to be modestly impacted. And when we're comparing it to other sources, EIA, you're saying U.S. production is going to be down 16% in 2024, and that's on the back of solar and the retirement of coal-fired capacity. Is this just a different market? Like is the retirement of coal-fired capacity just not in your catchment area? Is it, what would lead to such a disparity between that kind of forecast and the one that you're providing here on the domestic coal front? Kevin Boone : Yeah, Walter, we all read your notes here. Obviously, we've been intimately looking at that, and we have our own sources. But we do a bottoms-up build up, right? We look at, we talk to our customers. We understand what the demand they're seeing in their business, how they're forecasting, what they're telling their investors and their stakeholders in terms of what they're seeing. And quite frankly, this market right now is still a production -- production is going to either decide our upside or limit our upside. It's not, we don't see a demand -- demand right now where it is impacting our volumes next year. It's really a production-constrained market from everything that we're seeing.  We see some weakness in the domestic market. We think there is an export market that can continue to put some of that volume into that market. So there is optimism. Obviously, I know this market can change quite quickly. The global environment changes quickly. But for what we see right now and what our customers are telling us, and, there will be some weather impact as we get into the year, we'll look at the summer to see if it's hotter than usual or where that shakes out, that will obviously impact our domestic business, but we do think there's an export business that as an outlet for some of the domestic side if we saw some further weakness there. Operator : We have no further questions in our queue. And with that, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Brianna and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Corporation First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Matthew Korn : Thank you, Brianna. Hello everyone and good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President, and Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In presentation accompanying this call, you will find slides with our forward-looking disclosure and our non-GAAP disclosures for your review. With that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs. Joe Hinrichs : All right. Thank you, Matthew. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter call. CSX had a solid start to 2024 that was in line with our expectations. I've learned that when it comes to routing, it never really is an easy quarter. And this year has already brought us a number of challenges. Thankfully, we have a great ONE CSX team of over 23,000 people. And as you've seen in our weekly volume performance, our railroad has kept moving forward after the early periods of severe weather in January. The latest incident, of course, has been the tragic Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. CSX had a deep historical relationship with Baltimore and we have important operations there, particularly with our export coal business. We're committed to doing our part to help the city recover. We are happy to see the progress already being made for reopening the port. Later in the call, Mike Cory and Kevin Boone will tell you more about what we are doing now to mitigate the impact of this event for our customers. All that said, we are very pleased with the momentum that we built over the quarter and are seeing in the business today. We knew we had the opportunity to grow our profitability compared to the fourth quarter and we did just that. Our goal was to maintain our strong customer service levels while looking for ways to run the network more efficiently and we have done so. We have more work to do and we are confident in our railroad and are excited about the rest of the year. Now let's start with Slide 1 where we highlight some of the key results from our first quarter. Total volume grew by a solid 3% with strong support from our international -- our intermodal business franchise, which grew at 7% compared to last year. Our operating margin reached 36.8%, which represents a 90 basis point improvement compared to the fourth quarter. Revenue of just under $3.7 billion was about 1% lower than a year ago and flat compared to last quarter. Operating income was 8% lower than last year, but up 3% sequentially. While our earnings per share declined by 4% versus last year, EPS grew by 2% compared to the previous quarter. Now altogether, this was a good first quarter that reflected our solid progress. The entire ONE CSX team knows that there's much more that we can achieve given all the opportunities ahead and the great people we have across the entire railroad. But before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and remember Jim Foote, who passed away earlier this week. Jim was our President and CEO from late December, 2017, until I arrived in September of 2022. He guided this company through some very challenging and transformative times in our history, including rebuilding the network after the dramatic changes in 2017 and dealing with the COVID pandemic. I had several impactful and insightful conversations with Jim while I was being recruited to come to CSX. And I thank Jim for his support with our Board of Directors to bring an outsider in as CEO of CSX. We thank Jim for all his contributions to CSX and the railroad industry overall throughout his 40-plus year career. And our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends. Now let me turn the call over to Mike Cory who has brought a tremendous amount of new energy and new ideas to CSX to discuss our operational performance. Mike Cory : Yeah, thank you, Joe, and thanks for everybody for taking the time to be with us today. So let's look at the first slide on safety. While we found improvement in the FRA train accident rate year-over-year, in my view, our overall performance results in this quarter pale in comparison to what this team is capable and will deliver. So as a team we've begun to really work collectively to elevate and integrate the beliefs and actions that a strong safety culture requires. We recognize that in order to successively change our safety performance, we need different and better skills. This includes proactive risk identification for our employees and their supervisors. And we thoroughly investigate every incident to determine the root cause and the necessary follow-ups for any recurrence. And we pass that information on to our employees through portals to ensure the information is shared, learned from, and used in improving everything from training to oversight of all our employees. [Technical Difficulty] employees in both the union and their management provide a key opportunity to build a strong safety culture. We're starting to partner with our union leaders to help us change risk tolerances across our property. And this partnership is starting to provide real benefit toward creating a strong safety culture. This takes time and effort on all sides, but I'm very pleased with our progress so far. We're also listening to our employees' suggestions and we're applying it to our safety plan in order to become more responsive to our customers\u2019 needs in a safe and efficient way. Let's look at the next slide. And looking at this slide, you're going to see our standard velocity and dwell metrics that I'm sure we'll talk about today. Our focus this quarter has been on providing strong customer service while controlling costs. And while we've seen a slight decrease in velocity and an increase in dwell, our train sizes have grown in line with the increase in volume we've handled for our customers year-over-year. Crew starts have remained flat with GTMs up 1.5% and carloads up 3%. Our cost focus also includes management of the large capital program we have our engineering crews working on. And we're focused on making sure they have enough time for the work to be done properly. As a result, our crews are accomplishing all of their scheduled work and are also gaining efficiency. In both [tie] (ph) and rails, we've seen reductions in unit costs, good reductions. As we've enforced stricter compliance with planned track time for crews, we've seen slight decreases in velocity increases as well. Our intent is to build and execute a more inclusive plan that provides the right work window while minimizing loss of velocity. And I expect to see improvement as we continue to refine and develop this plan for the rest of this year cycle and beyond. Our focus on cost has also identified some strategic locations that are not as productive as they could be. We see cost saving opportunities by reconfiguring and strategically utilizing these assets into our operating plan. This will reduce cars running out of route and excess handlings, and our customers will benefit as we increase speed and open up capacity in one of the corridors. And that's the most important part. It is we make these changes to our operation. There's no change to our goal of servicing the customer the best way we can. Having an efficient network that can consistently perform to our customers needs will allow us to gain share, and build business from truck and attract new customers to rail. Over to the next slide. On this slide, you're going to see some of our customer service metrics, which still remains strong. Intermodal trip plan compliance remains high. Truck drive return times and arrival to availability, which is a measure of efficiency at the yard, has also improved as we collaborate with our customers to improve the experience of their terminals. As an example, our Fairburn terminal, southeast of Atlanta, is a critical asset for our domestic intermodal business, but has not performed to our customers' needs as well as our expectations. Our intermodal leader put together a team and they developed better process for use of both the footprint and the assets, in turn creating fluidity that has reduced driver dwell at Fairburn by nearly 50% in recent weeks compared to earlier in the year and previous to that. This leads to capacity and more opportunity for conversion from truck. Our carload trip compliance declined slightly, but remained over 80% for the quarter and has improved in the first month of Q2. We're very proud of the service that our customers experience with CSX. To show this, we've added another important metric to this slide, and that's customer switch data, which represents our reliability to be able to deliver on our commitments at the first and last mile of service for our customers and most of our short-line partners. As you can see, this remains very high. In closing, we have many opportunities ahead of us. The team is focused on creating a climate of success for all involved. Our focus on safety, service, and efficiency won't waver as we continue to provide the best service product we can for our customers. With that, over to you Kevin. Kevin Boone : All right, thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. The team continues to build momentum with our customers, targeting modal share conversion and quickly bringing solutions to the market that target profitable growth. Our ability to react quickly and provide solutions for our customers was highlighted by our efforts in Baltimore, where we rapidly stood up an alternative solution to meet the intermodal needs of the community. Despite a continuing weak truck market, the team has done a great job focusing on developing new opportunities, including truck to rail conversion, industrial development, working closer with our rail partners to identify joint opportunities and accelerating strategic discussions that allow our customers to benefit from our best-in-class service. Communication and collaboration between sales and marketing and operations is a key differentiator for CSX. Our recent voice of the customer survey results for the first quarter shows the highest service scores since we began the survey, which highlights the positive trajectory that we are on. Let's turn to Slide 7 to look at our merchandise performance. Our merchandise revenues were up 1% compared to last year with flat volumes and a 1% increase in RPU as contract renewals and slightly favorable mix more than offset the effect of lower fuel surcharge. Across the business lines, automotive accelerated nicely after a slow start at several manufacturing plants. Chemicals, our largest market continues to gain momentum in plastics, food, and NGLs. Forest product volumes were flat overall but saw encouraging signs in pull board and building products as the construction season appears to be off to a stronger start. We told you that minerals face a tough comparison for aggregates, which were unseasonably strong in the first quarter of 2023. But total demand is very strong against a healthy backlog of large construction projects with infrastructure spending expected to accelerate. Metals volumes were a bit weaker year-over-year with the weather affecting flows in certain scrap markets. Finished steel has also been a bit sluggish, but we see opportunity for sequential improvement in the back half of the year. Fertilizer volumes continue to be unimpacted by phosphate production issues here in Florida, but an early application season in certain markets supported demand for longer-haul, higher-yield shipments of potash and other fertilizers, which lifted our RPU. Finally, our ag and food business remains relatively soft, constrained by a strong global soybean supplies, which limit demand for US exports and still high availability of local crops in many of our customer regions. Underlying demand across grains, feed, and food products is solid and we're optimistic challenging conditions will normalize into the back half of the year. Turning to Slide 8. For the first quarter, coal revenue was flat year-over-year as 2% volume growth was offset by a 2% decline in all-in RPU, largely due to fuel surcharge. Our benchmark-based export yields were slightly lower compared to last year, but we also got some benefit from favorable mix on the domestic side. As expected, shipments reflected the strength in export markets with export tonnage up 25% year-over-year. It really is a testament to the great work by the team, including the credible work by operations to meet the increased demand. We also anticipated that the domestic market would be challenged by low natural gas prices and lapping last year's restocking demand. Domestic shipments for the quarter were down 17% against a very tough comparison in the first quarter of 2023. With Baltimore and the effects of the collapse of the Key Bridge, I'm going to stress how important our partnership is with the city. As Joe noted before, we have a long history with Baltimore, going back to the very beginning of our railroad. And the ONE CSX team is working hard to find alternative solutions to help the community and our customers. In terms of the revenue impact to CSX, export coal will see a near-term headwind with both our Curtis Bay facility and the dual-serve console marine terminal that are unable to load vessels. Two days following the incident, Joe and I joined senior leadership from CSX to visit key alternative export facilities. We have already begun to divert a portion of our Baltimore volumes to other outlets. Currently, we estimate that the net revenue impact to CSX from the port closure is between $25 million and $30 million per month, including the benefit of diverting some of these tons. It's still very early in the remediation process, but the Army Corps of Engineers has projected that the full channel depth, which we need for coal vessels to be reopened by the end of May. It's also likely that you see a good amount of congestion immediately after reopening, but there's potential for it to take a few weeks to ramp back up to full run rate. In the meantime, we are studying in communication with our customers, business partners, state, local, and federal authorities. We are working closely with Mike and his team to make sure we are optimizing all available resources to serve our customers as successfully as possible. Turning the intermodal on Slide 9. Revenue increased 1% on 7% volume growth. Lower fuel surcharge and negative mix pulled our RPU lower by 5%. Growth was very strong for our international business as healthy consumer demand and more normalized inventories have supported higher import levels. We saw volumes increase year-over-year with many of our shipping partners as we gained from new contracts, new lanes, and a comparison with last year's weak market conditions. We are very encouraged by the recovery we are seeing and continued positive demand signals as we look over the rest of the year. Our domestic intermodal business also grew over the quarter at a more moderate pace than what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. What's been constant is our service performance, which continues to help us win new business and drive truck conversion even as the weak truck market conditions persist. We're optimistic that truck capacity will normalize in time, even benefit the intermodal market. More importantly, we are confident that we will be prepared when the demand rebounds. Finally, let's turn to Slide 10, where we have an update on our industrial development program. Our project pipeline remains strong with hundreds of companies eager to partner with us to find attractive ways to expand their production capacity on rail surf sites. Something that's often overlooked is how diverse these development projects really are. The chart on left shows the market split. Based on potential carload volume or the approximately 100 facilities that have come online over the last 12 months, these new sites and expansions represent $4.2 billion in total capital investment and have added new capacity in many of our key markets such as chemicals, minerals and forest products. But this is only scratching the surface. The chart on the right shows the market split for the full development pipeline ranging from projects we anticipate starting up later this year to project proposals that will be constructed several years from now. There are two key takeaways from this forward-looking view. First, the total estimated potential carload opportunity measured by expected capacity implies a meaningful acceleration in activity as we look-forward. Scopes can change and timelines can shift, but the setup is very encouraging for meaningful growth contribution over multiple years. Second, the long-term pipeline is also diverse. We are excited about the multiple electric vehicle manufacturing facilities that are scheduled to come online over the next several years. When combined together with related raw material or battery facilities, they represent approximately 12% of the total long-term volume potential. Minerals, metals, chemicals and other projects represent larger contributors. This is a big opportunity for CSX and our industrial development team has been working non-stop to build the partnerships that make all of this possible. We're excited to tell you that there's much more to come. With that, let me turn it off -- let me hand it over to Sean. Thank you. Sean Pelkey : Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. First quarter revenue fell by 1%, while operating income was down 8% or $110 million. These results include a number of discrete items versus the prior year with approximately $140 million of impacts from last year's insurance recovery, changes in net fuel, as well as declines in other revenue and export coal pricing. Across merchandise coal and intermodal, revenue excluding fuel recovery increased 4% in the quarter, benefiting from 3% volume growth and strong pricing across the merchandise portfolio. Expenses were 4% higher and I will discuss the line items in more detail on the next slide. Underlying results reflect continued momentum generated by the ONE CSX team, both in our service-driven top-line performance and broad-based cost-control and efficiency initiatives. Q1 was our second consecutive quarter of sequential operating income growth despite a $30 million net fuel headwind relative to Q4. In addition, sequential operating margins grew nearly 100 basis points, demonstrating this team's focus on growth and efficient service performance. This momentum positions us well to deliver year-over-year gains in the back half of 2024. Interest and other expense was $9 million higher compared to the prior year, while income tax expense fell $25 million on lower pretax earnings net of a slightly higher effective rate. As a result, earnings per share decreased $0.02, including $0.05 of impact from the previously mentioned discrete items. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. Total first quarter expense increased by $85 million. Turning to the individual line items, labor and fringe increased $75 million, mostly impacted by inflation, higher headcount, costs from union employees' sick pay, and higher incentive compensation. Even so, cost per employee was down versus the fourth quarter, and we expect cost per employee to again be favorable sequentially in Q2. Total headcount should remain stable despite higher seasonal volumes. Purchase services and other expense increased $23 million, which includes a $46 million impact from a prior year insurance recovery. Efficiency gains evident on this line represent significant cross-functional collaboration to drive sustainable cost improvements across both operating and overhead budgets. We expect this momentum to continue going forward. Depreciation was up $17 million due to a larger asset base. Fuel cost was down $39 million, mostly driven by a lower gallon price. Progress continued in fuel efficiency, which improved year-over-year and saw smaller than normal seasonal degradation from Q4, despite severe winter weather earlier in the quarter. Finally, equipment and rents increased by $2 million, while property gains were unfavorable by $7 million. Now turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 14, free cash flow of $560 million is lower year-to-date, driven by a decrease in net earnings, increased investment in the business, and deferred tax payments, partially offset by prior year back wage payouts. CSX exits Q1 with a healthy balance sheet and an A-rated credit profile. Our first priority remains investing capital towards safety, reliability, and long-term growth. CSX also distributed nearly $500 million to shareholders, split between share repurchases and dividends, demonstrating our balanced but opportunistic approach to returning excess cash. We also believe a long-term focus on economic profit aligns our interest with that of our shareholders. While first-quarter economic profit declined due to previously mentioned discrete headwinds, we expect it to increase over time as we efficiently convert freight off the highway while maintaining strong asset utilization and attractive returns on our capital spending. Now with that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. Joe Hinrichs : All right. Thank you, Sean. Now, we will conclude our remarks by walking through our guidance for the full year 2024, which has not changed. Led by our customer service, we continue to expect total volume and total revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. We expect our merchandise business to gain momentum through the year as effects from new business wins, truck conversions, and the ramp-up of industrial development projects build on a favorable trends in many of our end markets. We look for steady growth in intermodal, supported by stable consumer demand and more normalized retail inventories, which are driving improved port activity. We continue to work closely with our channel partners, finding creative solutions to gain share even as the truck market remains soft. Global benchmark coal prices have fluctuated but remain high compared to history. And though the situation at the port of Baltimore limits some of the export volume in the near term, we are taking actions to effectively mitigate as much of the impact as we can. Our team at Curtis Bay and across the rest of the coal franchise will be ready to ramp back up as quickly as possible once the channel returns to full operation. On profitability, we made good progress this quarter and grew our operation margins -- operating margin sequentially. And as you saw in our results and heard from the team on this call, we benefited from volume growth, solid pricing gains, and focused efforts to improve efficiency and productivity. Our goal is to consistently grow our margins over time. And while Baltimore and global coal prices are near-term challenges, we feel very good about our ability to deliver strong incremental performance in the second half of this year. There is no change to our CapEx forecast of $2.5 billion. And as you heard from Sean, our balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns remains in place. To conclude, during the quarter, where there were many potential distractions, I am very proud of how the ONE CSX team stuck to our plan, focused on execution, prioritized our customers, and achieved good results. There is much more to come as we make every effort to run safer, faster, and more reliably for our customers so we can deliver profitable growth over the long term. Thanks to all of your interest in the company and, Matthew, we're ready to take questions. Matthew Korn : Thank you, Joe. We will now move to our question-and-answer session. In the interest of time and to make sure that everyone on this call has an opportunity to take part, we ask you to please limit yourselves to one and only one question. Brianna, we're ready to start the process. Operator : Thank you, Matthew. Your first question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead. Justin Long : Thanks. And to start, our thoughts and prayers are going out to Jim's family. Obviously, he left a great legacy on the industry. But for my question, I wanted to ask about the second quarter. Typically, you see a seasonal improvement sequentially in both margins and earnings. Do you still think that's possible despite the impact from the Baltimore port closure? And then I guess along those lines, curious if you have any thoughts around coal RPU in the second quarter as well? Thanks. Sean Pelkey : Hey, Justin, happy to take both of those questions. So yeah, in terms of sequential improvement, that's normally what we see from Q1 to Q2. While clearly, the Baltimore impact is going to be felt in the second quarter, we still feel that we should be able to grow earnings sequentially from Q1 to Q2. And what I would say is, that's both top-line as well as being able to do it while containing costs and deliver really strong incremental margins from Q1 to Q2. The headwind clearly is export coal, not just the Baltimore impact, but in terms of RPU, I think pricing has come down. What we're seeing right now in the marketplace is probably something that's going to lead to a mid-to-high single-digit decline in coal RPU from Q1 to Q2. But even with that backdrop, still feel pretty good about our ability to continue this momentum. Operator : Your next question comes from John Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Chappell : Thank you, and good afternoon. Mike, as you indicated in your slides, you'd probably talk about velocity and dwell a little bit in this call. So obviously, there's been some disruption, whether it was weather in January or Port of Baltimore in the last part of March, but things have kind of filtered into a little bit into April as well. Can you just give us a state of the union on why some of those metrics have maybe moved in the opposite direction as when you first started and kind of how you get them back moving in the right direction as soon as in the next couple of weeks? Mike Cory : Yeah, sure, John. Thank you very much for the questions. But I just want to make it really loud and clear. These metrics are extremely important. We're not happy with them. They're not significant, and I'll put it in perspective here. So some of the -- we really shocked the system. And one of the first things we did was really start to look at the efficiency of our capital -- engineering capital programs for $1.5 billion envelope. And quite frankly, last year we didn't get the work done and we paid more than we should have for the work that we got done. So this year we decided that we were going to be very strict about the curfews. And those are anytime the track is out and either for between six and 10 hours across our network for these big giant gangs to get out there and do all their work with rail ties, bridges, you name it. And again, we started this probably around -- you can see the dip probably around early February, late January, because it was after the winter started. But after we went through the winter storms and it really impacted our southern corridors. We stuck to our guns. We held our trains at the terminals to run in line with the curfew that dwells the cars in the yard that also congests and bunches up traffic. And so we really let that go for a month. But then we've been working ever since that point to start to redefine the program that we're doing, split up the work. And one thing we really did before was do all the work in the south during the winter time, because of the winter up north. We've got to find ways and we will to spread the work out. But that in itself caused a fluctuation in train speed from previous years because we did not be that strict. We've come in under our rail and tie budget. So everything unit cost wise is the right way. But the biggest thing it provides that safety -- that safety hardening of the track that we need to do every year with the volume we move. That's number one. If you remember, we went into last quarter, we reduced 5% of our crew starts and we absorbed [1.5%] (ph) GTMs, 3% carloads, whatever you want to call it, without any more change in headcount. What that did was really focuses on increasing the tonnage on the train. That then starts to convert itself to better utilization of locomotives. Something as simple as going from three to two. Those things start to slow the trains. But they're still within an acceptable parameter. And as far as I am concerned right now, it's not where we want to be, though. On top of that, we really took a strict view on our use of trip optimizer. And that's really there to moderate the speed of the train, but again, get its fuel efficiency. We increased our use by over 10% this quarter. So we did all this over the backdrop of a typical first quarter. If you look last year, the numbers came down as well. And then you get whether you want to call it winter. They're excuses, but these things on top of that, I'm comfortable with all the actions we're taking that we will figure out a better way to do the work blocks. But at the same time, this is forcing the folks in our terminals that you don't have as many outlets at times to move their cars. And so we're working through that. In fact, it got to the point now where in going through this exercise, we started to identify some yards that were closed for the right reason, I shouldn't say closed, but they were disconfigured. I'm not talking about opening up pumps, but there's some strategic yards that we're going to look at using as we go forward that I'm looking at quite a few out of road car miles, handlings, all the good stuff that produces more speed, but at a reduced cost. And we don't find that until you start to push the program. We could have easily just absorbed traffic, put some more trains on. PSR is not running the speed. PSR is providing the proper service at the right cost and being able to incrementally grow your margins and grow your business. And so that's really what's going on. I see improvement in the future. I see it every day. I see the engagement of our folks. This has also provided a real opportunity for us to teach our operating supervisors how to balance. As Sean said earlier, there's a lot of cost in everywhere we look on this railway. Obviously, the biggest is labor and fuel, and that's what we're tackling. But this is teaching them how to go about this exercise without at the end sacrificing customer service. And one dwell number we don't show is our arrival to placement for our customers. It's improved 10% in many of the major industrial areas. The reason for that is we have actually increased our local service. We've taken some of the money we saved on the liner although we make sure we're trying to build trust with our customers, because now the next opportunity -- one of the next opportunities to look at their fleets and get them to work with us, to trust us, to be there like we are and hopefully reduce some of the fleet that we have out there and still add more incremental business onto what we have. I hope that answers it, but there's a plan behind this. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah, good afternoon. I wanted to get some thoughts. I think just pricing and I know you got a bunch of moving parts. I'm thinking ex the coal item. But we've seen, I guess from J. B. Hunt and Knight and some of these surface transport-focused companies that there's weak demand and there's even more pressure on pricing. And so I just wanted to try to get a sense of if in your merchandise, you're getting good price, is there some headwind that affects what you do on price and revenue per car from this ongoing weakness. So just, I guess, trying to think about is price stable, is it going to get better and the way we model price, which ends up being revenue per car? Thank you. Kevin Boone : Yeah, Tom. Nothing has changed on the pricing side. We're obviously a tough truck backdrop. That will improve and we'll see a lot of benefits from that I think, as we see the cycle hopefully has bottomed here from what we're seeing. But I -- when you look at-the market, what we do on the pricing side is obviously, we're able to capture that inflation and I don't see anything really changing there. It's always a balance and we manage the portfolio accordingly. And where there's opportunities, obviously to gain more-and-more volume, we work with our customers, but it's a core to what we -- how our growth algorithm works. It's volume and price as we look at it and nothing has changed there. As hopefully cost inflation comes down, then the customers will benefit from that going-forward. But obviously, not the environment that we had last year where inflation was very-high, that's starting to moderate some. Hopefully, the Fed gets a big-picture too and with the rates and things like that, but that's where we are today. Still as planned, I think I was very happy with what the results in the first-quarter, what the team was able to deliver, and we're right on-track. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Brian Ossenbeck : Hi, afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess, Sean, I wanted to come back to your comments on headcount. I think you said that it's still relatively flat going into the second quarter, that was the plan. I don't know if that holds for the rest of the year, but it sounded like at least in the near-term, so maybe you can elaborate on that a little bit. And also the comp per employee stepped down sequentially and you expect it to step-down again into 2Q. Can you just explain that trend? And of course, we should probably be thinking that that moves up in 3Q sequentially as you hit the new labor agreement with the 4.5% adjustment. So some additional thoughts on that and how that progresses and headcount overall will be helpful. Thank you. Sean Pelkey : Sure, Brian. Yeah. So on the headcount side, I would say we came into the year, we actually added a little bit from Q4 to Q1. Most of that was for the engineering work that Mike talked about and making sure that we could get everything done this year. We're going to manage that down through attrition. As we get to the second half of the year, we're going to watch business levels. We're going to see how we're running. But I think it's fair to assume that we're going to be relatively stable as we get to the second half, if not down a little bit sequentially. And so you're going to see a clear return to headcount labor productivity in the second half of the year. And then in terms of comp per employee, yep, second quarter will be another step down versus Q1. A couple of reasons for that. One is, first quarter, we had some winter-related costs. And then secondly, as some of the capital-related programs get a little more ramped up in the second quarter that has a benefit to cost per employee sequentially Q2 versus Q1. And then you're right, as we get to the second half of the year, the current labor agreement stipulates a 4.5% union wage increase. So we'll feel the impact of that as we go from second quarter into the second half. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Afternoon. So, Mike, it sounds like you're trying to find a balance right now between some of the service metrics and just OpEx. When you look cost, excluding fuel, was down just slightly from Q4 to Q1, how should we think about just overall cost ex fuel from Q1 into Q2? And then just -- maybe just overall, like we're a quarter into the year, it sounds like margins down year-over-year again in Q2, but inflecting positive in Q3, Q4. So full year, do we think we could see some margin improvement? Or is that -- given the first half, is that too much to ask? Mike Cory : Thank you, Scott. I'm going to let the expert over here, Sean, talk about margin because as you know, I never talk about margin. But your theories are right, like, we're trying to balance without first of all, safety and the customer without damaging that and we have a long way to go on safety. So these things -- that these things we're looking at are all focused on really on the cost side. So whether if we can shift some of the capital that we're planning to use by being more productive into other areas that we hadn't planned and make some of these yards useful or more useful than they are, I see definite cost benefit. It's things like that. It's not something -- Sean is looking at me, he's going to start talking a bit about the numbers. But really, that is our focus to bring that margin up on the cost side. But I'll turn it over to Scott -- to Sean. Sean Pelkey : Thanks, Mike. Yeah. And what he says is true. We're focused on how do we deliver growth and how do we do it at strong incremental margins by maintaining the fixed cost profile and not adding a whole lot of variable costs along the way. If not finding opportunities where we can run things more efficiently. So to your direct question about cost ex fuel, I think, yeah, it's fair to assume we got a chance to improve that even further going from Q1 to Q2. And that ties in with the comments I just made about comp per employee and keeping headcount relatively flat. So we'll build some momentum. I think the year-over-year comps are a little more difficult in Q2 given the Baltimore impacts. If that hadn't happened, maybe could have even grown operating income and margin in the second quarter. But with it, it makes it more challenging. Second half of the year, we feel good about the setup. Some of these headwinds that we're facing, the first couple of quarters paid. And we're going to have labor productivity. We'll continue to grow the business. The industrial development projects Kevin talked about, a number of those start to come on as we get a little bit later into the year. So there's a lot to like about it. We are not going to give any specific guidance about full year operating income growth, margin growth. But clearly, sticking with the low to mid-single-digit total volume and revenue growth is very helpful, particularly when we're focused on what we can do to drive continued efficiency gains. Joe Hinrichs : This is Joe. Just to add one more comment. So we'll work hard to try and help tell our story a little bit better and differently going forward. But I just want to be clear, our focus on the customer and customer service have not waned at all. And as you heard Kevin mention in his comments, we get surveys from our customers on a regular basis, and we have the best score that we've ever had in the first quarter. So we have to find a way to tell the story that isn't just told by velocity and dwell or even trip plan compliance. That's why we introduced the customer switch data and some other things. For example, our tonnage went up for train. And so if we combine a train, two trains to one, maybe we go from three engines to two engines, on being used in that combination and that higher tonnage train might be a little slower and might tell a little more dwell time, but the customer is okay with it. It helps our efficiency and the customer is still happy. And so -- but that will show up as little more dwell and a little less velocity but better efficiency. And as long as the customer is happy, we're okay. So we check with the customer first and then we work backwards, as opposed to some of the stories you've heard in the past, which was about our internal focus and then tell the customer about it later. That's a very unique and important difference and distinction. But importantly, as you saw quarter-over-quarter, while some of our numbers may look like they degraded, but our efficiency got better and our customer responses and survey responses were the best we ever had. So we're walking that fine line. So we're going to have to find a way to help you guys see that, and at the same time, getting more efficient. And working with our employees as ONE CSX team to teach them how to do that and work together to do that in a positive way. And that's the balance we're trying to do, and I appreciate Mike and his entire operations team working with Kevin and the sales and marketing team to bring that to life, and it's a collaborative effort. And it's worked because it's teaching. It's also listening, is finding creative solutions and not being focused on one metric. And at the end of the day, we can deliver sequential improvements. And so as long as we deliver sequential improvement to our customers and in our earnings, we can show you how that it leads to growth over time. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Kevin, I wonder if we can come back to the industrial development pipeline that you guys have been mentioning, the new graphic in the slide is somewhat helpful. But can you talk about the 100 facilities that have already opened and some examples where that's delivering volume today? And then how you expect that works through the end of '24 and into the beginning of next year? Kevin Boone : Yeah. I mean, look, we're in the very early stages of this. And when the facility comes online, there's usually -- depending on the industry, a 12- to 24-month ramp, right? And so for this year, for example, we have in the aggregate side, really on the metal side as well as where we've seen some concentration in that activity as we look forward. You can see where the activity is going to take place. But these projects, some of them longer than others. But once they come online, there's really a guide path of growth, as related to that as we bring that capacity on and enter the market. So -- we're excited about it. I think we'll share a lot more as the year progresses on and give you a lot more detail on how that layers in over time. But we thought we'd give a little more color just around how diverse that pipeline is and how it continues to build. And I think that's exciting to have diversity around. We're not concentrated in one single industry. It's really -- we're seeing it across the board in the markets that we serve. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ken Hoexter : Great. Thanks. And I'll throw in my condolences also to the Foote family, always had fun discussions with Jim over the last 20 years and appreciated his insights. So thanks for the comments earlier. Mike, just following up on another step here. Looking at flat headcount, low to mid-single-digit volumes and revenues. So when should we expect to see the service stats improve? When do we get the flow through? Have you seen that already in the data in April? And then I guess thinking about Baltimore and the impact of coal volumes now down 12.5% last week. So Baltimore is now impacting the results. How should we think about what percent of volumes can be moved to Newport and maybe improve some of the metrics? Thanks. Mike Cory : Yeah, Ken. That's a good question. I almost -- I thought I explained earlier. I'm not -- I can't give you an answer so much on when do we expect to see the service improve because the service is good. Like, we -- I expect to see over the next few quarters here, yeah, the velocity and dwell will continue to improve versus what they are. But the service level is going to be what the customer needs. And right now, that's what we're fulfilling. But -- so again, we're going to do a lot of different things here to test our facilities, our people that put -- we're trying to put stricter process in place. And that's going to have some effect until we learn to get through it. But I see the metrics improving. I see them now improving. It's just we still have -- we still have the odd thing that's taking place and lots of it's revolved around these engineering gangs that we are full hearted, like our full engineering team plus our operating, our transportation team are meeting as we speak, to continue to find a way to not have such restricted curfews, but we have to do. Other than that, the network is fluid. And I'll let Kevin talk about Baltimore and what we are doing with the shifting to Newport. Kevin Boone : Yeah. I think just looking at last week, not that we live week to week, this is going to be a little bit choppy with some of the terminals we're working with in terms of taking on some additional capacity. I don't think last week necessarily the trend that we're seeing, we're seeing some good performance and then stepping up here this week on that. But when you look at the impact, I explained $25 million to $30 million net impact from the Baltimore incident, that will continue at least through May, and then we'll probably have a hopefully glide path end of June of improving that. But we're looking at offsetting a third of that business, maybe a little bit more if we can get all of the terminals to work with us. Operator : Your next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. Hi, thanks. Just curious, can you talk a little bit maybe specifically what the international intermodal growth was in the quarter versus domestic? And based on your comments, it seems like International is outstripping domestic, maybe by a wide margin. I'm not sure. Why is that the case? And what gets domestic Intermodal growth rate back up? You trip plan compliance looks really good. So I'm just sort of curious those dynamic plans. Kevin Boone : Look, I think, obviously, the comps on the International side were fairly easy in the first quarter. That's where we saw some pretty dramatic declines last year, as you saw destocking happening almost across the board in a lot of companies out there. So we benefited from that. The team has done an amazing job of identifying new services, some other areas, that identified some profitable growth that we went after, good contract relationships. We're aligned with the right partners, and we benefited from that. So you've seen double-digit growth on our international side, while our domestic was slightly up this past quarter and the domestic market is a lot more truck competitive, as we all know. And if you've been listening the last couple of days, it hasn't been -- the trucking companies have obviously struggled, and I think we're pretty proud of the results we were able to put up in that context. We think there's better days ahead, but certainly a challenging market and the results were good in that context for sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Bascome Majors : Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a bit about how some of the emerging uncertainty at your Eastern competitor has helped you perhaps capture some volume short term? And maybe longer term, has that uncertainty at another rail impacted the desire or intention of some of your customers to really start to use rail more as an outlet in their supply chains that you've been working for years now with industrial development and other efforts? Thank you. Joe Hinrichs : Thanks, Bascome. This is Joe. As you know, certainly in the time frame that I've been here with this ONE CSX team, we've been really focused on our mission, which is really to focus on improving the employee culture and the employee experience through ONE CSX and to get better service to our customers, which we believe will lead to profitable growth for ourselves and importantly, growth with our customers. That hasn't changed and hasn't waned. I think in fact, what you've seen over the last couple of months is customers coming out and wanting that commitment to service and that commitment to -- for our whole industry to be focused on what can we do to grow. So we're not distracted by what's going on and certainly not getting distracted by it. We're focused on what we can do, and as you saw in the quarter sequential improvement across the Board, and we talked about our confidence in to be able to continue to deliver that. And that's what I'm really proud of our team, is not getting distracted and staying focused on our customers, on our employees. We need to improve safety, as Mike talked about and looking for opportunities to grow. And what we're hearing from customers, they're very happy with the service CSX is providing, and they're very pleased with the continuity and the consistency of our messaging, but also our results, interactions. And that's what we want to stay focused on. At the higher level, as you hinted at, as an industry, we have to continue to get better service to our customers. I talked about it extensively at many different conferences and events, and we're all working together to do that. I'm seeing more collaboration across the industry to make that happen, and I'm encouraged by that, and we want to be a part of that. And so to ultimately realize the potential of this entire industry, we all need to get better, at the fluidity of our network, how we work together and the service we provide to our customers. And that's going to take us working better with all the stakeholders in this industry to help make that happen. So we can grow as industry if and when we all get better at customer service and working together. So that's the focus we have at CSX. You're not going to see us change our -- there's no 2.0 or 3.0, 4.0 plan. It's the same ONE CSX, focusing on our employees and our customers, and you're going to see us continue to execute. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Seidl : Thank you operator. Sort of along those lines, we've seen a huge shift on the intermodal side back to the over-the-road operators mainly due to price. And then I guess, last year, some operational issues at the Class I rails and some declining diesel prices. I guess two things. What percent do you think the gap has to close between where trucking pricing is now for domestic intermodal to start getting business back? And have you been able to quantify just how much freight shifted to the over-the-road market? Thanks. Kevin Boone : Yeah. Thanks, Jason. Look, there's still a value proposition out there. Was it a little bit tighter than maybe a year ago when truck prices were a lot healthier? Absolutely. And I think the discussion is more about when you look at it, what can add value in the near term. I mean when you have to do nothing and you get price declines in your trucking business, then you're not as compelled to look at the intermodal option as you would be in a more normalized market. And so I think that all probably balances out as we get it through the year. It feels like we're at the bottom, bouncing along here. And as things solidify, I think those conversations accelerate. We've put up domestic growth, and we're pretty proud of that. The product that we're offering, the service that we're offering is compelling in the market even at these lows, and I can only imagine how compelling it\u2019s going to be as the market recovers. So we're pretty excited about it. We're talking about it actively as a group of when the growth comes back, that we're going to be prepared more than anybody else to handle it. So that's exciting for us. When that recovery happens, we're not certain, I think it's fair to say the trucking market is probably a little bit worse than what people anticipated coming into the year, but we were pretty resilient in a very, very challenging market. Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Ben Nolan : Yeah, thanks. I was going to ask a little bit about the Baltimore impact, I appreciate the $25 million to $30 million a month. Just curious if that is predominantly coal or if there are any other impacts on maybe some of the other business lines? And then also in addition to the revenue impact, are there any cost impacts from rerouting to other ports or anything below the revenue line that we should think about? Kevin Boone : I'll cover the revenue one. That one's easy. It's coal that we're seeing there, maybe some slight opportunities, but they're not large enough to be impactful to that number. On the cost side, Mike. Mike Cory : Yeah. And I think Kevin alluded to it, we had a little bit of a rough start-up going over to Newport and that's now smoothed itself out. But really not a lot more cost then. The -- most of the traffic moves through, other than the [point of coal] (ph). So not significant in that sense, no. Kevin Boone : I just want to tell you guys a little story because I get often asked all the time, what are the benefits of ONE CSX and the culture we're trying to achieve here. Within two days of the incident in Baltimore, we put out a request for transfers from our engineers and conductors, who were in our locations to be able to relocate temporarily for a couple of months to help with the change in the train setup and schedule we needed to support the movement of coal elsewhere. And we needed maybe a dozen people to go, and we had seven, eight times that people immediately sign up to help. And that's a testament to what we're seeing here is that our people are willing to be a part of the solution and to serve our customers and know how important that is. And that's just a great example. So there's a little bit of cost of that relocation and a temporary transfer. But I can tell you, a little over a year ago, we were trying to get temporary transfers, and we struggled. And this time, we have so many people signed up, it was great to see. And those are the signs you want to see of a healthy culture and people are really service oriented, but also understand the bigger picture of what we're trying to do here in serving our customers. And so we have not been the constraint or the bottleneck at all. In fact, we've been able to really -- Kevin and I were with one of our largest coal customers the other day and he was just so proud of the work we've done and our team has done to respond so quickly and be able to react, and that's a testament to our people. That's just another example of why it's so important to stay consistently focused on our culture and our people and help them understand that we're here to serve customers, and that's why we exist to do it safely, obviously, and efficiently, but that message is resonating and our people are responding. Mike Cory : And just one more point, Ben, I should mention this is. With this issue, we've been able to get a betterment in terms of our maintenance at Curtis Bay. We've been able to go in there and do work that we would have had to do it under load with a lot of volume moving through. So we've fully taken advantage of some pretty major restoration that we were able to accomplish that we're still working on. So that's been a good thing. Operator : Your next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Amit Mehrotra : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Sean, I just wanted to clarify one quick thing. I think in response to the first question, regarding 1Q to 2Q, you said profits up. I don't know if you said margins up. You may have said it, but I didn't catch it. Just want to clarify by that point. And then, Kevin, I just wanted to talk about interchange. So I think before -- unless I\u2019m mistaken, maybe you interchange half your volumes. Any -- is that mostly evenly split between the two West Coast rails or I'm just trying to understand how much do you actually interchange with UP? And what proportion of kind of that interchange -- total interchange is actually represented by the EP? Thank you. Sean Pelkey : Amit, it's Sean. I'll take the first part. Yeah, profit up Q2 versus Q1 and margins up. I think that's a fair expectation on both sides. Kevin Boone : Look, I think we said roughly half of our business touches another railroad. And certainly, when you look at the Western railroads, particularly UP, they are a very large part of that. So they're a very important partner to us. All of our partners are very important. So it's encouraging to hearing a lot of signs to go after more business, and we're working collaboratively to do that. So a lot of opportunities out there that we see. Operator : Your next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Walter Spracklin : Yeah. Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Sean, when I'm comparing your outlook, and I know your outlook is unchanged from prior. When I look at your -- what -- some of your commentary regarding the moving parts that have occurred in the first quarter and looking into the rest of the year, you did have a little bit of a tougher January. Mike pointed to some operating measures that aren't where we want them to be. You've got a worse coal market, there was a Baltimore outage. Trucking is worse but you maintain your guidance. So I'm just curious as to what -- if those are the puts, what are the takes in terms of what's the offset here to maintain your guidance despite kind of those headwinds that emerged a little bit here so far in 2024? Sean Pelkey : Yeah, Walter, I'll do my best on that one. So yeah, I mean, certainly, a little bit of winter in January, couple of things there. And then, of course, the Baltimore outage was unexpected, and that's a hit to the forecast. But still feel very confident about what the second half looks like, in particular, from a volume and revenue perspective and what it looks like on the cost side. We did an exercise here where we looked at every dollar of every budget and there's a lot of small wins that we're getting here, just $1 million, $2 million here and there across every line item, both within operations and across the business. So I think it's everybody focused on how do we deliver the kind of economic financial performance that sort of backs up all the momentum that we've got with ONE CSX, the goodwill that we've got with the customer. And to the extent there's revenue headwinds, how do we close the gap on some of those, but still a lot of confidence, I think, from the CSX team. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephanie Moore : Hi, good afternoon, thank you. I wanted to maybe switch gears a little bit and talk about maybe capital allocation and maybe your focus on share repurchases, have seen it kind of come down a little bit over the last couple of quarters. So I just wanted to gauge your appetite in terms of incremental share repurchases as the year progresses. Thanks. Sean Pelkey : Thanks, Stephanie. It\u2019s Sean. We're still committed to the share repurchase as well as the dividend. It's certainly a step down in the first quarter of the year, but we -- the stock ran up pretty quickly. And so we try to be opportunistic and gauge the amount of buybacks that we do based on the momentum in the stock. So with the pullback that we've had recently, we're buying a little bit more. Still committed to do a significant amount of share repurchases this year. It will be a little bit less than it was last year, just simply because we came into the year with a little bit less cash on the balance sheet. And last year, we raised a little bit of incremental debt to help juice the system, and that led to some additional buybacks, but we're still very committed to that, and you'll see it go up and down quarter-to-quarter just based on the opportunity that we have in the market. Operator : Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So, a two-parter here on the ports. One just on Baltimore, a follow-up. I think you've said you redirected about 33% of the traffic so far. Does that mean there's going to be like pent-up demand when the channel is kind of normalized in 3Q or late 2Q and beyond? Just wanted to confirm that. And also on the East Coast to West Coast kind of share shift, kind of what innings are we kind of on the normalization there? And are you hearing from your customers ahead of labor talks on the East Coast ports and maybe any preparations there? Thank you. Kevin Boone : Yeah. Look, in terms of pent-up demand, there's outages in the summer that happened for the coal miners and we'll see how they handle that with some of the obviously, slowdown that we've seen. Is there opportunity to make up to this volume in the third and fourth quarter? There is. That's not in the plan right now, but we'll see how that plays out. The prices remain strong. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of incentive to meet those contractual obligations and those things. On the East Coast, West Coast, look, if you've been to Savannah lately, there's huge, huge investments going on in investments. Obviously, when you're spending billions of dollars, you've got to have visibility to the demand out there and -- there's tremendous demand that they see coming. And we're not hearing any anticipation of significant trade moving from the east to west. Obviously, if that happened and they want to move to the East, there could be a net benefit to us. So I think from our perspective, it's probably a neutral outcome if that happened. And in some cases, you could see some business that normally would come into the ports and move truck that would come over the less than move over our railroad, which would be an incremental opportunity for us. So I don't see a high probability to risk there, maybe some more opportunities if that happens, but we'll continue to watch it. But over the long term, we see a lot of capacity growth in the East, and it\u2019s just not there in the West. Operator : Your next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. JD Millan : Thank you for taking the question. This is JD Millan for David Vernon. I guess, Kevin, going back to the question on the 10x opportunity, can you give us some more color on what is driving this massive tenfold increase? Is it just traffic coming on from the highway in [indiscernible], or is it more of an increase on the efforts from your team? Just a little bit of color on that would be helpful. Thank you. Kevin Boone : I think generally, there's a lot of geopolitical risk out there. There's a lot of movement in terms of how companies post the pandemic are thinking about their supply chains. And we talked about this before, but a supply -- their supply chains are being viewed as competitive advantages and being closer to your end consumer, which we have the most valuable consumers in our network in the world, it's becoming a priority, and we're seeing those investments take place to really happen. So it's broad based, as I mentioned, a lot of activity, but I think that's the major draw. I think they saw through the pandemic, a lot of disruption with how much it costs to get things delivered to the end consumers. So now it provides an opportunity where we can maybe get the inbound and the outbound, which is pretty exciting for us. So it will happen over time. There's already a lot of capital on the ground, a lot of the capital that's already been spent. So we'll participate in that. But it's a really shift from what we've seen probably over the last three or four decades, in terms of activity. And rather than the industrial base decaying within our network, we see some growth in that industrial base, which should benefit us over time. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much. And our thoughts are with the Foote family as well, just a terrific guy. I want to go back to Bascome's question on any nervousness with customers using other rails, given all the media and the hype, maybe not so much in terms of customer wins, but at this point, what types of questions or what types of concerns are being raised to you? And is there an anxiety among the customer base? Kevin Boone : Look, I mean, I've seen more activity with our customers willing us to share us their truck files to really open up the book in terms of what their supply chain looks like, given some of the service performance we've been able to achieve over the last few quarters. So that's exciting for us. We're really looking internally about what we can deliver. I think customers want certainty and they want visibility. And I think we're providing that. They understand the path we're on. They're supportive of that path, and they're seeing the service along with it. So we had many customers last year, say, hey, we want to see the service and then we can talk about more opportunities for you. And now we're in the midst of a lot of those discussions, and it's -- the team is working really hard. The backdrop, the wind is not at our back. Clearly, we have a lot of markets that are at cyclical lows. Those will come back. But the opportunity right now is to win wallet share. And as you win wallet share and the markets turn, that would translate into a lot of growth for us. So incredibly excited. We're internally focused on what we can accomplish those discussions, what we can deliver. And I think we're having a lot of those conversations. Joe Hinrichs : And Joe, Kevin and I have -- sorry, Kevin and I have spent, I don't know how many customers we've met with in the last couple of months, but we've had an FDA and a number of other events. I think we've touched almost every major customer we have and directly personally. And we've seen a lot of -- gotten a lot of feedback on the consistency, reliability and the continuity of our messaging and also our actions. And that's what customers want, having been on for decades myself just want to have reliability and they want constancy of purpose. They want to know what you stand for is you're going to deliver it. And that's what we're starting to show, and as Kevin said, our customer is starting to trust us again, which is the foundation for us to be able to grow with them as from the trust us, and that's the trust we want to keep delivering and building and gaining because of the constancy of what we're standing for, which is, of course, -- we're going to engage our employees with ONE CSX to serve our customers better and do that with better safety. The efficiency will come from the actions that we teach and what we do. And so we're going to stay on that course and it's delivering for us, and you saw it in the first quarter, and you'll see it again next quarter. Operator : This will conclude our question-and-answer session. And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2024 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. You may begin. Matthew Korn : Thank you, JL. Hello, everyone, and good afternoon. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In the presentation accompanying this call, you will find slides with our forward-looking disclosures and our non-GAAP disclosures for your review. Also, please note that our 10-Q has been filed and is available on our website. With that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs. Joseph R. Hinrichs: Alright. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter call today. Before we start, I want to acknowledge and appreciate all our CSX employees who are out there working throughout the Southeast United States as we deal with the weather effects from Hurricane Debby. We are prioritizing the safety of our employees and our communities in everything we do. Now, this was a strong quarter for CSX. I am pleased that our results reflect the momentum that we are building as a one CSX team. And I\u2019m proud to see how teams all across our railroad are working together in better and more effective ways than ever before. Operationally, we are developing initiatives to take an excellent scheduled railroading model and make it safer, leaner and more cost effective while providing the consistency and flexibility that our growing customer base demands. And commercially, our sales and marketing organization is creating new, more targeted methods for us to go to market, create partnerships and use our leading value proposition to convert customers onto CSX rail. Now, there is much we have accomplished so far this year and we are eager to maintain and build on our momentum over the rest of the year. We keep reminding the entire ONE CSX team that when we are aligned with each other and work together as one team, there\u2019s really nothing we cannot achieve. Our employees, our customers, and our shareholders are seeing how we are growing the business, controlling costs, leading in customer service, and leveraging our network capacity in ways we never could before. A successful culture we are building at CSX is delivering positive business outcomes. Now, we can go over some of the highlights. Let\u2019s go to Slide 1. On Slide 1, we show that some of the key results from our second quarter compared to revised results from past periods. Later on this call, Sean will provide more detail on the review of the accounting treatment for engineering scrap and certain engineering support labor as described in our financial report. Total volume grew by 2% with our intermodal franchise again leading the unit growth of 5% versus last year. And, we are proud to achieve this result even with the constraints at the Port of Baltimore that impacted our coal shipments. Our coal team did an excellent job finding creative ways to respond to the key bridge collapse and deliver for our customers. Our operating margin reached 39.1% which represents a 280 basis point sequential improvement. Revenue adjusted over $3.7 billion was flat compared to the second quarter of 2023 and up modestly over last quarter as strong merchandise pricing and volume growth offset lower coal prices and decline in other revenue. Operating income was 1% lower than last year but up by 8% sequentially as our efficiency efforts helped reduce expense. Our earnings per share were flat versus last year and up by 9% sequentially. Overall, this was a good quarter that was right in-line with our expectations. Had we not faced the incident in Baltimore, our operating income would have been higher year-over-year. Our challenge now is to keep moving forward by focusing on our execution even as markets fluctuate and unexpected events occur as they always do. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike Cory to discuss our operational performance. Mike Cory : Thank you, Joe, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Here\u2019s a rundown of our operating activities in the quarter. But before I do that, I\u2019d just like to extend my sincere thanks to the ONE CSX operations team for their effort and their contribution day-in and day-out. We all here truly appreciate everyone\u2019s teamwork and efforts. So, let\u2019s go to Slide 3, the first slide on safety. We saw positive trends on train accidents for the quarter year-over-year. The reduction was driven mainly by fewer mechanical related derailments and a reduction in human failure accidents, although human failure remains our highest causation factor. On injuries, we saw both an increase in transportation and engineering employee incidents. Slips, trips, and falls remain the highest related cause for injury. This is an area where increased attention to risk has tremendous potential to reduce personal injury. Much of our focus is on the development of heightened risk awareness for our less experienced employees who have the highest rate of accident and injury occurrence. By working with our union colleagues, we\u2019re becoming better able to help our employees learn how to identify at risk situations and hazards. Though we have a long way to go, through this collaboration, we believe improvements and safety will take place. We\u2019ve also embarked on an all-inclusive safe operations cultural transformation. This transformation starts with my leadership team and I will extend throughout to every leader at CSX. This three-year initiative is the most extensive safety leadership program we have ever embarked on. We\u2019ll support a culture of risk awareness and care where everyone knows they are valued, appreciated, respected, and included. ONE CSX was the first phase of this effort to align the organization to our values and cultural principles. This next initiative will be an extension of ONE CSX. We\u2019ll have a strong focus on strengthening our safety leadership skills while building engagement with our employees. We\u2019ll be aggressively identifying and eliminating unacceptable risks in our operations, which benefits all our stakeholders. So, going over to the next slide, overall, our fluidity metrics have remained pretty consistent. Our train speed has improved, but we have seen some variability in dwell. Effectively, our dwell metric reflects a combination of our team focusing on keeping cost tightly in-line while maintaining the level of service our customers require. As we\u2019ve deeply dug into train size and local service, we found some cases where we were spending money to switch a customer when the service was not necessarily required. This was reducing the dwell metric, but wasn\u2019t positively impacting the customer experience, and it wasted precious train and engine resources as well as overall costs. We\u2019re eliminating these unproductive handlings even though in some cases it will result in higher overall dwell. On the flip side, we\u2019re spending a considerable amount of time evaluating our network infrastructure to identify opportunities that will increase the efficiency of certain yards and reduce the dwell going forward. These evaluation exercises start by analyzing the present level of production against demand, ensuring proper standards are in place and that those standards are being met. Then we aim to increase workload and reduce both handling at other locations and a reduction of route miles when possible. This can entail simple self-funded improvements in the infrastructure at some of our switching yards to eliminate car handlings and route miles. Effectively, we\u2019re creating more mass where it makes sense, resulting in improved asset speed, service, and reliability. As we identify physical improvements to the infrastructure, we work with our supervisors to lead that process, so they understand how to extract the intended value and more. This experience teaches them to continue to strive for both productive work and opportunities for service or growth potential. This initial exercise has been also been supported by a reduction in cost through better utilization of our major engineering gangs as well. Through all these exercises, supervisors are the largest area of a focus for us as we continue to develop the bench strength on CSX and position them to understand their overall operations better. And, we\u2019re supporting them through a variety of methods, which include increasing visibility of leading indicators. We\u2019re teaching them then how to utilize that data to identify areas improvement and the overall cost of their operations, and they get a lot of daily engagement with the senior leadership team. A great greater focus is to ensure they gain a far deeper understanding of the overall operational and customer activities within their charge. We expect to continue improving these metrics as we go forward. Through the actions of our supervisors, we will always weigh customer need and the cost required to do so. Overall, I\u2019m satisfied we\u2019re on the right trajectory. We have opportunities and plans in sight for our network infrastructure and as well our operations leaders\u2019 ability to improve. Turning over to the next slide, we continue to work with Kevin and the sales and marketing team to align our operations with the needs of our customers. Preferred service and cost discipline are always at the forefront. We strive to understand exactly how our customers work and what they need from us. Having this information in the hand of field level supervisors and stressing connectivity with their customers allows us to provide a very high-level of first and last mile service. Our Trip Plan performance, like the dwell metric, reflects the same effect from a continuous focus on cost and customer need. We\u2019ve identified areas of opportunity to improve or rely on more specific first mile and last mile metrics along with customer feedback and engagement to ensure we are delivering the needed service. You can see in our CSD numbers that our strong customer engagement and level of service are taking place. In closing, we have much work to do as we always will. With that said, I\u2019m really excited now that our operations leadership team has been together for close to six months. I can see the improvement being made to clarify the importance of our tasks and to increase our information visibility. I can also see the deep thirst for learning from all our supervisors at all levels. And this, to me, is probably the most important factor going forward. This team fully believes our approach to a safe, balanced, and efficient customer focused railroad as many opportunities for improvement ahead, and our plan is to deliver on every one of them. With that, over to you, Kevin. Kevin Boone : Thank you, Mike. As Joe referenced, we are really seeing a lot of positive momentum, particularly around sales and marketing collaborating with operations. Highlighting these initiatives are the market reviews where our teams come together to discuss and evaluate opportunities to collaborate on operational efficiencies while delivering new solutions to target profitable business. Driving network efficiencies allows us to deliver a more competitive service product and expand the opportunity for growth. We are continuing to be very aggressive in pushing forward on our truck conversions, new industrial development projects, and creative solutions with the growing number of shippers who want to maximize their use of CSX rail. As you\u2019ve heard from a number of our peers and competitors across the transportation industry over these past weeks, the trucking market remains challenged and industrial markets are mixed as we move into the second half of the year. Accumulating effects of interest rates including a sluggish housing market and fluctuating commodity prices creates headwinds for some of the markets we serve. It\u2019s a volatile environment, but we continue to drive initiatives to accelerate modal share and expand CSX\u2019s addressable market. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 7, and look at our merchandise performance. We had a great result with revenues up 5% on a 1% increase in volume. RPU was higher by 4% even with fuel surcharge lower year-over-year. As we continue to get pricing results that reflect the strong service that the team is delivering. Throughout the second quarter, our chemicals franchise has performed very well as momentum has persisted in plastics, industrial chemicals, waste, and energy markets. Minerals revenues also saw positive results driven by industrial development wins and our unique network access into the southeast markets including Florida where we see a multi-year glide path for growth. Our Forest Products business began to accelerate driven by demand in pulp board and recent wins in the northeast portion of our network. We\u2019ve been developing some very promising strategic partnerships in this market to take advantage of the capacity that our network has available, which puts us in a good position to gain more truck share as the housing market rebounds. Our Automotive business saw 4% revenue growth, leveraging our strong service product to deliver a competitive win with a key customer. Less favorable this quarter was metals, where high inventories and expectations of weaker steel prices weighed on volumes. This is probably the market with the most near-term uncertainty as we watch trends in coil, plate, and scrap prices for a recovery. Fertilizer volumes continue to be hurt by phosphate production issues here in Florida. As in past quarters, lower volumes of this short haul of business, does have a favorable mix effect on the total fertilizer RPU. And Ag and Food remains soft on unfavorable regional crop supply dynamics. So, we are very encouraged by the fundamentals into the back half of the year where we see a weaker southeastern crop leading to incremental opportunities for growth. For the remainder of the year, despite a sluggish economy and persistently weak trucking market, we expect to capitalize on our best-in-class service to deliver growth. Chemicals should remain strong supported by business wins, steady plastics and healthy waste moves. We also see opportunities in our Forest Product segment where we see operational focus differentiating us in the market. We\u2019re also anticipating a much better second half for our Ag and Food business with demand supported by larger hog and chicken herds in the Southeast, which will need feed grain supplies from the Midwest. Turning to Slide 8 in the coal business. First, I want to reiterate Joe\u2019s comments from the beginning of the call. Our team in Baltimore did a fantastic job of finding creative solutions to move coal after the Key Bridge collapse. Their efforts made a huge difference in reducing the negative impact that this incident had on CSX and the customers we serve. As we highlighted at a conference earlier this spring, operations at Curtis Bay were up and running at the end of May, several weeks ahead of our original projections. For the quarter, revenues were down 12%. We estimate that without the Key Bridge collapse, the year-over-year decline would have been more in the range of 5%. Volume was down only 3% with the decline driven by domestic shipments largely to utilities. Key here is that our team was able to grow export volume by 8% year-over-year which is an extraordinary result given the closure of the Port of Baltimore. Our PE was 9% lower year-over-year and 6% lower sequentially in-line with our expectations and driven by export benchmark prices and unfavorable utility mix. Looking ahead, the key benchmark for high-quality Australian coal remains above $200 per metric ton. Given the lag in our export coal contracts, we expect a mid-to-high single-digit sequential decline for all in coal RPU in the third quarter. The temporary idling of a recently opened export mine on our network should have little impact on our export volumes as we see strong production offsets at other CSX served mines. Just as we did this last quarter, the team is already finding some creative ways to pivot towards other opportunities in the marketplace where we see strong demand for export capacity at our Curtis Bay terminal. On the domestic side, low natural gas prices continue to impact volumes, but we\u2019ve seen some good signs from the hot summer with several utilities in our service region maximizing their coal units in response to very strong demand. We\u2019ve also seen inventory levels moderate from the highs seen earlier in the year. Finally turning to Intermodal on Slide 9, revenue increased 3% on 5% volume growth. RPU declined 2% as we felt the effects of lower fuel surcharge revenue and negative mix. Our International business drove our volume growth this quarter supported by higher East Coast import activity and favorable alignment with our steamship line partners. This has been the trend through the year and we\u2019ve been pleased to see customer activity remain solid so far in the Q3. In contrast, momentum in our domestic intermodal business remains muted as weak trucking conditions persist. The weak trucking market has continued much longer than what was expected coming into the year, but in the meantime, we\u2019ll keep pushing hard in a tough environment, leading with our best-in-class service. All-in, the collective team has been capitalizing on opportunities throughout the year, working together to win business and gain share for CSX. With mixed conditions across end markets, we\u2019ve been able to grow total volume by 3% year-to-date while setting ourselves up for more profitable growth over the longer-term by demonstrating to our customers that CSX stands apart for our service, creativity, efficiency, and capacity. Now, let me turn it over to, Sean. Sean Pelkey : Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. As Mike and the operations team continue to drive efficiency with strong service, we\u2019re challenging ourselves to hold support costs in-line and grow revenue through pricing gains and new business wins. As Joe noted, we\u2019ve built momentum over the last several quarters and we\u2019re looking ahead to strong year-over-year growth in the second half of the year, as we finally cycle some of the discrete items that helped our results in prior years. Revenue was flat in the Q2 while operating income was down 1% when compared to revised prior year results. Merchandise and Intermodal revenue ex fuel was up 5% and was partially offset by about a $100 million of unfavorable impacts related to lower export coal benchmark pricing and the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. Declines in other revenue, fuel recovery, and trucking drove an additional revenue headwind of nearly $60 million. Expenses were 1% higher, and I will discuss the line items in more detail on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $11 million higher compared to the prior year, while income tax expense fell by $8 million. As a result, earnings per share was up 9% sequentially and stable year-over-year at $0.49. Let\u2019s now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. As noted in the quarterly financial report, our review of the accounting treatment for engineering scrap and certain engineering support labor drove immaterial adjustments to previously reported financial statements. Second quarter 2023 expense was revised up by $16 million and going forward we expect a similar quarterly expense impact split between labor and PS&O. The labor portion will result in lower capital expenditures, and the adjustments for engineering scrap and labor did not impact cash flow. Total second quarter expense increased by $20 million. Turning to the individual line items, labor and fringe was up $18 million as costs from increased headcount and inflation were partly offset by lower incentive compensation and other items. Headcount declined slightly from the first quarter and is expected to remain relatively stable through the remainder of the year. We expect to deliver labor efficiency gains in the second half while continuing to ensure the training pipeline is stable to offset attrition and support future growth. Also, as a reminder, our union employees are receiving a 4.5% wage increase effective on July 1st, and that will be reflected in a higher sequential cost per employee. Purchase services and other expense increased $8 million as broad based efficiency savings and a favorable insurance recovery, mostly offset cost from inflation, a write-off of inventory in the quarter and other items. Depreciation was up $6 million due to a larger asset base. Fuel cost was down $11 million driven by a lower gallon price and improved efficiency, partly offset by costs related to higher volume. Through a combination of operating initiatives and effectively leveraging fuel saving technologies, we matched our best quarter of fuel efficiency over the last three calendar years. Finally, equipment and rents decreased by $5 million, while property gains were unfavorable by $4 million. Now, turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 13, free cash flow year to-date is $1.15 billion. This reflects lower net earnings and deferred tax payments made this year, partially offset by the prior year impact of back wage payouts. As expected, capital expenditures are also higher year-over-year as we continue to prioritize investments for the safety, reliability, and long-term growth of our railroad. After fully funding these investments, we distributed nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders year-to-date, and we remain committed to our balanced and opportunistic approach to returning excess cash. A long-term focus on economic profit further aligns our interest with our shareholders. While economic profit is lower year-to-date as we cycle prior year comparisons, the team is strategically focused on growing this measure over time. We expect second half economic profit to be up versus the prior year as profitable growth is paired with disciplined asset utilization and attractive returns on our capital investments. With that, let me turn it back to Joe, for his closing remarks. Joseph R. Hinrichs: Alright. Thank you, Sean. Now, we will wind up our prepared remarks by reviewing our guidance for the full year 2024. If you look at Slide 16, we expect total volume and total revenue growth in the low to mid-single digit range for the second half of the year. Total first half revenue was slightly below our original expectations, largely due to lower fuel prices. The macroeconomic environment does appear a little more uncertain than it did a few months ago. That said, as Kevin described, in merchandise, we see promise across chemicals, forest products, ag and food, and minerals markets supported by increasing customer activity, the ramp up of new projects, and a growing portfolio of business wins. On the other hand, metals and fertilizers have both lagged and appear likely to remain softer through the end of the year. We expect momentum to gradually build in Intermodal supported by strong port activity and the strength of our service performance, which is facilitating new ways of working together with our channel partners. This is allowing us to drive small but meaningful modal conversions even while the truck market still remains soft. The reopening of the Port of Baltimore, return to full operations at Curtis Bay and consistent domestic demand should lead to a modest pickup in coal shipments in the second half of the year. We continue to price according to our leading service, work better together as a ONE CSX team and push forward on our efficiency initiatives. As a result, we expect to deliver a meaningful operating margin expansion on a year-over-year basis in the second half, supported by a very strong incremental margin on our revenues. Our CapEx forecast of approximately $2.5 billion is unchanged as is our balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns. We are encouraged by our accomplishments over the first half of the year. Now, we are very focused on executing our plan over the rest of 2024 as we position ourselves for sustained, profitable growth over the long-term. We have the capacity, the operating model, leadership team and the culture we need to ensure that we are the best run railroad in North America. We look forward to sharing more details about our strategy at our upcoming Investor Day in November. Thanks for your interest in our company. Matthew, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Matthew Korn : Thank you, Joe. We will now move to our question-and-answer session. In the interest of time and to make sure that everyone on this call has the opportunity to take part, we ask you to please limit yourselves to one and only one question. JL, we\u2019re ready to start the process. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So, maybe with Kevin, just wanted to see if you\u2019re feeling any impact or seeing any impact from the potential, East and Gulf Coast labor disruption? Doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s the case, but wanted to see if there\u2019s anything in particular that you\u2019re hearing from customers. And, maybe to that point, we\u2019ve seen a lot of international volume. You gave the reasons for that, but when do you think some of that would start to spill over into the domestic side? Kevin Boone : Yes. I guess that\u2019s a magic question, right? When does the domestic market recover, given what we\u2019ve seen on the export or the import side of the business. I think, I don\u2019t we\u2019re still not hearing from customers a major shift, in their activity from the east to the west. If that were to occur, I think it probably presents maybe more opportunities than risk for our business, especially if some things want to move further into the eastern part of our network where today that\u2019s truck. So, it\u2019s a watch item for us. We\u2019ll be close with Mike and his team and able to capitalize on that if we see a shift, which this team is well prepared to capitalize on. Yes, we all listen to the earnings calls from our customers on the domestic side, and I think, we all came into the year a little bit more optimistic on the recovery. It will come, but it\u2019s been pushed to the right. That\u2019s for sure. And, I think, hopefully, the import business will be a precursor to, some better days ahead on the domestic side, but we\u2019re not yet seeing that uplift necessarily as you\u2019ve heard from a lot of our customers, on their earnings calls. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So, Sean, the comments about meaningful margin improvement in the back half, any just directional color what that means? And, I know every quarter you give us some thoughts on sort of the sequential puts and takes for margins and earnings, two good quarters in a row with cost ex fuel coming down? Do you think that continues, stuff like that? Thank you. Sean Pelkey : Sure, Scott. Yes. I mean, I we\u2019re not going to give a pinpoint estimate on meaningful improvement in margins or we would have done that, obviously. But, we feel good about the setup for the second half of the year, and I think what\u2019s exciting is some of the sort of dust that\u2019s been in the year in terms of year-over-year comparison starts to clear in the second half of the year, and you\u2019ll see the core momentum that we continue to build both on the cost side, but also, the pricing action, supportive of the service reflective of the service that we\u2019re delivering as well as the growth that we\u2019re seeing in the business. That\u2019ll drop through at very attractive incremental margins. Sequentially, second to the third quarter, you got a couple things going on that are probably worth remembering. One is Kevin\u2019s guidance on the coal RPU, which will be down mid to high-single digits. That\u2019ll be a big impact. We got the wage step up. For us, that\u2019ll be about 20 million. Fuel, we have positive lag in the second quarter. So, depending on where prices go, that could be a headwind as well. That said, we\u2019re holding the line on expenses. The things that we can control, obviously, we can\u2019t control the wage increase or fuel prices. But outside of that, we feel good about, the run rate that we\u2019re at in terms of second quarter for core expenses. And, our focus is on, growing year-over-year and delivering that growth at strong incrementals. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chappell of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Jonathan Chappell : Thank you. Kevin and maybe looping Mike in here as well. Back on the opportunities, I think there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around what could happen with the port. There\u2019s probably a perception that the East Coast rails are hit more directly. But as you mentioned, there\u2019s probably more kind of long haul as it relates to intermodal, etcetera. Can you just tell us how you think about the opportunities and risks of this as it gets closer and what it does to the network as far as keeping balance and resources that are required if there were to be a stoppage and you did have to kind of shift more to a Chicago focus as opposed to, some of the East Coast ports? Kevin Boone : Yeah. I\u2019ll let Mike, follow-up. But from a capacity standpoint, we\u2019re working really close, with our team. I think we\u2019re well-positioned to adjust as we have in the past, when these events happen, temporarily. But, like you mentioned, there\u2019s opportunities probably for some longer haul, business should, we see a disruption on the East Coast and some more volumes that would traditionally move east local. Think about the New York markets and maybe some of the southeastern markets that are locally trucked, that would have to move through the West Coast. That that\u2019s an opportunity for all of us to participate, and we\u2019ll be more than ready to do that. But I\u2019ll hand it over to, Mike to talk about capacity. Mike Cory : Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Hi, Jon. What\u2019s the capacity, Jon? We have the odd train, train pair, let\u2019s say, that\u2019s, at a higher rate of using capacity. But for the most part, our network can withstand whatever Kevin brings us in terms of intermodal. We\u2019ve done a lot of work at our terminals. Our intermodal team is really dug in deep here over the last six, eight months to provide that great first and the last mile for the customer. But in terms of the capacity over the network, it\u2019s there for us to get, get the business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Chris Wetherbee : Yes. Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I guess real quick, I don\u2019t know if you gave it. I apologize if I missed it. Could you give us the number of the accounting change for the quarter, the impact on 2Q? And, then I guess I was curious about, how you think about pricing sort of going forward? As you see, service product continue to be very solid. There\u2019s some opportunities on the volume side. I know you do most of the re-pricing probably towards year-end. Are you seeing any of that acceleration in terms of the year-over-year growth that you\u2019re able to capture on new contracts as they be as they are being signed to through 2Q and into 3Q? Sean Pelkey : Chris, it\u2019s Sean. I\u2019ll take the restatement first. So, what I mentioned was a $16 million impact in the prior year split between labor and PS&O. Even though there was no restatement for Q2, obviously, because we\u2019re reporting Q2 results of this year for the first time, that impact was similar in the second quarter, and that\u2019s pretty similar to what we expect on a go-forward basis as well. I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin for pricing. Kevin Boone : Yes. On the second question, clearly, facing a truck market when you\u2019re trying to convert truck is not the most ideal backdrop to do that, but we\u2019ve had a lot of success. And, you\u2019re going to see that success really build momentum as that market comes back. So, and on the intermodal side, not as strong of a pricing environment, which we\u2019ve been pretty transparent about. On the merchandise side, given our service, given the value we\u2019re providing to customers, given the efficiency we\u2019re driving for them, we\u2019re having really good discussions around there. And, you\u2019re right. A lot of that re-pricing every year comes out at the end of the year in the first part of next year. But, with inflation coming down, those things, those will be factors as well, but we still nothing\u2019s really changed from our strategy there. We want to go after volume and price, and deliver the value to our customers so they are, see the value in, giving us more business along with, obviously covering the cost and the inflation that we will have to absorb every year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Your line is open. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Good afternoon. Wanted to see, Mike, if you could offer some thoughts on how you think the network is running? I think some of the metrics show a little bit of deterioration in terms of, like, on time arrivals or carload trip plan compliance. I wonder if you think, why you think that would be the case and whether you would expect those metrics to rebound as you look into 3Q and 4Q? Mike Cory : Sure. Thanks for the question, Tom. Look, we have really made a lot of changes here the last six months, most focused on two things. Well, safety first, as though you can\u2019t tell by our metrics on that. But service, whatever we do in terms of whether it\u2019s we make changes to the operating plan, which in some cases has caused trains not to run on time right down to making sure that the assets that we have out there are being pushed. So, locomotives being stored. We\u2019re doing things right now just to test the railway. And, yes, there\u2019s been some drop in some of the metrics, and, yes, they will improve, as we go forward. But, we have opportunities here, first of all, with a very young group of people to learn how to do this properly, and second, for them to partake in it. So, the changes we\u2019re making, yes, they\u2019re having some effect, nothing material, but some effect on some of our lagging indicators. But, what we\u2019re able to do from a cost perspective and still maintain that service is powerful. And, really by focusing on the connectivity between our fields people and their customers, we\u2019re starting to see the more benefits come out. So, yes, we\u2019ll get our metrics back, but at the same time, we\u2019re not running for a metric. We\u2019re running for service. We\u2019re running for a return, and that\u2019s very important. And so, Tom, for me just learning as I go. I\u2019ve been here 10 months now. I\u2019m not overly concerned. Trust me. It\u2019s a focus, as we go through to improve those metrics. And, prior to this storm we had going, we had a pretty good, pretty good July, on those regards. So, metrics will improve, but focus is on cost and service and safety. And, we\u2019ll figure out the right metrics from there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan of Stifel. Your line is open. Ben Nolan : Yes. I appreciate it. Thank you, guys. I was going to ask a little bit on the chemical side. That has been working pretty well for you guys. It was curious how you would, do you think it\u2019s just fundamentally there\u2019s just a lot more chemicals to be moved, or is this share gains maybe relative to the trucking side of the business or maybe competitors? And, any framing that you can, talk to on the chemical side would be helpful. Joseph R. Hinrichs: Yes. I mean, I think you first got to start with last year. Obviously, that was a difficult backdrop for our chemical market, but we have seen some wins on the industrial, development side, that are really starting to, help us there. So, that\u2019s been positive in the plastics market, so we\u2019ve really capitalized on those opportunities. And, I think it\u2019s all of the above that you mentioned. We obviously have quality carriers and, that alignment with them, that understanding of the market has helped us in our conversations with customers. In fact, there\u2019s a recent customer where we\u2019re kind of bundling that opportunity together and allows us for us to work together in a white boarding session to really look at their total network and how we can make that real more rail centric over time. So, those are exciting things. Some of the things that we\u2019ve been working on for a long time that are really, picking up momentum, but it\u2019s really all of the above. It starts with the leading service in the in the east, and we\u2019re really, delivering on that, and that allows us to have a really different conversation with our customers than we were able to a year or two ago. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Morgan of Barclays. Your line is open. Eric Morgan : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on Industrial Development. Just wondering if you could offer any update on some of those projects. I don\u2019t think the merchandise slide called out the, that 1% contribution to merchandise volumes you called out last quarter. So, just wondering if that\u2019s still the target. And then, curious just any other progress you\u2019ve made since last quarter, anything incremental that might have you tracking closer to the low or high-end of that 1% to 2% range you\u2019ve talked about for, I think \u201825 or \u201926? Kevin Boone : Yes. I mean, Joe mentioned at Investor Day in November, and we\u2019re certainly going to put probably more of a bow on the story and, kind of open up, a lot more of the details and share with all of you. But, we are seeing that acceleration, this year, year-over-year, in that range that I mentioned. And, when you look at full run rate and some of these projects can take a year or two to really get up to full run rate volume, But, the pickup in terms of things that we\u2019re seeing put in place this year has certainly accelerated this year, and we anticipate that\u2019ll accelerate next year and then the following year. So, that means, several years of growth as those projects really come up to full rate production. On average, a lot of these projects are $2 million. So, it\u2019s a lot of small things that add up to a fairly large number. We do have the larger projects in there as well, but it\u2019s a very diverse, set of projects, opportunities that are that are coming online across a number of our merchandise network segments. So it\u2019s exciting. We still see the momentum out there. I think, it\u2019s going to be fun to talk about it in November and, and share more of those details with you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Your line is open. Ken Hoexter : Hey, great. Good afternoon. Sean, can you just, I guess, can you clarify when you say, meaningful improvement, in answering Scott\u2019s question, but you didn\u2019t say if you were going to see sequential improvement or decline. I just want to clarify if you were suggesting you\u2019re going to see improvement sequentially. And then when you mentioned labor flattish, do you still see opportunities to cut costs there, or can we see progress on that, or is this kind of the refined level you expect to run at? Thanks. Sean Pelkey : Yes. Ken, I\u2019ll take the sequential part first. We\u2019re not going to guide specifically to sequential. I did lay out a couple of the factors there that are be somewhat, challenging from 2Q to 3Q, comes with a wage step up, the net fuel, and the coal RPU. That being said, core expenses, we should trend pretty similarly to Q2. And, we\u2019ll see what happens in terms of the demand side of the equation. But, again, feel good about low to mid-single digit volume and revenue growth year-over-year in the second half. And then, in terms of the labor opportunities, I think there\u2019s always, continued opportunities to drive efficiencies on labor. Mike\u2019s clearly focused on overtime reductions out there. We\u2019re seeing momentum across many of the crafts. He\u2019s also got a team looking very closely at how do we increase retention across the craft workforce T&E in particular. There\u2019s significant cost in training those employees, and retention is extraordinarily important, not just from an operating, standpoint, but also from a cost and efficiency standpoint. So, definitely opportunities going forward on the labor side even if it\u2019s not headcount. I think headcount will be pretty stable, and we will drive year-over-year improvements in headcount efficiencies where we do expect volume to grow more than headcount in the second half. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Your line is open. Brady Lierz : Okay, great. Thanks. This is Brady on for Daniel. I wanted to ask, as we\u2019ve gone through earnings season, we\u2019ve heard some anecdotes about the truck market maybe moving a little closer to balance than it has been over the last couple of years and maybe even showing some signs of seasonality again. I wanted to ask, have you seen or heard any anecdotes from customers to suggest truck to rail conversions are picking up sequentially or could pick up in the back half? Thanks. Sean Pelkey : Yes. I listened to the same call as you did. I think they\u2019re obviously a lot closer to it, on a day to day basis, than we are. I think the environment\u2019s persisted a lot longer, than what we expected than everyone expected, quite frankly, and we\u2019re just, setting ourselves up for the recovery, and I think we\u2019re well positioned there. But I don\u2019t have any additional anecdotes to add to what we\u2019ve all heard. I\u2019m hopeful that, we\u2019re further along in this cycle than not. And I think we\u2019re set up, with what Mike mentioned on our intermodal ops side from a capacity standpoint, we\u2019re better positioned than we ever have to bring on the volume. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl of TD Cowen. Your line is open. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Joe, Kevin, Mike, Sean, good afternoon, gentlemen. Wanted to dig a little bit deeper, Joe, into a comment you made. You talked about it now. There appears to be, I guess, a little bit more uncertainty a quarter ago. Was that comment more related to what we\u2019ve seen sort of over the past two weeks with, PMI being negative again and the job number that we saw last week? Or was this from what your customers might be telling you? And if it is from the customers, maybe you could elaborate or just give us more color on that. Sean Pelkey : Yeah. Thanks, Jason. I think Kevin has highlighted a number of the areas. One area we didn\u2019t talk about was automotive. And while we had strong performance in the first half of the year, I think you\u2019ve seen the shipments over the last few weeks have been down a little bit coming out of their shutdown period. So, that\u2019s one we watch very carefully from the consumer side of things, interest rate sensitivity. You think about it, housing market, auto market are two big areas in our business that are very rate sensitive, so we\u2019re watching it very carefully. But my comment was, you know so that\u2019s in addition to all the stuff that Kevin talked about earlier. But my comment was more in general, I think. I mean we were thinking about this call. This is even before today\u2019s events, when the marketplace, I think there\u2019s just a little more uncertainty about where the economy really is. We see a number of areas that we\u2019re excited about for the second half of the year. But clearly, we\u2019re watching what happens with the Fed. We\u2019re watching what happens in the general economy. And, and so I think if you could say where we are today versus two months ago, the economy seems to be a little bit more fragile. And we\u2019re optimistic that, you know, it can pick itself up, but we\u2019re watching it very carefully. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Your line is open. Stephanie Moore : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. Maybe continuing on the same thing, would love to hear maybe some color that you\u2019re seeing from maybe some picked up infrastructure or general industrial investments that we\u2019ve seen across the southeast. Any commentary that would suggest maybe a slowdown in that activity or acceleration or the likes there, or any kind of thoughts as we kind of look forward? Thank you. Joseph R. Hinrichs: Not really any, slowdown. And I think we presented a slide last time that we do have a very, very diverse portfolio and there was a lot of focus on the EV market and certainly we\u2019ve seen some of that be pushed to the right, but our portfolio is much, much larger than, just the EV segment. So other areas, continue to stay on trend, on pace, and we\u2019ll, obviously have a ramp up period over time. But we have we have pretty clear line of sight. A lot of construction is already underway. So, a lot of some capital out there with these projects needing to be finished. So, we feel pretty good that despite maybe, even if the macro scene is a little bit weaker in the back half that these projects, in large part will continue on and be a positive factor for us in the back half and into the next year and the following year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital. Your line is open. Walter Spracklin : Yes, thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. I was wondering, I don\u2019t know if this is a question more for Mike or for Sean with regard to long-term OR where your OR could go. I know that you and a number of your peers were able to achieve a 55 OR at least on a quarterly basis, in the past. But now with cost inflation, new work rules and I\u2019m talking really just your rail operation if we would exclude your trucking from this conversation. If we look at the cost inflation, new work rules and the other factors that have come to play here in the current environment, do you still see your efforts and Mike you mentioned you\u2019re making great efforts on cost efficiency, on service and on safety. Can they translate into 55 again? Or is 60 the new 55 or something else? And maybe if you talk a little bit conceptually about not so much the target itself, but if these are real impediments to you achieving the run rates you\u2019ve had in the past. Mike Cory : Well, I\u2019ll start it off, Walter, and nice to hear you. Good that you\u2019re on the call. Look, no different than any other time. The margin is not what we\u2019re aiming for. We do see a pipeline in terms of efficiencies, and that\u2019s again, this is going to take time, but it\u2019s happening as we speak that we\u2019re developing supervisors to see these things, giving them the tools to be able to relate to them better. And I see a lot of the things I saw in my previous career. There\u2019s just opportunity here to connect people and activities where we get rid of waste. And that\u2019s our focus, and I\u2019ll turn it over to my financial friend here. Sean Pelkey : No. Thanks, Mike. I agree. I mean, margin obviously is an indicator of financial health and in our industry, it helps us to understand how efficient we\u2019re running the railroad. Clearly, as we\u2019re able to grow the business as well and do that at strong incrementals that\u2019s going to help the margin, but the margin really isn\u2019t the destination. The goal is to grow earnings, to grow economic profit, be disciplined around the way that we spend capital and look for opportunities to invest in things that have a high return, whether those are growth oriented projects or projects that help us to drive further efficiency gains, technology investments, capacity investments across the railroad. That\u2019s our primary focus. We think that\u2019s the quickest, surest way, to grow the value of the company. And in terms of things changing versus previously, I think you make a good point in terms of the impact of inflation on the rail operating ratio, operating margin equation. That being said, I don\u2019t see any reason why we can\u2019t continue to see improvement in that metric as we expect across many other metrics, in our financial performance over time if the formula, the equation that we have going for us right now is able to continue, and we\u2019ve got confidence that we\u2019ll be able to do that. Joseph R. Hinrichs: Yes. This is Joe. Last comment to add to that. I appreciate you recognizing, quality carriers as part of our equation when it comes to margins. If you look at our second quarter performance, even with now accounting for scrap and the related labor according to our policies, even looking at fuel being down, we had over 39% margin in our corporate results. But if you look at the as we\u2019ve said in the past, effective quality carriers is about a 250 basis point effect on our total margin. So, our rail operations, then if you just do that simple math, had over a 41% margin in the second quarter. In a clean quarter with not a lot of exceptional things going on or, like, a lot of those quarters that you\u2019re referencing in the past had high fuel surcharge or had a lot of demurrage or storage charges or even had record export coal prices and other things like that. We had a pretty stable quarter even with the Baltimore bridge collapse. And with our rail operations, even with the inflation that we\u2019ve had over the last couple of years, capable of delivering that kind of performance. And as we\u2019ve noted optimistic about how we continue to run this as forward, we\u2019re very excited about the margin potential of this business, and recognizing that service and our operating efficiency go hand in hand. Having said all of that, if the pursuit is just only to optimize the margin number, this industry or even this company has the potential to turn away good business. And I think it has in the past. If we had a 41% plus operating margin for our rail business last quarter and a 35% margin opportunity present itself, do we turn it down? And where our cost of capital is a lot lower than that, and most businesses don\u2019t have that kind of margin. It would deteriorate the average margin on the business, but still incrementally could be good business. And so that\u2019s where Sean\u2019s point, is very valid. We want to grow earnings, grow cash so we can return that to shareholders and reinvest in the business for profitable growth. And that\u2019s the kind of way we look at it. Efficiency matters. There\u2019s no question about it. So does safety, so does service. But the big opportunity at these margins is to create profitable growth, which has strong incremental more incremental margins. That\u2019s what we\u2019re excited about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. David Vernon : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Sean, I wanted to ask the incremental sort of operating leverage question a little bit differently. If you look at the first half of the year, volumes are up 2%, operating profit is down 4%. I know the bridge is in there, but if you think about what\u2019s been missing in the equation for operating leverage to drop down to the bottom line on that volume, what what\u2019s going to change in the second half of the year? Sean Pelkey : Yes. No. Good question, David. If you look at the first half, I mean, I get to about $300 million of kind of unique year-over-year challenges between the Baltimore collapse, the lower export coal pricing, decline in other revenue, net fuel, that\u2019s $300 million. Second half is not going to be anywhere near that significant. We will have coal pricing headwinds, but the rest is pretty clean. And then the other thing that\u2019s different, in the first half of the year, we were still cycling, some of the labor additions that that came on over the course of last year. So, our labor productivity was negative in the first half of the year. That\u2019s going to turn positive in the second half of the year, on our volume growth and, keeping headcount essentially flat from where we are right now. So, those are the two big factors there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ravi Shanker : Thanks, everyone. So maybe also piggybacking on that operating leverage question. I mean, just to kind of summarize the call a little bit, and it seems like a little bit of a mixed message from you guys on cycle sentiment. On the one hand, you did say that the it appears the kind of inflection is kind of pushed out a little bit and the economy is a little more fragile. On the other hand, you are guiding to some pretty strong operating leverage in the back half of the year. Just trying to get a sense of how much visibility you have on that operating leverage because general, in comments you indicated that\u2019s driven a lot by volume and price. And in a fragile market that maybe a little hard to come by, especially given some of the puts and takes in the end market there. Just trying to get a sense of how much confidence and visibility you have on that operating leverage in the back half. Sean Pelkey : There\u2019s been a lot of puts and takes, this is Sean, on a year-to-date basis, but, we\u2019re pretty much right on our plan in terms of both total volume and revenue, which is which is great. We had a stretch plan in place, across the teams, and we\u2019ve done a good job when there have been challenges of figuring out ways to offset them. Kevin did a good job of describing that with the key bridge outage in in Baltimore and what we did to adjust there. And we think we\u2019ll be able to continue to do that as the year goes forward. And I think I think we also talked about a number of the opportunities. There are some markets that are setting up quite well for us in the second half of the year. It\u2019s not guaranteed until we actually move the freight, but we\u2019ve got a couple areas of strength between ag and food and minerals and chemicals continuing to show nice year-over-year growth. There\u2019s some headwinds and some uncertainties out there as well. So, nothing\u2019s ever a given, but we\u2019re not only focused on growing the volumes. We\u2019re also focused on getting the price that we need to get in the marketplace. A lot of that price for this year has already been locked in, and then driving efficiency in the cost base. And we\u2019ve already seen pretty significant improvements from where we entered the year to where we\u2019re exiting the first half of the year that give us confidence we\u2019ll be able to hold the line there into the second half. So, if the macro is not as supportive and maybe we don\u2019t see as much growth as we expect, Will we still be able to deliver margin improvement? Yes. I think we will. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much for squeezing me in. Mike, just a quick question. You talked about excess capacity. Actually, it might have been Kevin mentioned that. We have plenty of capacity on the line. And I noticed that, dwell was up a little bit. So, I guess my question is, are there opportunities you said you\u2019re testing the railroad, here and there, seeing what it can do, to run with fewer locomotives or fewer cars or maybe technology can help you drive efficiency on the asset side. I\u2019m not talking so much about the people side here because you mentioned that earlier. But I was just kind of wondering, because cars online were up about 3,000 cars sequentially. I don\u2019t know if that was seasonal or not. But what kinds of opportunities do you see for improved asset utilization on the rail? Mike Cory : Thanks, Jeff. Just to clarify, what I what we\u2019re speaking about before was an intermodal shift. So, I was speaking specifically about our intermodal trains and the capacity that we have in that network. But everything you talked about, the answer is, yes. Do we want to run with fewer locomotives? Will there be technology that enhances what it is we\u2019re doing? Absolutely. The biggest thing we\u2019re focused on right now is outside of the day to day sweeping the corners, making sure people understand what the standards are and how to go about, achieving them. We\u2019re looking at infrastructure that we have. And so there there\u2019s some opportunities to reduce out of route miles, reduce a lot of handlings, essentially create mass where we don\u2019t have it today. This railroad has customers everywhere versus it being linear where you can accumulate all your traffic, you can switch it out, and it runs. So, we\u2019re going to try. We are looking at our network to see areas where we can bring and create mass in certain places and eliminate all those touches that we do. We do a lot of work online and road with trains block swapping because we just don\u2019t have the mass at the origin terminal. So, there\u2019s opportunities there and at our in our Investor Day or when we get together, we\u2019ll lay out far more than just me talking about it. We\u2019ll show you what we\u2019re talking about there. Operator : Thank you. With no further questions, this concludes our Q&A session and the conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Corporation Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. You may begin. Matthew Korn : Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and good afternoon. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me on this call are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In the presentation accompanying this call and available on our website, you will find slides with our forward-looking disclosures and our non-GAAP disclosures for your review. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs. Joe Hinrichs : All right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter call today. First, I want to thank our entire ONE CSX team who've been tireless in helping our employees and their communities recover from the hardships caused by two hurricanes in a matter of weeks. Helene, in particular, had a big impact on our network, and we'll talk more about that today. We have largely recovered, and we have made sure that CSX has been able to support our railroaders who have needed the systems for themselves and their families. That said, there's more work that we will need to do to repair and replace some of the physical infrastructure that we lost, which Mike and Sean will discuss later on this call. Now stepping back and looking at this entire quarter, I am proud of what we accomplished. Our aim was to grow volume, revenue and operating margin compared to last year, and that is exactly what we delivered. Our merchandise franchise continues to grow at an impressive pace, benefiting from our service leadership and the numerous initiatives that Kevin and his team are pursuing to bring new business to CSX. Operationally, our efficiency and cost controls remain solid we're still only getting started with some of the ways that we are using valuable, real-time data to optimize our network. We have had our challenges. This quarter, we had to adapt and respond to significant weather events, equipment issues at our coal terminal and lower diesel prices. Throughout, we've kept our focus on our long-term goals to deliver consistent, sustainable, profitable growth over time. Now let's go over some of the highlights. On Slide 1, it shows our key results from our third quarter compared to last year. Despite the severe weather, we were still able to publish some very good results across the Company. Looking across the highlights listed on this top line. Total volume grew by 3% versus last year, where by strong performance in our core merchandise business where volume also grew by 3%. Merchandise revenue grew by impressive 6%, supported by 3% growth in volume and favorable pricing. Our operating margin reached 37.4%, inclusive of our trucking business and improved 180 basis points compared to last year, demonstrating strong year-over-year expansion as our guidance indicated. Now these charts summarize a solid quarter for CSX. Total revenue reached over $3.6 billion for the quarter, up 1% from the same period last year, even with lower fuel surcharge and coal prices. Operating income increased by 7% compared to last year as we delivered strong general margins from top line growth and cost control. Earnings per share grew by 12%, supported by solid results for the business and our commitment capital returns. Our results this quarter demonstrate strong execution that we build powerful momentum behind our proven operating model. We remain motivated as a team, keeping in mind that I've told you since I joined CSX over two years ago, talented people working together as ONE CSX team with a common goal can accomplish just about anything. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike to provide details around our operational performance. Mike Cory : Thank you, Joe, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. So, here's a rundown on the operating activities in the quarter. Let me start first, though, by thanking our ONE CSX team for their extremely hard work and their teamwork to deliver solid results through a challenging quarter at times and specifically in certain locations. So, let's go to the first slide on safety. For FRA injuries, not much has changed since the last quarter in terms of metrics. Although we see a higher frequency than our desired target, we're finding the injury severity rate is lower. And as a result, we've seen a reduction in lost days of work for injured employees. For FRA train accidents, we continue to see a year-over-year decrease in incidents. Our biggest improvement has been driven by a reduction in human factor, yard train accidents. Through our safe CSX initiative, we are improving our ability to reduce workplace exposures, and this will continue to drive positive results across the network. We recorded our lowest number of human factor train accidents in September and human factor incidents are our leading cause. And that progress is really great, and it's a great achievement by our employees here at CSX. So looking at the next slide. Our rail road remains fluid, albeit we have had and still have some weather-related challenges. Our overall velocity considering the effects of the weather showed the resiliency of our network. Our ability to maintain our fluidity came directly from the effective response of our field forces and our ops teams and manage changes to our service plan to provide needed service to our customers in an efficient manner throughout this period. Collectively, we're able to ensure our strategy of safe restoration of service was accomplished without injury or accident. And while network speed is extremely important, our focus has been equally strong, ensuring our major engineering work gets accomplished according to the plan. With multiple weather constraints, we were able to stay on plan while maintaining our network velocity. While our dwell metric was affected by weather, we did see an increase of 3% more carloads and moved it with 2% less train starts. So, we continue to manage the inventories in our yards for our customers and always, always look for a more efficient way to move the cars. Whether aside, the team is focused on service and efficiency, and the lessons learned from our response and actions as a team will certainly help in the development of our operating leaders going forward. Over to the last slide, we continue to work with our sales and marketing team to align our operations with the needs of our customers. Excellent service and cost discipline are always at the forefront. Our metrics do reflect weather-related difficulties However, our field forces, as I mentioned earlier, worked extremely efficiently to get us back operating as fast as possible. But the big thing is we did this collectively as a team, with our service group staying close to our customers and communicating important two-way information throughout. Our vast network resilience and faster recovery over our network has allowed us to remain in line with our customers' needs throughout this weather. And I'm very proud of how well the entire team has come together and work to provide service throughout some challenging disruptions. Communication between our service network and field operations team is very strong and continues to strengthen. These last couple of months have provided plenty of opportunities to show what we can do with and for our customers. So, all in all, I'm very proud of the team, and I'm thankful for their efforts in this tough, but very good quarter. Thank you, and over to you, Kevin. Kevin Boone : All right. Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter, as Joe and Mike both mentioned, we were presented with a number of challenges from storms, a strike at our East Coast ports and another temporary outage at our Curtis Bay terminal. We are very proud of the level of communication throughout the CSX team and our focus on serving our customers through these challenges. This was highlighted by our most recent customer survey out just this week with our Net Promoter Score at the highest level since we started measuring. With major storms impacting our network, we are working with our customers on the rebuilding efforts to ensure CSX is able to deliver the building materials and other essential supplies to the areas where they are needed. There's been a lot to manage through even for a railroad with experience of CSX. But working together, we've been able to find creative solutions to keep freight flowing. At a high level, market conditions remain a bit mixed we are seeing continued strength in some of our merchandise markets. And while truck rates appear to have bottomed, there remains a soft market. Diesel and natural gas prices remain low and benchmark coal prices have moderated. All that said, we grew total volumes and revenue over the quarter as our service-led initiatives continue to bring new business to our railroad. The team has continued to build momentum by working with our customers as we're going to continue to push hard against the mixed economic backdrop. And I'm excited about our upcoming Investor Day, where you will hear more from our commercial leaders who are laying the foundation to deliver profitable growth for CSX. Let's first review our merchandise business, as shown on Slide 7. As a whole, merchandise continues to be a great contributor for us. As we anticipated, volume growth accelerated this quarter, supported by new business wins, truck conversions, and the ramp-up of industrial development projects. Revenue gained 6% compared to last year, driven by a 3% gain in volume and solid pricing. Note that with lower diesel prices, fuel surcharge was a drag on both total revenue and reported RPU. On a core basis, our same-store basis, our merchandise pricing remains solid. Chemicals continued its positive performance for the year, delivering a 9% volume increase year-over-year. We see consistent broad strength across plastics, industrial, industrial chemicals, LPGs and waste. And ag and food, the second half inflection has taken off as we had hoped with volume also up 9%, led by grain and feed ingredients that customers turn to the Midwest for supplies. Close collaboration with our operating team has ensured consistent service as the strong seasonal demand has kicked in. Those products also saw great year-over-year growth with healthy improvement in pulp board demand contributing to a 9% volume gain. Some of this new forest product business is shorter length of haul, which was a factor in 3Q reported RPU. Results in our Minerals business were mixed with volume up 1%. Cement is doing very well, supported by construction demand and the ramp up of new customer facilities, but wet rainy weather was a modest drag on aggregate shipments over the quarter. All that said, the underlying long-term trend remains very favorable. Other markets we serve are facing more near-term challenges. As we've highlighted through much of this year, the metals market, particularly steel, remains soft with sluggish demand, ample supply and low commodity prices. One reason for softer metals demand is a weaker-than-anticipated automotive market where conditions have deteriorated. Volumes inflected negatively for us this quarter and mix was also a modest headwind to auto RPU. As Joe mentioned at an investor conference last month, the industry has seen consumer demand diminish by high retail prices and interest rates which has led to higher dealer inventories and slower production. Our belief is that interest rate easing cycle will help these markets normalize. Lastly, total fertilizer volume continued to trend negatively in the third quarter. So, we were able to pick up some favorable spot moves. For the remainder of the year, we expect to see a carryover of solid year-over-year momentum in chemicals, ag and food, forest products and Minerals, while trains and metals continue to be challenged in the near term. Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review the coal business. For the third quarter, total coal revenue declined 7%, a 2% decline in volume. As shown in our financial report, we saw export and domestic shipments move in opposite directions with export tonnage increasing by 10% year-over-year and domestic tonnage decreasing by 12%. Low natural gas prices continue to limit the utility burn. All-in coal RPU was down 5% compared to last year and 7.5% sequentially, in line with our guidance last quarter and largely driven by the declines in global benchmarks for metallurgical coal. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, market seem relatively stable. Utility stockpiles are sufficient and though natural gas prices recently approach the $3 mark, do not anticipate any near-term step-up in volumes. Export demand remains consistent, particularly from buyers in Asia and the Australian benchmark has stabilized around the $200 level toward the end of the last quarter. Given the lag in our export contracts, we anticipate a modest to low single-digit sequential decline of all-in coal RPU in the fourth quarter. Turning to intermodal on Slide 9. Total revenue declined 2% year-over-year, while volume increased 3%. International shipments grew at a solid mid-single-digit rate, while domestic shipments ended up effectively flat for the quarter. As we talked about in past calls, we did see a shift towards West Coast arrivals over the summer, which lifted our transcontinental interchange businesses to the East. We also opened up new business with several customer partners. Overall, we did see the domestic business gain modest momentum over the quarter but activity with some of our main channel partners remains relatively soft. Total intermodal RPU decreased 5%, largely due to lower fuel surcharge and a mix with international outgrowing the domestic business. We're pleased to see a relatively quick short-term solution for the ILA as we did see the effects on our volumes during the strike. The trucking backdrop has remained challenged through 2024, but we do see signs of market conditions bottoming and are well prepared to handle more volumes as the market continues to improve, and the team continues to find new business for the CSX intermodal network. Summing it up, the team performed very well this quarter, especially given the number of external challenges we faced. Still conditions for the fourth quarter are mixed, with certain markets continuing to show positive momentum while other markets remain challenged, including those markets more impacted by the current interest rate environment. We remain consistent throughout market cycles is our commitment to serving our customers and we remain confident that our creativity will continue to create opportunities next year and well into the future. We look forward to sharing more with you in November. Now I'll turn it over to Sean. Sean Pelkey : Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. I'd like to start by reiterating our appreciation for the tireless work of our fellow railroaders to help friends, communities and the network recover from the devastating impacts of the recent hurricanes. From a business standpoint, Helene impacted revenue by $10 million to $15 million at the end of the third quarter and drove a small amount of incremental expense. It appears the fourth quarter storm-related impacts will be larger than Q3 and with a current estimate of around $50 million. That includes storm recovery and rerouting costs near $20 million as well as roughly $30 million of net revenue impacts. Additionally, a significant rebuild process is already underway for miles of track and multiple bridges across our Blue Ridge subdivision. While we're still evaluating the scale and timing of these capital expenditures, our early read is that rebuild costs will likely exceed a total of $200 million, and the construction will take us into next year. Now to the discussion of the third quarter results. Capitalizing on powerful momentum generated over the last several quarters, the ONE CSX team delivered 7% operating income growth in the quarter, with EPS up double digits. Our proven operating model and increasingly collaborative approach with customers delivered profitable growth at strong incremental margins. In fact, combined merchandise and intermodal revenue, excluding fuel, has grown by at least 3% for seven consecutive quarters, including 5% growth in the most recent quarter. Total revenue increased by 1%, impacted by lower coal revenue as well as declines in fuel recovery, other revenue and trucking. Expense momentum continued as costs were down 2% with more detail to come on the next slide. Interest and other was stable compared to the prior year while income tax expense increased $16 million, with higher pretax earnings, partly offset by a lower effective rate. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. Total third quarter expense fell by $36 million. While lower fuel prices were a key driver, other costs were up just slightly as efficiency gains and other items mostly offset costs from inflation and 3% volume growth. Turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe was up $45 million due to inflation and higher total head count. The sequential cost increase from the second quarter was driven by the July 1 union wage increase along with higher incentive compensation. Employment levels have remained stable throughout this year with carload growth of 3% in excess of 2% head count growth in Q3. I would also note about half of the year-over-year head count increase is from quality trucking conversions of outside party drivers to company drivers. Adjusting for this head count would have been up just 1% versus the prior year. Purchased services and other expense decreased by $25 million driven by lower casualty expense and a favorable inventory adjustment in the quarter, with ongoing efficiency gains, mostly offsetting inflation. Depreciation was up $13 million due to a larger asset base. Fuel costs decreased $73 million driven by a lower gallon price and improved efficiency. The operating team delivered our best quarter of fuel efficiency in three years, benefiting from both tactical operating initiatives and increased utilization of fuel-saving technology. Equipment and rents decreased by $3 million, while property gains were unfavorable by $7 million. Now turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 13. Free cash flow continues to be strong at over $2.2 billion. Investing for the safety, reliability and long-term growth of our railroad continues to be our first priority use of capital. After fully funding these investments, we remain committed to our balanced and opportunistic approach to returning cash and have distributed over $1.9 billion to our shareholders year-to-date. Economic profit highlights our priority to grow operating income while maintaining capital discipline and pursuing high-return investments while lower year-to-date economic profit grew in the third quarter. We remain focused on increasing economic profit over the long term and are confident that focus aligns with the interest of our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. Joe Hinrichs : All right. Thank you, Sean. Now I will finish our prepared remarks by going over the guidance updates for the remainder of the year. As I outlined at the beginning of the call, we are proud of what our ONE CSX team delivered in the third quarter. As planned, we grew volumes, revenue and operating margin. Now going into the fourth quarter, near-term conditions look modestly more challenging. As I mentioned at an investor conference last month, we knew that lowered diesel prices and the decline in global benchmarks for met coal will be a drag on revenue over the second half and the fourth quarter specifically. Since then, we've gone through two hurricanes in our service region, and have also seen volumes softened in a couple of key customer segments like metals and automotive, a bit more than we were expecting. Practically, this means that we expect modest volume growth in the fourth quarter supported by favorable markets like chemicals and ag as Kevin talked about, that continue to perform very well for us. Lower fuel and coal prices, together with that modest volume growth are leading us to expect a slight decrease in total revenue for the fourth quarter. As we show here, we estimate that lower fuel surcharge and the total effects of a slightly softer coal market will lead to roughly $200 million in revenue effects year-over-year just on their own. Our merchandise franchise continues to run very well, and our operations team is pushing ahead with efficiency measures that are having real benefits. However, slightly lower revenue combined with additional expenses as we reroute and rebuild after the hurricanes are going to limit our near-term margin gains. We are still aiming for $2.5 billion in total CapEx this year. As Sean described, we will likely see some additional capital needs for hurricane rebuilding, some of which will occur in 2024 calendar year. Finally, there is no change to our commitment to a balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns via buybacks and a growing dividend. Let me close with this. We give many updates today. There is some near-term uncertainty in the market, and we are rebuilding after two major hurricanes. So we have had to adjust our short-term assumptions in response. All that said, the bottom line is that CSX is running very well, and we are building momentum across the railroad. This continues across the second half of 2024, and we'll keep building into 2025. We are excited and just in a few weeks, we'll be hosting many of you at our Investor Day in Amelia Island, we are going to give you more detail on our strategy to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. We encourage you to bring your best questions for the whole team. For now, we're ready to answer your question about the quarter. Matthew, please start the Q&A process. Matthew Korn : Thank you, Joe. We will now proceed to our question-and-answer session. As you all can appreciate, to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to take part in the time that we have, we ask you to please limit yourselves to one and only one question. Operator, we're ready to start the process. Operator : The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Brian Ossenbeck : Just wanted to ask a big picture question about price cost and your ability or how strongly you think you can get back to a positive spread in price cost next year. You have the labor negotiations that have already set a price for increase on the average comp side. So maybe you can give us a little bit of sense in terms of how those conversations are going with customers now that, that market is already being set in the market? And if there's anything on the other side you have to get out of those negotiations when you work towards more of the work rest tools? Sean Pelkey : Brian, it's Sean. I'll start and then kind of kick it over to Kevin to talk about conversations with the customers. But just when you think about price cost, we've been consistent saying all year long, that spread between dollars of price and cost of inflation has been positive all year long and about as positive as we've seen in the last decade. So, we're not necessarily seeing anything negative in that regard and not seeing a turn in that either so that's very favorable. In terms of kind of the setup in the inflationary environment for next year, wage inflation. We expect north of 4% next year, these tentative agreements, some of which have already been ratified or at 4% midyear next year. We have 4.5%. We just increased here in July. So that will carry forward. That's 4.25% for next year for wages. Health and welfare expenses look like they may actually be lower than that. So, I think wage inflation, including health and welfare will actually be less than 4%. And then inflation across the rest of the book likely to kind of be in line with what you're seeing in terms of overall PPI, maybe call it, 2.5%, 2% to 3%, somewhere in that ballpark. So, it's not like the equation is extraordinarily challenging. And I think -- kick it over to Kevin to talk about conversations and how that's going with the customers. Kevin Boone : Yes. I think there's a couple of factors. Certainly, I think we've been highly successful this year and exceeded our plan coming into the year despite a trucking market that obviously has been more persistently down than what we had thought. So, I think that's probably an opportunity next year. So, it's a watch item, but probably more an opportunity than a risk. Hopefully, as we move through the year. And that's where we're competing today more and more versus that truck. And so that would be a helpful dynamic for us. But overall, we do expect inflation to come down over time, and that would be reflected in some of our price, but we still obviously look for ways to cover our costs and do those things in the right way, but really focus on delivering service. And if we deliver the right service and that service continues to improve, then customers see the value in that and we're able to price to that service. Joe Hinrichs : And Brian, it's Joe. One last thing. You mentioned work roles at the end there, three-part question. The reality is, Mike, myself, many of us believe that in order to have the real meaningful conversations with our union partners on safety and work rules, you have to get beyond the wages and the benefits conversation. And that's one of the reasons why we've been so fortunate to reach these type of agreements, and be able to get past that so that we can then spend the time over the next several years working together on improving our efficiency, improving our safety, but also listening to our employees on their needs for work rules for work-life balance, those kind of things we're scheduling. And we're excited about the opportunity to do that in partnership once we get past the kind of national bargaining type topics of general wage increases and benefits. And Sean mentioned that we're really excited about the fact that we're actually going to be able to reduce some of the health care-related costs associated with our union employees next year. So, a lot more to come on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa of Citi. Your line is open. Ari Rosa : So, I'm curious, obviously, we're dealing with a loose trucking market. It's been that way for a while. In terms of upside to intermodal pricing for next year, maybe you could give us some indication on how those conversations are progressing with customers? And then obviously, 1% revenue growth is a little bit soft, is there anything you can do in terms of mix to maybe accelerate that beyond that kind of low single-digit type number, whether it's focusing more on the merchandise side or again, fixing that mix on the intermodal pricing? Kevin Boone : Yes. Well, obviously, the success we've had in merchandise is a very good mix factor for our business. And you'll hear in November that there's a lot of exciting things that we see but within our merchandise markets and what we're doing and the teams that got a lot of great work, but I won't to preempt that today, and we'll share that in November. But when we think about intermodal pricing, there was an intermodal customer of ours that spoke yesterday, and they're certainly closer to the market dynamics on a day-to-day basis than maybe we are. But I think there is some hope that at least we brought them here and at some point next year, we would anticipate some increases because the truckers out there aren't very profitable right now, and they end up having to cover their costs at some point. So, we're seeing probably slower than people expected supply coming out of the market, and that will adjust, and I think that will provide opportunities to convert more volume in the East and hopefully at better rates. And as you know, in many cases, we're tied to that. So, we have some spot market business and others, we follow the price as our customers benefit from that. So, it will be a gradual path forward, but I do think it's probably a better backdrop than what we saw in 2024. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chappell of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Jonathan Chappell : Sean, you throw a lot of numbers at us on the short-term stuff, $200 million from fuel and coal and then the $50 million from the hurricane impact. I know it's still early in the quarter, I know there's a lot that can happen. But when you take those things, mix in kind of the softer auto and metals, when you talk about revenue being down moderately and operating margin reducing. So, I'm guessing that's deteriorated sequentially. What kind of magnitude are we looking at there? Are we talking about tens of basis points or substantially greater based on what you see today? Sean Pelkey : Yes, Jonathan. There are a lot of numbers. So yes, and you got them all right. So, thank you. So, Joe mentioned the revenue headwinds, those are year-over-year in terms of fuel and coal. That probably translates into about $100 million of operating income headwinds year-over-year in Q4. nd then add on that, what we're estimating for now to be roughly $50 million from the hurricane, that's a significant headwind on a year-over-year basis that will make it challenging to grow operating income challenging to grow margins. What that means on a sequential basis is normally, you would see seasonality Q3 to Q4 margins might get a little bit worse. They'll probably be worse than normal seasonality as a result of all the dynamics that we're seeing there including the impact of the storms. In terms of how much worse, I think we're still working through cleanup and recovery, still hoping that we can recover some of the revenue that's been lost and obviously, keeping focused on efficiency efforts. Mike mentioned, even with volume up 3%, we took starts down 3% in the third quarter. So, there's a lot of momentum there. There are some things that we can do to help offset it. But it will certainly be worse than normal seasonality in terms of margins and operating income Q3 to Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Group : So, Mike, as you're trying to balance service and efficiency, any thoughts on head count trends from here and overall sort of cost trends? And then, Sean, I know you had a comment about the comp per employee stepping up sequentially, any thoughts on how to think about that going forward? Mike Cory : Let's start with headcount. First of all, our focus is on retention when it comes to headcount. Overall, we're hiring for attrition, people leaving and it's actually at an escalated rate than what we want. So that's a big focus is to bring that rate down because there's churn in the headcount, people that are here for two years and so and then they leave. Second, we're good in pretty much every location with a couple of locations in the Northeast that we're still hiring for. It's not a big number. But I don't see -- I see our head count getting better for that matter as we get more fluid. You got to remember -- maybe you don't, but in July, we probably had our best operating and customer service metric month throughout the year, and then we got into all these difficulties. So, getting the railway back in shape here over the next few weeks is job number one. The cost that you referred to -- our focus is to continue to deliver the service, but make sure that we're extremely efficient not hung up on anything other than the cost it takes us to get there and what they need. And so I see the cost continuing to be a betterment there, it's just with the disruption to our network. As Sean has mentioned, this next quarter is going to be not where we want to be, but the approach we've taken where we've minimized the amount of starts through all this disruption still handled more volume. I see more of that, yes. No question. Sean Pelkey : Yes. And I'd just add on the head count piece there, Scott. We normally -- at least last year, we saw an increase in head count from Q3 to Q4. We'll probably see an increase this year, just very modest. And the reason for that is you've got the train and engine hiring pipeline, what we're hiring for right now essentially is midyear next year, vacation peak so those folks will get marked up and qualified right about the time and attrition gets a little bit higher about that time. But that will be modest, we still expect volume to grow in excess of headcount, especially when you normalize for the quality company driver piece that I talked about. In terms of comp per employee, we normally see a little bit of a step up Q3 to Q4, and that's related to a few different factors. The first is that you start winding up some of your capital programs. So, we have employees that charge more of their time to operating expense at that time of the year, vacations as well. And then I would add on to that, this year, the impacts of the storm driving some higher overtime in the early weeks of the quarter here. So all those factors, I don't think it's going to be significant, but we should see a little bit of an increase in labor per employee. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Your line is open. Tom Wadewitz : Two questions really for Kevin. How do you think about the sensitivity of you're doing this multiyear work and industrial development, a lot of -- kind of, I guess, a long-time horizon work? Do you think there's some degree of sensitivity those projects to the cycle? It does seem like you talked about a mixed outlook, and it seems like there have been some weakening in certain markets in 3Q, is that something that people slow down projects? And I don't know if there is some kind of election-related impact. But just wanted to see if you could offer any thoughts about maybe how cycle and other uncertainty might affect how rapidly projects come on in '25, '26. Kevin Boone : Yes. I think -- it's certainly a factor. And I think we've seen announcements, obviously, on the EV side, which is actually -- you'll see this in November, a very small portion of our portfolio, and we've adjusted for that when you see the portfolio. But that is a factor. I mean, with the economics, what the economy is doing at the time will either accelerate or decelerate some of these. But when the shovel is in the ground and the capital is already being put to work, those projects want to obviously go to utilization and get a return. And we're seeing a lot of these projects have shovels in the ground currently. So, we have a lot of visibility that they're going to happen. Could they slip by three months or six months? I think that's possible. We're not -- I don't think we're seeing it in a broad way other than maybe the EV, obviously, announcements that we've seen, but those are 6 to 12 months ago. So yes, I think that's a factor, but I think we feel very, very confident given what we've seen in the capital already spent in a lot of these larger projects for us that those are going to be tailwinds for us. And we'll give you a lot more visibility to that in November. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is open. Brandon Oglenski : Joe, I know you addressed this with the first one, but maybe I think it's worth coming back to the new five-year agreement that you guys signed with, I think, 3.5% inflation locked in. A lot of investors just question like why go early there, especially as inflation is coming down, like couldn't you get a better deal if you waited? But in your response, you said like there's things we're looking to do differently here. And I know when you came to this industry two years ago, you said, look, labor relations are something I want to focus on. So, can you elaborate on what you hope to get out of this on the other end? Joe Hinrichs : Sure, Brandon. Thanks. I mean, first of all, when we all travel the network and talk to our employees, I can tell you the single largest thing, other than safety, which is always a topic of conversation that employees told us was they didn't like what happened last time. They didn't feel at any way, shape or form part of ONE team and didn't feel like they were appreciated in value. They went three years without a raise during very highly inflationary time period and during COVID, when they were essential workers and all the things that happened there. And both the union presidents that we spoke to and the union leaders and the employees all said, we don't want to do that again. And I can tell you, having been there on the days they were voting, Congress told us, don't come back here again. So that's a long way of saying that it's really important to remember that no one was satisfied or happy with what happened last time. So if we just go on the same path we've always been, we'll repeat that. And we'll say, once again, everyone was unhappy. And as Mike talked about, one of the most important things that we do for our network is stabilize our employment levels, get the experienced people to stay and create an environment where people want to be here to help us provide great service and do it safely and efficiently. All those have come from people who are motivated to be part of the team, but also who have experience and stay here. So, we sat down as an industry and talked a lot about what happened last time, and we endeavored as a coalition to try and reach a voluntary agreement early with willing Union Partners, which was over several -- we weren't able to do it as a coalition, but then quickly we were able to do that with CSX. And as you saw in Oakland Southern and BNSF followed pretty quickly. The good news here is there's been basically a pattern established, for lack of a better word, of what the economics are going to be. Sean mentioned, there's going to be some health care reduction costs coming to us and to our employees next year, which is great. But also, we start with the 4% next year, but the fifth year is at 3.0% and that's really important. So, it goes 4%, 3.75%, 3.5%, 3.25%, 3% that's really important because yes, inflation is coming down. You have to remember that we're in an environment where people are seeing these headlines from Boeing or the ILA or other things that are bigger numbers because they're going back to periods before COVID in some cases where they didn't get extensive raises. So, there's a lot of mixed messaging out there. Our view is this is the right approach for CSX, it's the right approach for how we're working as ONE CSX team to make sure our employees feel valued and appreciated and respected and listened to and that our belief is that you get the national agreements out of the way on the wages and benefits and then you can go to work on how you work together to improve the efficiency of the network, work on safety, as Mike talked about, and also listen to other issues that need to be resolved. We have five years to work on that now without the noise of the national negotiations. If you look at what happened last time, we never really got too many of the local work rule stuff because we -- took three years through the national agreement. So that's how we're looking at it. I think you can see the efficiency that we saw in the third quarter and the incremental margins on the volume in the third quarter were substantial. And that's the power of this network when we have our employees and everybody working together to serve the customer efficiently. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christian Wetherbee of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Christian Wetherbee : I know it sounds like fourth quarter from a margin standpoint, difficult to make year-over-year headway given some of the headwinds that you're talking about which makes sense. I guess when you think about it for a full year, I think that probably means sort of little margin in '24. I know I'm asking you guys to look out a little bit here, but kind of conceptually, with the environment that we have today with sort of weakness in some areas, maybe some strength in some company-specific strengths in other parts of your network. Is this the type of environment that you think you can consistently grow margins in? I guess what are the sort of puts and takes that you think you need to see as we move into '25 for that to continue to happen or resume to happen again? Sean Pelkey : Yes, Christian, thanks for your question. Obviously, for '25 specifically, we're still in the middle of the planning process, so it's a bit early to kind of definitively say anything. But what I would say, broadly speaking, and longer term, we'll highlight this at the investor conference in a few weeks as well is the setup for CSX in terms of where the service product is at how that's impacting the customer experience and the interactions that that's creating, which translate into growth opportunities, not to mention continuing to be able to price at or above inflation is very supportive. The other piece of that, of course, is the fact that the network has capacity. We have locomotives, we have crews. Like Mike mentioned, there are some places we're still hiring. But for the most part, we're only hiring for attrition, we've got line of road capacity. So, you take all that together, it's a good setup for strong incremental margins. There's always things, we can't control that could make it more challenging or easier for us to achieve margin improvement and operating income growth, which, frankly, is the first goal. Operating margin is really sort of the outcome of all of it as we grow into the existing capacity. Fuel prices are down. If you look at where they're expected to be next year, it should be another headwind for us. Export coal prices seem to have stabilized. But if you carry that out to next year, that would be a headwind for us next year. We're going to do a lot of construction on the Howard Street Tunnel next year in Baltimore that will cause some reroutes, some network disruption, not to mention the rebuild coming out of these storms. So, there are some things that will make it a little more challenging. We may see some tailwinds from the trucking market. We're watching that closely and hopeful that the environment there is a little easier next year than it was the previous year. But certainly, longer term, having the capacity to grow and continuing to deliver a consistent high level of service to the customer is a winning equation for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Your line is open. Daniel Imbro : I guess, Kevin, I wanted to dig into just the volume growth side. I mean you mentioned some share wins in truck to rail conversions. I'm curious if you can just add more color around maybe the cadence of wins or what categories they fell into during the quarter. And then I think there's some concerns out among investors around merchandise pricing. So, I'm curious how is merchandise pricing out in the market today? And are you seeing business that you're winning being more price competitive than past bids? Or there's any change in that as you win this business? Kevin Boone : Yes. We certainly compete every day, right? And we have a great service product that's only getting better, and that's obviously been reemphasized by some of the surveys that we do with our customers. So that's certainly a lot easier environment to sell into that than in an environment where your service isn't great. And we experienced that a couple of years ago where we were challenged with obviously head count and some other things. So, nothing's changed from that perspective, and the team is focused on that. We want to deliver value to the customer and the value -- when we're able to do that through service, the customers are willing to pay for it. And we're always looking for ways where we can provide value outside of price, can we cycle their assets and reduce their capital spend and do other things that create efficiencies for our customers. And those are great discussions that we have all the time and probably more so today that with Mike and his team are being very helpful in those conversations. So, there's not a big dramatic change in that. As we go into next year, as I mentioned, the trucking market, Sean touched on this, I think that's helpful. We are successfully converting truck volume in our merchandise franchise, which I can say is probably more than what we've done since I've been in this role. And we've got a momentum around that. What could even inflect that higher is certainly a tighter trucking market where customers aren't seeing savings by doing nothing. When you sit around and you have to do nothing, you're getting savings, you're not as compelled to maybe move some of that freight over to the rail. When that changes, and that environment changes, I think the team is really ready to capitalize on that. So, I think that's -- we're hopefully in the early innings of that. But despite all of those headwinds on the trucking market, we have converted in areas across the board, and you're seeing it in our numbers, forest products in other areas, metals and equipment. We expect some great conversion there over time by the team, and we see those opportunities more and more as we move into next year and the years beyond that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jordan Alliger : Just a question. You indicated in your remarks that you're seeing a modest improvement or uptick or something along those lines for domestic intermodal. I'm wondering if you can give a little more color on that kind of looking now relative to international, which I know had been really driving things in intermodal. And is it enough to sort of move the needle on your yield for intermodal at this point? Kevin Boone : I think at this point, we're safe to call that it feels like the bottoming, certainly, and that gives us hope that we've reached that how -- what the inflection will be and look like. That's a watch item for us. There was talk and pull forward, we're not hearing about that as much, but that's TBD. We expected hopefully a more normalized peak season, but that's a watch item for us, but we're optimistic that, that will occur, and we're planning for that as well. So, we do think the fundamentals don't support a lot of the trucking supply out there, and that's going to rebalance certainly, probably took a lot longer to rebalance given some of the influx of profitability they experienced during the pandemic. And so, they were sitting on a lot more cash to ride this cycle out than maybe previous cycles. Hopefully, I think you'll learn through the earnings calls with the other truckers and others that they're seeing some stability as well. But we're seeing stability, I wouldn't say an inflection at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Your line is open. Stephanie Moore : I was hoping you could talk a little bit about some of the diverted volumes that you called out ahead of just the labor negotiations and potential strike in the East Coast. Maybe if you could talk about the impact that you did see during the quarter? And then kind of what you're hearing and seeing now in terms of those volumes returning back to normal flows and normal to the East Coast? Kevin Boone : Yes. I mean it was a little bit modest. We did see some shipments naturally move over to the West Coast, and then we would have benefited from that moving from the West to the East, but it was relatively modest. We did see some impact, obviously, with the port shutdown on the East Coast. You saw that for a few days and then I've got to tell you that our operating group on the intermodal side was ready to ramp back up immediately. So very little disruption coming out of it. But those were some lost days that we would expect to recover through the rest of the quarter but it did impact us on a near-term basis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Your line is open. Ken Hoexter : Maybe you talk a little bit about export coal demand and the stability in the market given the growing importance and volatility, how stable can we look at this level of demand? Because obviously, we talked about the benchmark pricing and what happens on the yield side. And then Joe, Mike, you mentioned the service levels multiple times. How do we align the service levels with what we get to see, which is the erosion in the on-time originations and arrivals down into the low 70s, upper 60s, maybe you can just walk us through that? Kevin Boone : Export coal, my favorite subject. I think when you look at this market over a long period of time, in any cyclical market do you see supply response when the prices are really good and then you obviously see demand response when the macro is not so great globally. What I do think is different going forward is you don't see the supply response like you did in the past. Obviously, the financing and other investments aren't there to bring on new volume into the market. And I think that's a better backdrop for the market we serve and the mines that we serve today in the global competitive environment. So, I'm hopeful that, that creates more price stability longer term. And the other thing is their cost his risen globally as well. And so, I think the natural price for coal is probably going to stabilize above where it is today, and that gives me hope that we'll see better pricing environment going forward. Certainly, what you've seen here recently is a China stimulus, and that's been the talk, right? And they are a big consumer of coal in the global market. And that has given some optimism there that, that could recover. So, it's a global -- we compete in the global market. Our customers compete in the global market, but I do think the supply or the lack of supply response going forward is probably a healthier environment for us and makes me optimistic on our met business, in particular, that we'll see that more stable in the future. Joe Hinrichs : Sorry, it was a two-part question. Look, Ken, to put it as basic as I can, we really focus on the CSD number. So, if you want a number, that's the one -- that's our first and last mile. That's the one we say customer basically lets us know what they need and we bring it. So how we get the cars there on the trains, regardless of the weather conditions, we have a big automotive network that we don't necessarily -- we run a scheduled plan, but it changes quite a bit between loading. So, we don't change the train schedules other than to modify to where they're going to. So, the on-time performance isn't as important as the car cycle and that's how we look at it. So yes, you're right. We want to be like -- seven out of 10 trains are running on time, what we're watching for is to make sure the cars that are on those trains are getting to where they need to fulfill the customers' needs. You can take dwell, you can take car velocity, all those things, you're trying to balance it, first of all, the service product you promise to deliver, and that's really back to the CSD number. That's the one we look for that. And then how we get it there, we're trying to do it the cheapest and most efficient way. So, I'm not saying it's not important, but we have been very those last not just those weather here, but this last six months since I've been here, we have been really trying to find a way to fund the efficiency and the service. And the numbers right now, I'm not going to say they're blurred. They're all important, but we're balancing each one. And yes, disruptions hurt our on-time performance and that has been reflected this last quarter. Like I said, if you go back to July, you can start to see where we're going. So, it is a focus, but it's one of a few that we balance to get those end results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan of Stifel. Your line is open. Ben Nolan : Yes. I wanted to ask a little bit just on pricing. It seems like the one area or one of the areas where we actually have been able to get a little bit better pricing is on the chemical side. Is that -- chemical specifically, is that just a function of a healthy market where there is some pricing ability? Is it maybe starting to see some impact from quality or just maybe talk through how the chemical part of the business is evolving? Kevin Boone : Yes. I think there's a lot of factors that obviously play in the RPU length of haul, all those things. I don't see the chemical market really that different from some of our other merchandise markets where we've been successful. So, I know optically maybe on an RPU basis, that appears to be the case. But I think when you look at across that merchandise portfolio, there's really not a big deviation between the markets as our service continues to get better, as I mentioned before, as we deliver, as we can cycle their cars faster and save them capital, all those things factor in and deliver value to the customer in other ways where we can monetize that through price. Operator : From the line of Jason Seidl of TD Cowen. Your line is open. Jason Seidl : I wanted to talk a little bit about intermodal yields. I mean there was a lot of movement of freight from the East Coast to the West Coast in anticipation of the port strike. Do you see that switching back? And if so, what sort of impact should we expect on the yields? And then I guess I'd throw a quick one here, too. How are you feeling going to that January 15 date the ILA, do you think it could be Strike fears 2.0? Kevin Boone : I don't have any inside look at how that's going, but it certainly will be a watch item for us. I'm hopeful that obviously, the agreement will become well before that and create some -- and eliminate some of the uncertainty that, that could create again for us. When I think about freight and the movement of freight, it naturally wants to move to a certain port and efficiently. And so you've seen the East Coast outperform the West Coast over time. Some of that's because of the manufacturing shift you're seeing, some of that away from China and other parts of the world and more naturally wants the land on the East Coast. I think that continues from everything as you see us trying to decouple from China and those factors, and that's a great thing for us. If you look at the investments that are being made on the East Coast versus the West Coast, I think those are supportive of outgrowth, and we'll participate in that as well. But in many ways, we're somewhat agnostic if again, if freight wants to move in the west and move to the East Coast, that's not a bad thing for us. That would traditionally would truck and so that's an opportunity for us. I do think over time, as we continue to see the East Coast volumes continue to increase, I think we can push more into Chicago and other areas. That's an opportunity, and we'll see that further play out here over time. And then the underline port strategy that we have is going to create a lot of value, and it's going to open up opportunities for our customers look differently at shifting even more freight over to the East Coast because we can efficiently move it in inland with our East Coast ports in a very, very efficient way. So, I don't think we'll get through this noise on the -- obviously, the labor negotiations. But overall, I think the trend continues and we're going to benefit from that as a railroad. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Your line is open. Bascome, perhaps your line is in on mute. Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital. Your line is open. Walter Spracklin : Just curious on the competitive marketplace. I know there was a lot of discussion on truck, but I know your main competitor on the rail side is affecting quite some meaningful changes that is leading to impacts on their service. I'm wondering if you're seeing that come up in the marketplace at all? Are you seeing any -- is there any larger contracts that are coming up that you see as either an opportunity or a risk here? Just to get a better handle on how much of an improvement in your competitors operations is affecting or impacting you in terms of winning or losing business in the marketplace. Kevin Boone : Yes. I think -- look, as I mentioned before, we compete every day. We compete knowing that we have very, very good service that continues to improve. And I think the customers have seen that stability in the leadership team that we have though, the consistency of our message and what we're trying to achieve and they understand our objectives, which is to grow with them. I think that's very helpful when you get into those discussions that they understand where we're going and that there's still going to be stability among the leadership team and the team that we've built. So, we continue to have a very, very effective cost base. We can compete when we need to compete both on service and cost. And I think in those cases, we're going to be very, very competitive, and we're going to be winners in that situation. So, we're focused, obviously, on other opportunities, too. We want to grow the pie. We want to grow the market. We want to move the freight that's not moving on rail as well. And I think having those discussions along with retaining our own business is really helpful in retaining that business. So that's where we're focused on right now is growing the pie. And I think we're going to have a lot of success. We've had a lot of success this year, and we're going to continue to have that success as we move into next year and the years beyond that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. David Vernon : So, Joe, it sounds like you invested a lot in the culture part of the equation. I'm wondering if you can share some perspective on how some of the churn rates or turnover rates, however you guys measure them internally, internal Net Promoter Scores, that kind of stuff, has changed as a result of those investments? Joe Hinrichs : Yes. Thanks, David. I mean First of all, we look at many metrics, but as we've talked about many times, culture is kind of hard to measure. I've likened it to love, which is you kind of know it when you feel it, but you can't really measure it. That being said, we see it in many ways. For example, we do Net Promoter Scores with our employees. And both on our management side and our union side, those numbers have moved meaningfully in the last two years. They're not where we want them to be on the union side. And we still have work to do there, but they've come up significantly from where they were just two years ago. Mike mentioned what we're looking at in the form of attrition, both in our new hires, but also mid to longer term hires. Attrition rate on new hires is really important to us because we invest six-plus months of training in them as a conductor. And if we lose them, after all that, we have to start again, especially in some key sites so that's really important. But it's more than that. I mean, if you look at the efficiency gains we're getting on, quarter-over-quarter over quarter this year, and importantly, Kevin mentioned it, the best Net Promoter scores we've ever had since we've been measuring on our customer side, those are all impacted by attitudes and the work that our employees do. And if they feel part of the team and feel listen to and valued and appreciated, they're going to give us a better outcome for our customers and better efficiency in a safer environment for everybody. So, it's hard to measure with one thing, but I can tell you that we feel very strongly that we're seeing the efforts that we put in and the results that come from that. We've had roughly 20 family days, there were 30,000 people attending, it's the kind of environment where people want to be a part of. People are telling us over and over again, they're proud to wear CSX gear in their communities again. All those things are important for retention and attracting talent, but they're also important for how people work together. I've said many times, this is a service business and service business must really work hard on their cultures and their employee engagement because the employees are the ones who provide the service. And if you would have seen all the notes we've received this year, from our employees thanking us for reaching out to every employee in the regions impacted by the hurricanes, making sure they need anything, whether it's a generator or it's water or anything. And the notes I'm receiving and our team is receiving and they know they're not a number. Those things are important in our business. They're important for attrition -- sorry, they're important for retention, but they're also important for the energy that we have that feeds into ultimately our customers. So, we believe it's working and you can see it in the numbers. And Sean mentioned we have seven quarters in a row now where we've grown merchandise intermodal revenue by 3% or more at seven quarters in a row in an environment that's been complicated and you also see it in the resiliency of our network and how quickly we respond to issues and how quickly we can get back up and running. I mean -- the last thing and you've heard a lot about weather and hurricanes today, and you probably -- you don't want to hear any more about it, but the people that have been around here a long time, 30-plus years, are telling me that the impact of Helene on our network is the second most impactful hurricane they've seen at CSX, Katrina being the worst. I tell you the scale of things we're dealing with. And yet we're talking about an impact of $50 million in the quarter. As Sean noted, Obviously, we have some significant capital cost to rebuild the network, but that's people working together with a spirit and a motivation. It doesn't come if people don't feel like they're part of ONE CSX team. So, also been getting national agreements done before they expire. That's never happened in the railroad industry. Those are examples of things that are happening because of our culture and because of how we're working together. Ultimately, that plays out in the customer service we deliver in the safety, we actually deliver. And Mike mentioned it, our severity rate is down dramatically in injuries over the last several months. That's really important. The injury rate hasn't really moved, but severity rates moved dramatically. That's the kind of thing you get when people are working together and their culture builds from there. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our time that we have for Q&A. And with no further questions, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your attendance. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise and after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. You may begin. Matthew Korn : Thank you, Abby. Hello, everyone, and good afternoon. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In the presentation accompanying this call, which is available on our website, you will find slides with our forward-looking disclosures and our non-GAAP disclosures for your review. With that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs. Joseph Hinrichs : All right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter call. As we look back and review 2024, we see that our railroad faced a significant number of challenges during the year, including weaker commodity prices, a bridge collapse and multiple hurricanes. We had another year where US industrial production was effectively flat, reflecting mixed end markets across our customer base. There were also some labor disruptions across North American supply chain, which added economic uncertainty. But it's so impressive that through all of this, our ONE CSX team continued working together to improve our overall business. We have been resilient, adapting to changing markets and operating conditions, while remaining focused on our commitment to customer service. Last year was different than we planned, but we are proud of what we achieved and how we achieved it. We are confident because we know that our momentum continues to build and we are ready for the important year ahead of us in 2025. Now as shown on the first slide, we achieved a lot over 2024. CSX achieved 2% volume growth for the year, outpacing the industrial economy yet again. We accomplished this even with a number of constraints on our coal franchise, including the collapse of Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. Our leading merchandise business delivered 3% revenue growth, even after absorbing the effects of much lower fuel surcharge, soft metals market and the hurricane disruptions. We delivered strong consistent customer service and our customers have responded. You heard this for yourselves at our recent Investor Day and you can see it in our financial results as we are able to price according to the value we are delivering. Operationally, we worked across our network to reduce waste, unlock capacity and improve responsiveness. We took more steps in building a successful culture that can deliver more sustainable, efficient performance and drive more positive momentum for the business. We also led the rail industry in reaching early agreements with our labor unions on our five-year contracts, working together to value our employees, avoid the prolonged labor battles of the past and provide certainty for our customers. Now we can review some of the results of the fourth quarter. Slide 2 highlights key metrics for our fourth quarter compared to last year. As we expected, our underlying operations performed well, but we did see the impacts of substantially lower coal and diesel prices. Hurricane effects also weighed on revenues and expenses for the quarter as we noted in our October call. Total volume grew by 1% versus last year in the quarter. The largest contributor was growth in intermodal volume, which gained 4%. Quarterly revenue declined by 4%, largely due to lower global coal prices and a decline in fuel surcharge. Earnings per share declined 7% on an adjusted basis, excluding the effects of the goodwill impairment this quarter. Overall, we executed well through a difficult period. However, we are not satisfied with these results. We have a clear vision of what we want to achieve at CSX as we shared with you at our recent Investor Day and we are committed to delivering on that vision for the benefit of our customers, our employees and our shareholders. Now, I will turn the call over to Mike to discuss our operational performance. Mike Cory : Thank you, Joe, and I really appreciate you all taking the time today to participate. So first, I want to thank our team for the tremendous efforts through the quarter and the year and I'm really truly proud of this team. From weather to structural challenges like the Blue Ridge or Howard Street Tunnel, they worked together to minimize the impact on our customers and they did all of this while controlling costs and building a safer work environment for our employees and the communities they operate in. Let's go to the first slide. The fourth quarter saw a sequential decline in FRA injuries, which reflects our continuing initiatives around transforming our safety culture. However, the full year rate remained elevated compared to last year. A positive result of our efforts has been a significant reduction in our employees' lost time associated with injuries. We finished 2024 with the lowest total work days lost in the calendar year in company history. For FRA accidents, we saw a quarterly year-over-year increase, but finished largely flat on an annual basis. We strongly believe that our work in the field on hazard identification and exposure controls combined with our focus on newly hired and trained employees will continue to reduce significant injuries and accidents. And through improved efficiency in our capital work, we continue to harden our main lines and infrastructure more effectively. We clearly see how our Safe CSX initiative is creating positive fundamental changes in both our safety leadership and the workplace environment our employees are in. Over to the next slide. On this slide, you can see the impact of the strong hurricanes that passed through much of our service areas at the beginning of the quarter and flowed through to our customer service metrics. Much of the impact to our trip plan compliance came directly from our inability to deliver cars to customers due to the effects of the storm. Our customer switch data shows that we maintained relatively good first and last mile switching considering the challenges. However, it remains our focus for improvement. I'm confident that our team will deliver in these metrics as you progress through the year. I'm also very pleased with the progress that we've made in developing our field employees to be more responsive to customer needs. As this development takes hold, we have a much better understanding at the local level on how to manage costs through proper service process. Over to the next slide. As I stated earlier, 2024 brought various weather-related challenges over the last two quarters that have affected our overall operating metrics. We entered Q4 still dealing with the residual effects of the previous storm such as the Blue Ridge reroutes. Hurricane Milton in particular caused long periods of recovery for the various commodities to move into and out of Florida. This resulted in increased well for our traffic in our largest volume state. It also affected other parts of the network as we were unable to run our regular cadence on some flows throughout the storms up to recovery. On the velocity side, we were able to maintain, excuse me, we were able to continue increasing our capacity and maintain our speed through very close management of our train starts. This also benefited our locomotive utilization and overall transportation, engineering and mechanical costs. As we worked hard in adverse conditions to maintain our network fluidity, we also drove strong improvements in efficiency. The top right of the slide shows the gains we've made in fuel efficiency, which has resulted in millions of dollars in savings in this last year. The chart on the bottom reflects how we're using less power per ton of freight moved, another indicator of better operating efficiency. Further, over 2024, our engineering, transportation and network teams work together to improve our work block performance. This resulted in substantial improvements in the amount of rail, ties, and ballast per manhour compared to the previous year and we're seeing great productivity gains here, but there's still much more improvement that we expect to get going forward. For the Howard Street Tunnel, we've commenced rerouting traffic and our start date of February 1st is on target. This project was initially planned to take three years and create extensive daily track outages over one of our key corridors. I'm extremely proud of the team for being able to turn this around from a three-year project to one that will take six to eight months for the tunnel to be operational. We will benefit from this improvement forever and far faster than originally planned. At the Investor Day, I spoke about the opportunities at Cumberland. The team is 90% complete with the site's reconfiguration and the results have been great. Already, we've doubled the number of cars processed per day, meeting our initial target. And with completions still to come, we are focusing on much more in terms of improvements. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our progress on many of the fronts. All our initiatives discussed at Investor Day are proceeding and while 2024 had numerous challenges, we made fundamental improvements in many areas that will benefit us over the long run. We've increased transparency in the relationship between cost and service for our operating managers. As a result, our service continues to improve while our costs stay in line with expectations. Our Safe CSX program is well underway and the team is defining and implementing key process changes with our operating employees, bringing benefits to employee retention, as well as improving reliability and resiliency across our network. Considering the various challenges that came about last year, I'm very pleased and confident in the operating team's response and their collective work in both restoration and tackling our initiatives going forward. So looking forward, I believe we're well positioned to deliver our objectives in 2025 and beyond and we're all looking forward to capitalizing on the opportunities as they present themselves. With that, over to you, Kevin. Kevin Boone : All right. Thank you, Mike. First of all, I do want to thank the entire sales organization for all their hard work throughout 2024. As Joe and Mike have described, we faced numerous challenges across our network this past year and our team responded with a steady commitment to serving our customers, highlighted by our fourth quarter Voice of the Customer survey where we saw the Net Promoter Score reaching an all-time high. We continue to see mixed conditions across the markets we serve. Industrial output remains muted. Interest rates are still high and the truck cycle has yet to inflect. With that said, we hear optimism from our customers as they consider the potential for supportive domestic economic policies and we continue to see strong activity into 2025 with new project inquiries into our industrial development group. Our focus remains to drive outgrowth in the markets we serve, continuing our track record of exceeding industrial production. Let's review merchandise business as shown on Slide 8. For the fourth quarter, revenue and volume were flat compared to last year. But on a full year basis, revenue was 3% higher with a 1% increase in volume. Looking across the end markets, chemicals remained strong in the fourth quarter, consistent with the full year performance with volume increasing 6%. Robust demand for plastics and LPGs has driven much of the growth throughout 2024. Minerals volume was supported by positive demand for cement and aggregates and forest products volume was up 3% as CSX capitalized on continued demand in paper markets and pulp board. On the other side of the markets, volume for fertilizers business was impacted this quarter as supply chains here in Florida felt the lingering effects of hurricanes. Performance within metals remained sluggish as it has been all year, largely due to continued soft demand for steel. Volume for our automotive business declined 2% for the quarter as higher dealer inventories have led to lower build rates. Looking ahead to 2025, we are seeing strong demand signals in our ag and fertilizer segments along with continued strength in minerals and chemicals. Interest rate sensitive markets, including automotive, metals and housing, continue to remain challenged. While we anticipate a slower start in the first quarter, we do expect moderate merchandise carload growth for the full year, supported by steady service-driven conversions and new industrial development projects that should accelerate as we exit 2025. Now let's turn to Slide 9 to review the coal business. Coal revenue declined 20% for the quarter on 7% lower volume as we've navigated the effects of reduced global benchmark pricing and production issues. All-in coal RPU declined 14% year-over-year and 4% sequentially in line with previous guidance. Export volume fell modestly, largely due to lower supply availability from certain coal mines with temporary geological issues limited production. That said, for all of 2024, export coal volume grew by 9%, even considering the impacts of the Key Bridge and the shiploader outage at Curtis Bay. Exports represented more than half of our coal carloads for the full year, a first for CSX. Domestic shipments were pressured during the quarter, driven by lower natural gas prices and ample utility stockpiles. More recently, we have seen colder winter weather that has begun to reduce utility stockpiles, providing incremental opportunities as we move into the summer months. As we look into 2025, we anticipate a decline in coal volume with the weakest year-over-year performance in the first quarter. This includes temporary production outages at a couple of its CSX serve mines that will mainly impact the first half of 2025 from a year-over-year volume perspective. Based on current global benchmark prices, we expect all-in coal RPU to be down roughly 3% sequentially in the first quarter. As we have highlighted previously, we also see a couple of plant closures at domestic utilities that are scheduled for later this year. Despite these challenges, our utility customers are facing accelerating growth in power demand across areas of our service network, where data center build-outs are in progress. Lower utilization rates at existing CSX serve utilities does provide opportunities to work with customers to meet increased demand. Turning to Slide 10 to review the intermodal business. Fourth quarter revenue declined 5% on a 4% increase in volume with lower diesel prices year-over-year significantly impacting revenue per unit by 7%. Our domestic intermodal business performed well for the quarter, converting traffic from over-the-road even in this challenging truck market. We have been -- we have many initiatives underway, including continued growth in our direct business, new volume related to our Myrtlewood interchange, future improvements in double-stacking capabilities into the Mid-Atlantic and many others that make us optimistic about our growth ahead. Within international, orderly performance remained robust, allowing us to deliver strong growth for the full year as we gain from alignment with our key customers. Overall, we continue to compete and win intermodal business. Our inland port initiatives remain on track and we're excited about the prospects of closer alignment with our channel partners. As the political and trade landscape shifts, we will remain in close contact with our customers, ensuring that we will be able to adapt to their needs. As we look ahead to 2025 and beyond, there's a lot to be excited about. With that, let me turn it over to Sean. Sean Pelkey : Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon. Reported operating income and earnings per share both fell by 16% in the fourth quarter, impacted by a $108 million or $0.04 impairment of goodwill related to quality carriers. I'll now speak to the fourth quarter income statement on an adjusted basis, excluding the goodwill impairment charge. Revenue was lower by about $140 million or 4%. Declines in fuel and export coal benchmark prices as well as business interruption from the hurricanes drove a combined impact of around $200 million. Despite these challenges, the team delivered an eighth consecutive quarter of 3% plus growth in combined merchandise and intermodal revenue, excluding fuel. We remain focused on operating efficiently and delivered an adjusted expense reduction of 2% with more details on the next slide. Interest and other expense was stable compared to the prior year. Adjusted income tax expense decreased $33 million. The effective tax rate of 22% included a $26 million benefit, largely driven by the revaluation of the state deferred tax liability. Our expected tax rate going forward continues to be 24.5%. As a result, adjusted earnings per share fell $0.03, including a $0.06 combined impact from hurricanes, net fuel price and lower export coal benchmarks. Let's now turn to the next slide for a closer look at expenses. Fourth quarter adjusted expenses decreased $40 million. Turning to the individual line items, labor and fringe was $26 million lower, driven by lower incentive compensation expense and other items, partly offset by inflation. As expected, headcount increased slightly from the third quarter attributed to the timing of train and engine employee hiring aiming to qualify the new employees ahead of the 2025 summer vacation season. We expect to absorb volume growth in 2025 with average headcount remaining stable versus current levels, while cost per employee will be higher year-over-year in line with labor inflation. Purchase services and other expense increased $43 million. The variance includes approximately $25 million of smaller impairment charges, which were largely offset by a favorable legal settlement. Additional variances were driven by inflation, expenses related to the timing of locomotive modernizations and storm recovery costs. Depreciation was up $17 million on a higher asset base, in line with the rate of quarter-over-quarter increase we expect in 2025. Fuel cost was down $86 million, driven by a lower gallon price and a fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year efficiency savings. Finally, equipment and other rents increased by $7 million, while property gains were $5 million unfavorable in the quarter. Now turning to the discussion of full year adjusted results on Slide 14, revenue finished 1% lower for the year on 2% volume growth while adjusted operating income was 3% lower and adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.01. This includes over $400 million of operating income headwinds from the discrete items we have discussed throughout the year. As a result of our increasingly collaborative approach with customers, consistent operational execution and cultural improvements flowing to our frontline employees delivering the service product, our customers are rewarding us with steady and profitable volume growth. In fact, volume increased in all four quarters for the first time in 10 years, while full year merchandise and intermodal pricing gains were once again above cost inflation. At the same time, we remain highly focused on controlling costs, eliminating waste and improving efficiency. Mike and the operating team made impressive strides in fuel efficiency during 2024, resulting in approximately $45 million of savings. PS&O cost increased by just $50 million versus 2023, inclusive of headwinds from prior year insurance recoveries as well as storm-related costs in 2024. Core PS&O expense was stable in the face of inflation and 2% higher volume, benefiting from numerous initiatives across operating and G&A functions. PS&O will be pressured in 2025 by the Howard Street Tunnel project as well as ongoing locomotive modernizations and cloud computing expense, but we are committed to unlocking further savings. Our headcount stabilized during 2024 with volume gains outpacing employee growth over the second half of the year and we expect to continue delivering labor productivity gains going forward. Turning our attention to 2025, this company is headed in the right direction. We're building a strong culture, serving our customers at high levels, pairing new business wins and industrial development opportunities with ongoing efficiency to deliver strong bottom line performance and investing for the future. That said the three considerations listed on this slide could drive significant net unfavorable impacts this year. As we enter the year, export coal benchmarks and fuel prices are working against us. And if they remain stable, it would result in a combined $300 million impact versus 2024 with nearly half of that in Q1 alone. On the flip side, we expect a roughly $50 million net operating income benefit from cycling unique events, including hurricanes and the Key Bridge collapse, net of anticipated higher incentive comp in 2025. Finally, as we've outlined before, major construction projects on the Howard Street Tunnel and Hurricane-impacted Blue Ridge Subdivision will drive an incremental $10 million per month net impact into Q4. Q1 operating income will be our trough, well below prior year. Results will improve from there and we expect to return to year-over-year growth in the second half. At our Investor Day in November, we presented a theme of proven model with powerful momentum and profitable growth. Despite the discrete pressures, the ONE CSX team remains confident in our long-term guidance. Let's now discuss cash flows and distributions on Slide 16. Investing in the safety and reliability of our infrastructure is our highest priority use of cash. Additionally, 2024 capital spending included increased allocations towards rolling stock and other return generating investments that support a pipeline of future growth and efficiency opportunities. The 2024 infrastructure figure also includes around $50 million of initial spend on our Blue Ridge Subdivision following the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene. We now expect total cost to exceed $400 million before insurance recoveries as we work diligently to reopen this important route that will serve our customers for generations to come. Strong cash flow also supported close to $3.2 billion in shareholder returns for the year, including over $2.2 billion in share repurchases and $900 million of dividends. The share repurchase program once again outperformed with CSX purchasing shares at a 2% discount to the market price in Q4, delivering value to ongoing owners. Our economic profit finished lower for the year, largely due to the discrete items mentioned on the prior slide. Our goal is to increase economic profit over time, which has been shown to strongly correlate with outsized shareholder returns. With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. Joseph Hinrichs : All right. Thank you, Sean. We will finish up our prepared remarks by discussing our expectations for 2025. As you heard from Kevin, many markets remain uncertain as we look ahead at the full year. Operationally, we are undertaking substantial projects to rebuild the Blue Ridge Subdivision after Hurricane Helene and expand the Howard Street Tunnel in Baltimore. That said, the momentum we have built with our leading customer service gives us confidence that we can deliver volume growth in the low to mid-single-digit range, driven by our merchandise and intermodal business We expect volumes in the first quarter to show the effects of weather and a slow start for the auto industry and then build over the course of the year. Given scheduled coal plant closures and a number of mine production issues, we do anticipate coal volumes to be lower year-over-year in 2025. Next, consistent with our commentary over the last few months, we expect full year revenue to be impacted by lower global benchmark pricing for coal and reduced fuel surcharge, particularly in the first half of 2025. Mix will also be a factor as the intermodal business has the lowest RPU, but is likely to show the fastest growth this year. Our efforts to drive efficiency improvements and manage controllable costs will continue. As Sean discussed, the Blue Ridge rebuild and the Howard Street Tunnel project will add expense over the year, but our team is working hard to deliver productivity gains. And given our current outlook, we expect to hold our headcount effectively flat for the year. We plan on CapEx being roughly flat year-over-year, excluding spend on the hurricane recovery, which we report out throughout the year. And finally, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to invest in the safety and fluidity of our network, execute on high return growth projects and opportunistically distribute excess capital to our shareholders. To sum up, I am proud of how the ONE CSX team responded to the challenges that we encountered over 2024. There are great opportunities ahead in 2025 and the longer term. We will execute and deliver on them on behalf of our customers and our shareholders. I have no doubt that CSX will continue to move forward and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. We'll now be happy to answer your questions. Matthew, let's begin the Q&A process. Matthew Korn : Thank you, Joe. We will now proceed to a question-and-answer session. To make sure that everyone has the opportunity to take part in the time that we have, we ask you to please limit yourselves to one and only one question. Operator, we're ready to start the process. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is open. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah, good afternoon. I wanted to see if you were pretty clear on some of the headwinds and it sounds like a lot of those are in 1Q and first half. How do you think about full year margin performance. And if you kind of come out with some strengthening in volume in the second half, can you see it potentially improve, or is that tough to do given the how meaningful some of the headwinds are? Sean Pelkey : Hey, Tom, it's Sean. So, yes, I mean, I think clearly the headwinds are going to be concentrated here in the first half of the year, worse in Q1 than Q2. So first half of the year, I think margin improvement is sort of out of the question unless something changes with commodity prices or what have you. As we get to the second half, yes, I mean, I think it's quite possible we see not only growth in operating income, but margins as well in the second half assuming that the environment that we're operating in remains stable. The core fundamentals remain in place. We're going to grow volumes low to mid-single-digits and that will be very supportive to operating income and margin growth over time, particularly as some of these headwinds ease, given the capacity that we have on the network to absorb that growth. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. So similar question, but not about margin, just about like operating income dollars, do you think we grow operating income this year or is that I get down a lot in the first quarter, it sounds like up in the back half. When you add it all up, do you think we grow operating income this year? Sean Pelkey : Hey, Scott. So obviously, we didn't give specific guidance on what that's going to look like over the course of the year. What I would say is, if those headwinds that we outlined of $350 million weren't there, we would deliver pretty solid growth in operating income this year low to mid-single-digit, volume growth at 50% to 70% incremental margins that we talked about at the Investor Day is a good setup. We do have some other challenges this year in terms of some of the utility coal headwinds that Kevin outlined, the mine issues that we've got right now as well as some of the closures later on in the year. So that makes this year a little bit worse. But going forward, we feel pretty good about being able to hold those coal volumes relatively stable with some opportunity in exports. So on an adjusted basis, what I would say is, if you were kind of looking at our Investor Day guidance of mid-to-high single-digit operating income growth, this year, we'd be towards the lower end of that, if you adjust for the discrete headwinds. And then in the following years, we'll see a bit of a rebound, particularly as we cycle some of the issues around or some of the costs related to the construction projects we've got going on this year. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Your line is open. Joseph Hafling : Great. This is Joe Hafling on for Stephanie Moore. Thanks for taking our questions. Maybe stepping away from the guidance for a second, relative to when we last spoke on your Investor Day, I was wondering if you could highlight any incremental conversations you guys have had with customers related to the industrial development pipeline, if there's any tangible things you can point to just relative conversation with customers you've been having over the last couple of months post-election? Thanks. Kevin Boone : Yes, I think when we're coming into this year, obviously, given the political landscape changing pretty rapidly here. We thought there might be a pause in activity and new projects going out for bid. We've actually seen quite the opposite. We've seen that really stay healthy and where a number of new projects have come our way that we're working on and the group is very, very busy. So I think that's a big positive for us. Obviously, there's a long tail to those projects. You have to get them permitted and then get them underway. But we see that strength that we noted at the Investor Day really continuing in the first quarter here and hopefully accelerating with some of the obviously a policy that may take place here in the next few months. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Christian Wetherbee : Yes. Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Sean, I just want to pick up on the comment that you mentioned. I think you said that ex some of the cost items, you'd be in the sort of mid-single-digit or the lower-end of sort of the EBIT range. I guess I want to make sure I understand that dynamic in the context of low to mid-single-digit volume growth. So I guess when we think about some of the other puts and takes that would drop from revenue down to or volume down to profit, can you talk maybe a little bit about the pricing outlook that you think about '25, how that compares to 2024? Sean Pelkey : Chris, I'll start and then maybe kick it over to Kevin on the pricing side. Yes, so essentially, what I was saying there is, if you take those $350 million of headwinds, assuming commodity prices on the coal and fuel side remain flat, you've got the network disruption as well as some of the things we're cycling from last year. And adjust for that, we'd be roughly in the kind of lower end of the mid to high single-digit range, plus or minus a little bit depending on what happens over the course of the year with the economic environment, but we feel very good about pricing. And I'll give Kevin an opportunity to speak to that. Kevin Boone : Yes, I think on the merchandise side, nothing really changing there. We continue to compete in the market and really leverage the service product that we have. The biggest difference versus last year, obviously, as you've seen on the commodity price for coal. So that's met coal prices have come down. As you know, our contracts reflect, move with those prices and so we've seen that. Hopefully, we'll see some strength pick up, but that's a -- that market is very, very dynamic. And I will say on the intermodal side, it's encouraging to see at least some stabilization and maybe some contractual rates starting to move up slightly. So, I'm not here to call the cycle. I think others are better prepared to do that. But as we see, hopefully through the year and into the back half, we might see a little bit more support than what we certainly saw last year in 2024. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa with Citigroup. Your line is open. Ari Rosa : Great. Good afternoon. So I just actually wanted to stay on that line of questioning. Maybe you could talk about the impact of tightening truck capacity and what's usually the lag in terms of where we would expect to see that reflected in results? And specifically, I assume it would be reflected primarily in intermodal, but if you could talk about kind of other areas where we might see that impact kind of flow through results would be appreciated. Thanks. Kevin Boone : Yes, the most obvious one is intermodal, but there is a lot of work that the team is doing on the merchandise side from a truck conversion point of view. And when you think about an environment where in the do-nothing scenario, a customer can get savings by staying with truck, even though the value proposition might be greater with rail, that there's not a lot of momentum to do that. Going into this year, I think some of our discussions are on the merchandise side can really accelerate as customers are looking for additional cost savings and we can really lean into that. So I'm optimistic that's going to be the case and that's the market that we can have a little bit of a supportive market, which we've been fighting the last couple of years here will be very beneficial to us. Intermodal, when we look at our pricing, it does lag the market a bit here. So contracts even though the shorter duration ones can be a year and a lot of that takes place in the first part of the year. And so, if we start to see some momentum, the bigger impact probably starts next year, but we could see some benefit as we exit this year. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for taking the question. Joe, I'm sure investors are excited here at the opportunity long-term for growth, but obviously, with some of the earnings headwinds when GDP is up, that might be a little frustrating in the near-term. But maybe can you talk to what this tunnel project will ultimately yield getting beyond some of the hurricane damage in the Blue Ridge region? And should we be thinking that 2026 could actually be that much better when you think about margin opportunity, incremental margins, pricing, volumes, et cetera? Joseph Hinrichs : Thanks, Brandon. Yes, I mean I think what you've heard from including other transports is that while the GDP has been growing, the industrial side of the economy has been flat or down over the last couple of years, which more closely aligns with certainly in the merchandise side of our business. And so the interest rate sensitive parts automotive is still well below pre-pandemic levels, housing market and steel, other things like that. So we're obviously looking forward to hopefully, whether it be interest rates coming down or other policy changes that will help the industrial side of the economy and maybe we'll see a little bit of growth this year for the first time in a couple of years. So certainly that will impact us. I think at a higher level, the Howard Street Tunnel project is one of the most important projects in this company. And as Mike highlighted in his commentary, we've been waiting for a long time to do this and we had a plan that was going to be a three-year plan that we've now accelerated into one year, which is going to be done in the 2025 calendar year. That, of course, means 2025 will have a lot more expenses tied to it for the rerouting costs and taking care of our customers while we do that, but we get the benefits much sooner than originally planned, which helps in '26 and '27 and those benefits include the ability for us to run double-stack all the way up and down the East Coast, including places from Chicago. There are trains we can't take right now from Chicago double-stack to the East Coast because we can't get through the Howard Street Tunnel and some bridges around that area. So you can go all the way out to our interchange with our Western rails and talk about the advantages that will help us. It's one of the -- probably if not the largest competitive disadvantage we have right now, our intermodal business has been the inability to double-stack and be able to reach the high population density sectors on the East Coast because of that. So this is a big deal. I mean, actually, if you step back between the MBR interchange that's now open, which was one of the other competitive disadvantages we had on intermodal and other parts of our franchise and now the Howard Street Tunnel, we're going to take care of probably the two biggest competitive disadvantages we had in our network by the end of 2025. So we're really excited about that and that's a big deal because right now, we have to double-stack, we have to route basically up through Upstate New York and down. So you can imagine all the weather in the winter doing that, but also the outer route miles are tremendous. And so and frankly, we can't run up and down that I-95 corridor with double-stack right now. So a big deal to us. We're looking forward to those benefits. And so, yes, that will contribute to more meaningful ability to grow profits in '26 and '27 along with other things that are going on, including industrial development, including the efficiency actions we're taking across the network and including all the work that we're doing with our customers. So we continue to be very excited about the potential of this business and support the targets and the stuff that we outlined at our Investor Day in November and though that if you can do the math now and say, okay, as Sean highlighted, '25 is going to be the lower end of that. That means we're still very strongly believe in our plan that '26 and '27 will be more supportive of making that happen. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess maybe one for Mike. Should we expect as this tunnel project gets underway, there are going to be some meaningful deterioration or adjustments that we're going to see in some of the service metrics? Just trying to figure out how that would play out considering it is such a big undertaking in a compressed period of time? And then maybe just also get your thoughts on just the general health of the network having absorbed a couple of hurricanes, a couple of port strikes or one year miss and just your thoughts on staffing levels because it sounds like you're already pretty well staffed up into next year. So getting through all this in the near-term, how do you feel like the network is positioned to hit that growth when it does come back perhaps in the back half of the year? Thanks. Mike Cory : Thanks for the question, Brian. I'm not going to get you to repeat the first part, but I can barely remember it. No, I'm just kidding. In terms of the tunnel, Brian, we have already -- we've taken steps in the fourth quarter to start to move traffic and rerouted off the tunnel and so we're prepared. The cost Sean is talking about really is reflective of what we have to do to maintain some of our customer commitments and detour somewhere else that we're paying a haulage for. But effectively I don't think the metrics are going to be affected that dramatically. We've pretty much moved everything off, so what you see is what you have now. In terms of the networks, yes, look, it was an interesting year. We started off in the second quarter really trying to focus on crew starts and looking at how our capacity was, our trains, how they were operating and our focus was to basically take crew starts down in line with the service offering we had to make and we started to do that and right up until and then we saw, again, as you reduce the crew starts or the train starts, your dwell goes up. So we made adjustments. And if you look in the middle of the year going into that third quarter, the first set of hurricanes, we were running very well. And on -- and those -- so those fundamental principles are still there. You keep, if you look, there's pockets, weeks where we didn't have the disruption from the hurricanes that we're -- I'm very, very happy with the performance of the railroad overall outside of those things. Going forward, yes, our headcount is stable. We have -- we do have more productivity improvements right in front of us once we get, look, we just had three days of -- two days of snow and record and all that. Once we get through this, we're back on track because going in, excuse me, going into the Christmas shutdown, we're in very good shape and we really, really took action working with our customers as they reduced their needs to really, really reduce more starts and that's -- our focus is first of all to run a safe railroad that employees know and come prepared for work and are able to do it. Number two, service those customers, but productivity is extremely important for us because we've made some great steps. We fought off the battles that we've had with these storms and then the team is very entrenched in the principles that got us to where we were before the storm started. So I'm very -- I'm happy with the network. We got work to do with all the different stuff going on right now like we always will. But overall, fundamentally, we're on the right track. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Jonathan Chappell : Thank you. Good afternoon. Sean, hate to get into minutia on certain model line items. You said cost per employee will be up aligned with labor inflation. So I assume you mean like 4%-ish. That said, you have a really tough comp and 1Q '24 was up 7% and then a super easy comp in 4Q '24 was down 4% because of the incentive comp. So do we think about it as 4% on average, but try to get the quarterly cadence more aligned with typically kind of lower cost per employee in the first quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter due to annual bonuses and incentive comp? Sean Pelkey : Yeah, Jon. So here's how I think about it. I would take the Q4 number. I would add back the incentive comp adjustment. So that's about $1,500 an employee and that's a pretty good run rate for the first half of the year. We may actually come in a little bit better than that in the first half of the year due to two reasons. One, looking very closely at overtime, trying to reduce that and other unproductive costs. But also it looks likely lower health and welfare costs that kick in here this year. Then as we get to the second half, take that first half run rate, add 4.25 -- 4% to that, which is what I would expect for second half wage inflation and that should give you a good way to model it for the full year. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ken Hoexter : Hey, great. Good afternoon. Two quick ones to clarify and then my question. I guess clarifying, Kevin, did you say met coal at these levels, the 191, is that down 3% sequentially? Is that based on these levels or does it go lower if rates hold at these low levels? And then you mentioned some outages -- some mine outages. Does that include the recent fire at one of your mines? I presume that's what you meant when you said some mine outages. And then I guess, Sean, my big question is on -- you kind of talked mid-single-digit growth, would it -- I guess that would have been about $260 million add to EBIT, offset by about $300 million discrete items. So I just want to understand, are you sending the -- I just want to understand your messaging, is it that the base case EBIT is down $50 million from the $5.35 billion that you've got for the target? I'm just trying to put together all the numbers you're throwing out there. Thanks. Kevin Boone : All right. Well, that was a lot. So let's start with the coal question. Yeah, at current levels, that's where we see -- that was the guidance at current levels, what we see here. Hopefully, we'll see some as we get into second, third quarter more reflective of kind of the cost curves of our producers and global producers. Quite frankly, we think it's probably under market right now and that should hopefully balance out above 200 as we get in the back half of the year. We'll see if that happens. And then the other question was the outage that you mentioned, yes, that's related to the recent one. We expect that to come back online in the second half of this year. I will say that the team is doing a great job of looking for other sources and we do expect some of that to be made up at other mine locations to basically backfill the demand that still remains out there. So we're -- we don't expect that to be a full loss. We'll find other opportunities to offset hopefully a lot of that -- more than half of that headwind that we'll see. Over to Sean. Sean Pelkey : Yes, Ken. So I mean, your math is awfully precise. It's too early in the year to kind of give you that close of a range. But I think generally speaking kind of the way you're looking at it, if you take the adjusted number for 2024, the non-GAAP adjusted number, you subtract the $350 million and then look at sort of mid-single-digit-ish growth and I would say there's some things this year that could make -- that can make it a little bit worse than that. And that's really the coal challenges as well as the incentive comp piece that probably adds another $30 million to $40 million of expense this year versus 2024. But there's a lot of other variables in there as well. We're very, very focused on the cost side to try to make sure we can manage through the first half of this year as we've got some big headwinds to manage with. And so there's levers that we can pull, but there's obviously things that we're watching in the economy as well. So there's a range of outcomes that we could model from here. And as we go through the year, we'll get much more line of sight into exactly where that lands and can give you a little bit more color there. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open. David Vernon : Hey, thanks guys for taking the question. So we've probably kicked this a couple of times, but Kevin, is there any way you can help us understand the $300 million, how much of that is volume, how much of that is price, kind of what you're making in there roughly slices of pizza and an eight-slice pie kind of thing? And then if you think about the outlook as we look into merchandise intermodal, it feels like the Q4 numbers ended a little bit below the full year numbers. I'm just wondering if you're also seeing some volume pressure because some of the Blue Ridge outage and maybe even some volume because of the service issues might be happening with the Howard Street Tunnel. Should we be thinking that there's some additional sort of volume headwinds building into 2025 here with related to this stuff or is it just purely just operating cost? Thank you. Kevin Boone : Let me handle the first part. That was quite a bit again. The $300 million that Sean highlighted in his opening comments was related to the met coal price and then obviously the fuel surcharge was -- so those two items, not a volume comment in that market and then I'll hand it over to Sean. Sean Pelkey : Yes. And I think, David, what you're pointing to in terms of the momentum there in Q4, you got to remember, the hurricanes were a pretty big impact. We talked about a $50 million impact with roughly $30 million of that being revenue. The revenue number was probably even a little bit higher than that when all was said and done. So that was a big piece of it. I don't, I mean, Mike and Kevin, you correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think we're anticipating any volume disruption from the shutdown of the Howard Street Tunnel. In fact, the work that we're doing and the costs that we're adding are to preserve that volume and allow us as we clear up that a pinch point in our network to actually be able to identify and pursue some growth opportunities that Kevin and the team are looking at. Kevin Boone : Yes, I think with the Blue Ridge, there's small but immaterial, maybe some volume that would move off temporarily just given the additional length of haul, but the majority of it, given the great work by the team and Mike's team and Carrie and others to come up with a solution really preserve that largely for us. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Bascome Majors : Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Can you talk a little bit about the regulatory opportunity under the new regime, either at the FRA and the STB. And anything that has been held up or slow play that could generate a needle moving productivity for CSX in 2025 or '26? Thank you. Joseph Hinrichs : Yes, Bascome, this is Joe. I'll take that one. I think, first of all, you already saw some activity on the waivers that have been longstanding that's important. We need to get more technology on the inspection side into this industry and we need to work with our union partners to make that happen, but there's a lot we can do to advance efficiency and safety while still having plenty of work for our teams to do. That's a big one. I think if you look at obviously Patrick Fuchs being named as STB Chair. We know Patrick well, very much involved and engaged in our industry along with the other Board members. So looking forward to that, working with the STB that's really focused on the data and what we can do to grow this business in a positive way. The FRA, I mean, David Fink, he was running Pan Am when CSX purchased it before my time, but so obviously knows the business and some of the stress points that the railroads faced in technology and also investment and capital and that kind of thing. So we're feeling really good about a supportive environment for the industry when it comes to safety and technology and working together to advance. I mean I think everyone is aligned that the best thing we can do is work together collectively to get more volume on the railroads. It's better for safety, better for efficiency of our economy. It takes trucks off the road. It takes -- reduces taxpayer funding for the roads a little bit and it also is more efficient and better for the environment. So although I think the people that we're working with now understand all that. And so I would say that the -- for the next several years look very supportive for us working together to make more advancements than we made in the last four. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ravi Shanker : Great. Good afternoon, everyone. So it's a couple of years of a meaningful amount of discrete items now and I recognize that a lot of these things are either issues outside of your control or investments in the future. But were your conversations with customers like on some of these bottlenecks? And are they understanding? Is there a risk of share shift as a result of this or kind of how you think this plays out in the coming years? Kevin Boone : Yes, I think from our customer discussions, there's a lot of excitement. You heard the service is not really going to be impacted. There's additional costs we have to absorb to maintain the service and maintain the level of service that we have provided, but these are significant investments that are going to allow them to reach new markets that they haven't had the opportunity to move on, on the CSX network. So I think there's a lot of excitement for our customers to see that we're willing to invest in our network, quite frankly, and that always hasn't been the case. So we continue to invest in the core infrastructure and invest there, but we're actually extending our network and creating single-line service that we haven't had the opportunity to deliver in the past. So there's a lot of excitement. And I know our teams are excited to kind of deliver on that growth. Joseph Hinrichs : Yeah, this is Joe. Let me add real quickly to that. I mean, I'm really proud of the team, how both our operating and marketing sales teams have worked together. I mean if you look at the third and fourth quarters, we had two pretty impactful hurricanes and some other things. But if you look at the data from our customers, actually, our Net Promoter Scores in third quarter and fourth quarter were consecutively the best we've ever had. And that even though we had some disruptions and we had issues and you see it in some of the data, the work we're doing to put the customer first along with safety, of course, and to really work on finding solutions even if we have issues, it goes a long way to them seeing the commitment we have. And that's really important for long-term growth that the customers see that we're committed to when we have disruptions or have issues that we were proactively communicating with them. We're working to find solutions and that makes them feel a lot better about investing back into rail and looking for longer-term growth and we're seeing that play out. So, yes, we've had a lot of discrete items, as you mentioned. I mean, for a couple of years now, we're looking forward to stop talking about fuel surcharge and met coal prices year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter, but we're continuing to see volume growth and that's consistent exactly with what we're hearing from our customers. Our service levels are leading to volume growth. That volume growth has strong pricing with it and we're continuing to get efficiency gains. We get some of this noise out of the system. I think you'll see the power of this network. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jordan Alliger : Yes, hi. Sorry, I just wanted to come back to the EBIT growth question again, where you had suggested taking that $350 million net headwind off of the adjusted 2024 and then growing by mid-single-digit, which sort of is the low-end of the mid to high-single-digit that you talked about at your Investor Day. But off that base like I'm just curious like what gets it to the upper-end of that mid to high-single-digit? Is it more of a volume issue? Is it a productivity issue? Like just sort of curious how you think about framing the range. Sean Pelkey : Yes, thanks for the question, Jordan. I think you know assuming commodity prices are not the driver good or bad versus where they are right now, what makes the year a little bit better. I think it's us continuing to push to drive even more efficiency across all of the groups between operations and G&A. We were able to hold purchase services and other costs essentially flat on a core basis last year. That takes a lot of work when you've got volume growth and you've got inflation up against you. So keeping a very, very close eye on those things. We've got initiatives built into the plan, but we're sitting down every day looking at ways that we can continue to sort of find opportunity, negotiate new agreements that help us on the purchase service side to reduce costs. So that's one. And then the other, I would say is on the volume side, certainly looking at the economy, but also the momentum on the trucking side, as Kevin talked about, do we start to see that turn? And these industrial development opportunities are coming online and the ramp in those volumes, the customer wins that we've got. We've got a number of those in the pipeline for this year. If our hit rates higher, that obviously helps us grow operating income as well. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Walter Spracklin : Yes, thanks so much, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. So I just want to come back to the Investor Day three-year forward compound annual growth rate targets that you gave, particularly on earnings per share. So you gave us high-single-digit to low-double-digit. If we look at that and just take the midpoint at 10% off 2024, it gets us to 243 for 2027, which is where consensus was. My question, I guess, is with the dip down now in 2025, it would imply you're going to have to run at a low-teen for '26 and '27 to get back to that 243. And my question is, is that -- is the Investor Day target of 243 still relevant, given where we are kind of stepping down in 2025 and therefore have that low-teen growth rate in '26 and '27 or do we say, no, this -- the world has changed a little bit since Investor Day and we should really model off a lower growth rate than that? Sean Pelkey : Yes, Walter. I appreciate the question. But as I said in the script, no, not -- we're sticking with the guidance. And so the numbers that you walked through, those are reasonable, high-single-digit to low-double-digit EPS growth. A couple of things I would just clarify. One is the $10 million a month of network disruption costs that we have this year. So that's a headwind to this year, but that completely reverses in 2026 and turns into a net benefit for us as we grow volume and drive efficiency when all the construction is done. And then just the other sort of modeling point I would put out there is that the three-year guidance assumes that over that three-year period, we have stable commodity prices, both export coal and fuel. So we're at a lower point today on both of those than we were on average in 2024. Our hypothesis, our modeling framework is that by 2027, we're kind of back to where we were on average in 2024. Obviously, if that doesn't happen and met coal stays below 200, it's going to be tough to hit the numbers. But adjusting for that, we still feel very good about our three-year guidance. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Your line is open. Daniel Imbro : Yes, hi. Good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, maybe one more on the volume outlook. I guess there's a lot of headwinds out of your control, but I was going to ask one on the auto side. We've navigated elevated inventories for a few quarters here and it's weighing on autos and metals. I guess any updates on when your customers are expecting that production to actually return to growth? This year inventories rationing down out there in the field. Just what are you hearing or seeing from your field as you think about that segment hopefully returning to growth at some point in 2025? Kevin Boone : Maybe I'll take it and give Joe you know he's obviously an expert in it as well. Look, we have seen a slower start to the year. That's shown up in everybody's carloads. It's out there. Certainly, the weather in loading autos and this kind of weather is a challenge as well. So that hasn't helped the volumes that we've seen here. We do expect them to improve from where we are at the levels that we've seen here over the last few weeks. But it is a -- I think it's an open question of where rates go and affordability and those things. I don't -- I wouldn't -- I don't sit here and say there's a lot of optimism here. I don't think there's a lot of pessimism that it's going to get significantly worse as well. So it feels like more of the same basically, but we'll see how it plays out the rest of the year. Joseph Hinrichs : Yes. Thanks, Kevin, and well said. I mean you think about it right now, I think the estimates are for sales this year to be in the low-16 million range and the production to be in the mid-15s, so that maybe adjusts some inventory or just takes into account everything that happens with imports and everything. But before the pandemic, those sales, SARs were 17 million plus for a number of years in a row and production was pretty close to that. And so there's a lot of potential there. We just have to see it realized and that means interest rates have got to come down and has to be a balance between all those things. So we have an administration now that is very focused on autos and US manufacturing and interest rates. So let's see how that plays out. Probably is a big an issue for '25, but what could it look like for '26 and '27 is a big opportunity. Thanks. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeffrey Kauffman : Okay. Thank you and thank you for squeezing me in. I'm going to go back and beat the dead horse a little bit here, but from a slightly different angle. You've talked a lot about the costs associated with Howard Street and Blue Ridge weighing on this year and that cost is coming in a bunch of different areas, the outer route miles and the fuel burn, the extra crew, the asset-related costs, extra locomotive, extra cars. Can we talk about, I guess, kind of the same way once Blue Ridge is fixed, once Howard Street is done, can we try and quantify the savings on the other side? So for instance, you're going to have double-stack where you didn't before. You should be able to drive more cars through there with fewer trains, fewer assets, you should get to go out there and play for business that you weren't really eligible to do before. As I look at the net unwind of these projects and the opportunity for '26, can you do anything to quantify that benefit the same way you quantified the cost of '25? Sean Pelkey : Yes, Jeff, I appreciate the question. And you're right, obviously, as we get past this, it's going to turn into a very nice positive for us. If we sort of look at the cost savings opportunity and then combine that with the growth opportunity that's out there, taking a kind of a midpoint of what we think that revenue opportunity is, I would say, within a couple of years, we will have fully recovered that $100 million of, call it roughly $100 million of operating expense that we're going to take on this year. So and that's just the initial growth opportunity. There's obviously more capacity that we're adding beyond that. So to my earlier point, it does turn into a nice positive for us over the three-year period. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call and we thank you for your participation.
